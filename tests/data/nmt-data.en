<p>
in Greek mythology , Achilles or Achil@@ le@@ us was a Greek hero of the Trojan War and the central character and the greatest warrior of Homer &apos;s &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; .
his mother was the immortal Ner@@ e@@ id The@@ tis , and his father , the mortal P@@ ele@@ us , was the king of the My@@ r@@ mid@@ ons .
Achilles &apos; most notable feat during the Trojan War was the sla@@ ying of the Trojan hero Hector outside the gates of Troy .
although the death of Achilles is not presented in the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; , other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris , who shot him in the heel with an arrow .
later legends state that Achilles was inv@@ ul@@ ner@@ able in all of his body except for his heel because , when his mother The@@ tis dipped him in the river Sty@@ x as an infant , she held him by one of his heels .
all@@ uding to these legends , the term &quot; Achilles &apos; heel &quot; has come to mean a point of weakness , especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution .
the Achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends .
</p>
<p>
linear B tablets attest to the personal name &quot; Achil@@ le@@ us &quot; in the forms &quot; a @-@ ki @-@ re @-@ u &quot; and &quot; a @-@ ki @-@ re @-@ we &quot; , the latter being the d@@ ative of the former .
Achilles &apos; descent from the Ner@@ e@@ id The@@ tis and a similarity of his name with those of river de@@ ities such as A@@ cher@@ on and Ach@@ el@@ ous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity .
Robert S. P. Bee@@ kes has suggested a Pre @-@ Greek origin of the name , based among other things on the coexistence of &quot; -@@ λ@@ λ@@ - &quot; and &quot; -@@ λ@@ - &quot; in epic language , which may account for a pal@@ at@@ alized phon@@ eme / ly / in the original language .
</p>
<p>
Achilles was the son of the Ner@@ e@@ id The@@ tis and of P@@ ele@@ us , the king of the My@@ r@@ mid@@ ons .
Zeus and Po@@ se@@ idon had been rivals for the hand of The@@ tis until Prometheus , the fore @-@ thinker , warned Zeus of a prophecy that The@@ tis would bear a son greater than his father .
for this reason , the two gods withdrew their pursuit , and had her wed P@@ ele@@ us .
there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events :
in the &quot; Ar@@ gon@@ au@@ tica &quot; Zeus &apos; sister and wife Her@@ a all@@ udes to The@@ tis &apos; chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus , pointing out that The@@ tis was so loyal to Her@@ a &apos;s marriage bond that she co@@ olly rejected the father of gods .
The@@ tis , although a daughter of the sea @-@ god Ner@@ eus , was also brought up by Her@@ a , further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus .
Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal .
according to the &quot; Achil@@ le@@ id &quot; , written by St@@ ati@@ us in the 1st century AD , and to non @-@ surviving previous sources , when Achilles was born The@@ tis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Sty@@ x .
however , he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him : his left heel .
it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier .
in another version of this story , The@@ tis anointed the boy in am@@ bro@@ sia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body .
she was interrupted by P@@ ele@@ us and abandoned both father and son in a rage .
however , none of the sources before St@@ ati@@ us make any reference to this general inv@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability .
to the contrary , in the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; Homer mentions Achilles being wounded : in Book 21 the Pa@@ e@@ onian hero A@@ ster@@ opa@@ eus , son of Pel@@ agon , challenged Achilles by the river S@@ cam@@ ander .
he cast two spears at once , one gra@@ zed Achilles &apos; elbow , &quot; drawing a spurt of blood . &quot; also , in the fragmentary poems of the Ep@@ ic Cycle in which one can find description of the hero &apos;s death , there is no trace of any reference to his general inv@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability or his famous weakness at the heel ; in the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles , the arrow hit his torso .
P@@ ele@@ us entrusted Achilles to Ch@@ iron the Cen@@ ta@@ ur , on Mount Pel@@ ion , to be reared .
The@@ tis foret@@ old that her son &apos;s fate was either to gain glory and die young , or to live a long but un@@ eventful life in obscurity .
Achilles chose the former , and decided to take part in the Trojan war .
according to Homer , Achilles grew up in Ph@@ thia together with his companion Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us .
according to Pho@@ tius , the sixth book of the &quot; New History &quot; by P@@ tol@@ emy Hep@@ ha@@ estion reported that The@@ tis burned in a secret place the children she had by P@@ ele@@ us ; but when she had Achilles , P@@ ele@@ us noticed , tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot , and confi@@ ded him to the cen@@ ta@@ ur Ch@@ iron .
later Ch@@ iron exhumed the body of the Dam@@ y@@ sus , who was the fastest of all the giants , removed the ankle , and incorporated it into Achilles &apos; burnt foot .
</p>
<p>
some post @-@ Hom@@ eric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war , The@@ tis hid the young man at the court of Ly@@ com@@ edes , king of Sky@@ ros .
there , Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Ly@@ com@@ edes &apos; daughters , perhaps under the name &quot; Py@@ r@@ r@@ ha &quot; .
with Ly@@ com@@ edes &apos; daughter De@@ id@@ am@@ ia , whom in the account of St@@ ati@@ us he rapes , Achilles there fathers a son , Ne@@ op@@ tol@@ em@@ us .
according to this story , Odys@@ se@@ us learns from the prophet Cal@@ ch@@ as that the Ac@@ ha@@ eans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles &apos; aid .
Odys@@ se@@ us goes to Sky@@ ros in the guise of a pedd@@ ler selling women &apos;s clothes and jewellery and places a shield and spear among his goods .
when Achilles instantly takes up the spear , Odys@@ se@@ us sees through his disguise and convin@@ ces him to join the Greek campaign .
in another version of the story , Odys@@ se@@ us arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Ly@@ com@@ edes &apos; women ; while the women flee in panic , Achilles prepares to defend the court , thus giving his identity away .
</p>
<p>
according to the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; , Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships , each carrying 50 My@@ r@@ mid@@ ons .
he appointed five leaders : Men@@ es@@ thi@@ us , E@@ ud@@ orus , Pe@@ is@@ ander , Phoenix and Al@@ c@@ im@@ ed@@ on .
</p>
<p>
when the Greeks left for the Trojan War , they accidentally stopped in My@@ sia , ruled by King Tel@@ eph@@ us .
in the resulting battle , Achilles gave Tel@@ eph@@ us a wound that would not heal ;
Tel@@ eph@@ us consulted an oracle , who stated that &quot; he that wounded shall heal . &quot; guided by the oracle , he arrived at Ar@@ gos , where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy .
according to other reports in E@@ uri@@ p@@ ides &apos; lost play about Tel@@ eph@@ us , he went to A@@ ul@@ is pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound .
Achilles refused , claiming to have no medical knowledge .
alternatively , Tel@@ eph@@ us held O@@ rest@@ es for ransom , the ransom being Achilles &apos; aid in healing the wound .
Odys@@ se@@ us reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound ; therefore , the spear must be able to heal it .
pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Tel@@ eph@@ us was healed .
</p>
<p>
according to the &quot; Cypri@@ a &quot; , when the Ac@@ ha@@ eans desired to return home , they were restrained by Achilles , who afterwards attacked the cattle of A@@ ene@@ as , sacked neighbouring cities and killed Ten@@ es , a son of Apollo , as well as Pri@@ am &apos;s son Tro@@ il@@ us in the sanctuary of Apollo Th@@ y@@ mb@@ ra@@ ios .
however , the romance between Tro@@ il@@ us and Chr@@ y@@ se@@ is described in Geoffrey Cha@@ uc@@ er &apos;s &quot; Tro@@ il@@ us and Cris@@ ey@@ de &quot; and in William Shakespeare &apos;s &quot; Tro@@ il@@ us and C@@ res@@ sid@@ a &quot; is a medieval invention .
in Da@@ res Ph@@ ry@@ gi@@ us &apos; &quot; Account of the Destruction of Troy &quot; , the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe , as well as in older accounts , Tro@@ il@@ us was a young Trojan prince , the youngest of King Pri@@ am &apos;s and H@@ ecu@@ ba &apos;s five legitimate sons .
despite his youth , he was one of the main Trojan war leaders , a &quot; horse fighter &quot; or &quot; chariot fighter &quot; according to Homer .
prophec@@ ies linked Tro@@ il@@ us &apos; fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him .
yet Achilles , struck by the beauty of both Tro@@ il@@ us and his sister Poly@@ x@@ ena , and overcome with lust , directed his sexual attentions on the youth - who , refusing to yield , instead found himself dec@@ ap@@ itated upon an altar @-@ om@@ ph@@ alo@@ s of Apollo Th@@ y@@ mb@@ ra@@ ios .
later versions of the story suggested Tro@@ il@@ us was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over @-@ ardent lovers &apos; embrace .
in this version of the myth , Achilles &apos; death therefore came in retribution for this sac@@ r@@ ileg@@ e .
ancient writers treated Tro@@ il@@ us as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents .
had Tro@@ il@@ us lived to adulthood , the First Vatican My@@ tho@@ grapher claimed , Troy would have been invincible .
</p>
<p>
Homer &apos;s &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; is the most famous narrative of Achilles &apos; deeds in the Trojan War .
Achilles &apos; wrath is the central theme of the poem .
the first two lines of the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; read :
the Hom@@ eric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade @-@ long war , and does not nar@@ rate Achilles &apos; death .
it begins with Achilles &apos; withdrawal from battle after being dis@@ honoured by Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non , the commander of the Ac@@ ha@@ ean forces .
Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non has taken a woman named Chr@@ y@@ se@@ is as his slave .
her father Chr@@ y@@ ses , a priest of Apollo , begs Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non to return her to him .
Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non refuses , and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks .
the prophet Cal@@ ch@@ as correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him .
Achilles does so , and Cal@@ ch@@ as declares that Chr@@ y@@ se@@ is must be returned to her father .
Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non consents , but then commands that Achilles &apos; battle prize Bris@@ e@@ is , the daughter of Bris@@ eus , be brought to him to replace Chr@@ y@@ se@@ is .
angry at the dis@@ honour of having his plunder and glory taken away , with the urging of his mother The@@ tis , Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces .
at the same time , burning with rage over Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non &apos;s theft , Achilles pra@@ ys to The@@ tis to convince Zeus to help the Tro@@ j@@ ans gain ground in the war , so that he may regain his honour .
as the battle turns against the Greeks , thanks to the influence of Zeus , Nest@@ or declares that the Tro@@ j@@ ans are winning because Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non has angered Achilles , and urges the king to appease the warrior .
Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non agrees and sends Odys@@ se@@ us and two other chief@@ tains , Aj@@ ax and Phoenix , to Achilles with the offer of the return of Bris@@ e@@ is and other gifts .
Achilles rejects all Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do .
the Tro@@ j@@ ans , led by Hector , subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships .
with the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction , Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us leads the My@@ r@@ mid@@ ons into battle , wearing Achilles &apos; armour , though Achilles remains at his camp .
Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us succeeds in pushing the Tro@@ j@@ ans back from the beaches , but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy .
after receiving the news of the death of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us from Anti@@ lo@@ ch@@ us , the son of Nest@@ or , Achilles griev@@ es over his beloved companion &apos;s death .
his mother The@@ tis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles .
she persu@@ ades Hep@@ ha@@ est@@ us to make new armour for him , in place of the armour that Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us had been wearing , which was taken by Hector .
the new armour includes the Shield of Achilles , described in great detail in the poem .
enraged over the death of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us , Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field , killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector .
Achilles even engages in battle with the river god S@@ cam@@ ander , who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed .
the god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Her@@ a and Hep@@ ha@@ est@@ us .
Zeus himself takes note of Achilles &apos; rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction , seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself .
finally , Achilles finds his prey .
Achilles ch@@ ases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena , in the form of Hector &apos;s favorite and dearest brother , D@@ ei@@ pho@@ bus , persu@@ ades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face .
after Hector realizes the trick , he knows the battle is inevitable .
wanting to go down fighting , he charges at Achilles with his only weapon , his sword , but misses .
accepting his fate , Hector begs Achilles , not to spare his life , but to treat his body with respect after killing him .
Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him , declaring that &quot; my rage , my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw - such ag@@ onies you have caused me . &quot; Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot .
after having a dream where Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us begs Achilles to hold his funeral , Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour .
at the onset of his duel with Hector , Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky , which comes on in the autumn , Orion &apos;s dog ; a sign of evil .
during the cre@@ mation of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us , he is compared to Hes@@ per@@ us , the evening / western star , while the burning of the funeral py@@ re lasts until Phosph@@ orus , the morning / eastern star has set .
with the assistance of the god Hermes , Hector &apos;s father Pri@@ am goes to Achilles &apos; tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector &apos;s body so that he can be buried .
Achilles rel@@ ents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral , lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th .
the poem ends with a description of Hector &apos;s funeral , with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come .
</p>
<p>
the &quot; A@@ eth@@ i@@ op@@ is &quot; and a work named &quot; Pos@@ th@@ omer@@ ica &quot; , composed by Quin@@ tus of S@@ myr@@ na in the fourth century AD , relate further events from the Trojan War .
when Pen@@ the@@ si@@ lea , queen of the Amaz@@ ons and daughter of A@@ res , arrives in Troy , Pri@@ am hopes that she will defeat Achilles .
after his temporary truce with Pri@@ am , Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen , only to grieve over her death later .
at first , he was so distracted by her beauty , he did not fight as intensely as usual .
once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life , he refocused and killed her .
following the death of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us , Nest@@ or &apos;s son Anti@@ lo@@ ch@@ us becomes Achilles &apos; closest companion .
when Mem@@ non , son of the Dawn Goddess E@@ os and king of Ethiopia , sla@@ ys Anti@@ lo@@ ch@@ us , Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield , killing Mem@@ non .
consequently , E@@ os will not let the sun rise , until Zeus persu@@ ades her .
the fight between Achilles and Mem@@ non over Anti@@ lo@@ ch@@ us echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us , except that Mem@@ non was also the son of a goddess .
many Hom@@ eric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; s description of the death of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us and Achilles &apos; reaction to it .
the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic &quot; A@@ eth@@ i@@ op@@ is &quot; , which was composed after the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; , possibly in the 7th century BC .
the &quot; A@@ eth@@ i@@ op@@ is &quot; is now lost , except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors .
</p>
<p>
the exact nature of Achilles &apos; relationship with Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times .
in the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; , it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship .
Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us were lovers .
despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; that Achilles and Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors .
commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures .
in 5th @-@ century BC Athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of &quot; pa@@ ider@@ ast@@ e@@ ia &quot; .
in Plato &apos;s &quot; Symposium &quot; , the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us were a couple ;
P@@ ha@@ ed@@ rus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us was the lover .
but ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women .
</p>
<p>
the death of Achilles , as predicted by Hector with his dying breath , was brought about by Paris with an arrow .
in some versions , the god Apollo guided Paris &apos; arrow .
some ret@@ ell@@ ings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow .
all of these versions deny Paris any sort of val@@ our , owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was , and Achilles remained un@@ defeated on the battlefield .
his bones were mingled with those of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us , and funeral games were held .
he was represented in the &quot; A@@ eth@@ i@@ op@@ is &quot; as living after his death in the island of Le@@ u@@ ke at the mouth of the river Danube .
another version of Achilles &apos; death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princ@@ esses , Poly@@ x@@ ena .
Achilles asks Pri@@ am for Poly@@ x@@ ena &apos;s hand in marriage .
Pri@@ am is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world &apos;s greatest warrior .
but while Pri@@ am is overseeing the private marriage of Poly@@ x@@ ena and Achilles , Paris , who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister , hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow , killing him .
in the &quot; Odys@@ sey &quot; , Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non informs Achilles of his pom@@ p@@ ous burial and the erection of his mound at the Hell@@ es@@ pon@@ t while they are receiving the dead su@@ itors in H@@ ades .
he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of I@@ lion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the Ocean .
Achilles was cre@@ mated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us .
Paris was later killed by Phil@@ oc@@ te@@ tes using the enormous bow of Her@@ acles .
in Book 11 of Homer &apos;s &quot; Odys@@ sey &quot; , Odys@@ se@@ us sails to the underworld and conver@@ ses with the shades .
one of these is Achilles , who when greeted as &quot; blessed in life , blessed in death , &quot; responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead .
but Achilles then asks Odys@@ se@@ us of his son &apos;s exploits in the Trojan war , and when Odys@@ se@@ us tells of Ne@@ op@@ tol@@ em@@ us &apos; heroic actions , Achilles is filled with satisfaction .
this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life .
according to some accounts , he had married Me@@ dea in life , so that after both their deaths they were united in the Ely@@ sian Fields of H@@ ades - as Her@@ a promised The@@ tis in Apol@@ lon@@ ius &apos; &quot; Ar@@ gon@@ au@@ tica &quot; .
</p>
<p>
Achilles &apos; armour was the object of a feud between Odys@@ se@@ us and Tel@@ am@@ onian Aj@@ ax .
they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bra@@ vest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners , who after considering both men , decided Odys@@ se@@ us was more deserving of the armour .
furious , Aj@@ ax cursed Odys@@ se@@ us , which earned him the ire of Athena .
Athena temporarily made Aj@@ ax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep , thinking them his comrades .
after a while , when Athena lifted his madness and Aj@@ ax realized that he had actually been killing sheep , Aj@@ ax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide .
Odys@@ se@@ us eventually gave the armour to Ne@@ op@@ tol@@ em@@ us , the son of Achilles .
a relic claimed to be Achilles &apos; bronze @-@ headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acro@@ polis of Ph@@ as@@ elis , Ly@@ cia , a port on the Pam@@ phy@@ lian Gulf .
the city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great , who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; with him , but his court bi@@ ographers do not mention the spear .
however , it was shown in the time of P@@ aus@@ ani@@ as in the 2nd century AD .
</p>
<p>
numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions .
at some point in the war , Achilles and Aj@@ ax were playing a board game .
they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle .
the Tro@@ j@@ ans attacked and reached the heroes , who were saved only by an intervention of Athena .
</p>
<p>
the tomb of Achilles , extant throughout antiquity in T@@ road , was ven@@ erated by Thess@@ alians , but also by Persian expedi@@ tionary forces , as well as by Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Carac@@ alla .
Achilles &apos; cult was also to be found at other places , e. g. on the island of A@@ st@@ yp@@ al@@ a@@ ea in the S@@ por@@ ades , in Spart@@ a which had a sanctuary , in El@@ is and in Achilles &apos; homeland Thess@@ aly , as well as in the Magna Gra@@ ec@@ ia cities of Tar@@ ent@@ um , Loc@@ ri and Cro@@ ton , accounting for an almost Pan@@ hel@@ len@@ ic cult to the hero .
the cult of Achilles is illustrated in the 500 BC Poly@@ x@@ ena sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us , where the sacrifice of Poli@@ x@@ ena near the tum@@ ulus of Achilles is depicted .
Stra@@ bo also suggested that such a cult of Achilles existed in T@@ road :
near the Sig@@ ei@@ um is a temple and monument of Achilles , and monuments also of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us and Anth@@ lo@@ ch@@ us .
the Ili@@ enses perform sacred ceremonies in honour of them all , and even of Aj@@ ax .
but they do not worship Hercules , alleging as a reason that he ravaged their country .
the spread and intensity of the hero &apos;s ven@@ eration among the Greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the Pon@@ tus Eu@@ x@@ in@@ us , today &apos;s Black Sea , appears to have been remarkable .
an archaic cult is attested for the Mil@@ esian colony of Ol@@ bia as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea , today identified with Snake Island .
early dedic@@ atory inscriptions from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea attest the existence of a heroic cult of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards .
the cult was still thriving in the third century AD , when dedic@@ atory st@@ el@@ ae from Ol@@ bia refer to an &quot; Achilles P@@ ont@@ ár@@ ch@@ ē@@ s &quot; , who was invoked as a protector of the city of Ol@@ bia , ven@@ erated on par with Olympian gods such as the local Apollo Pro@@ states , Hermes Ag@@ or@@ a@@ eus , or Po@@ se@@ idon .
Pl@@ iny the Elder in his &quot; Natural History &quot; mentions a &quot; port of the Ach@@ æ@@ i &quot; and an &quot; island of Achilles , &quot; famous for the tomb of that &quot; man &quot; , situated somewhat nearby Ol@@ bia and the D@@ ni@@ eper @-@ Bu@@ g E@@ stu@@ ary ; furthermore , at 125 Roman miles from this island , he places a peninsula &quot; which stretches forth in the shape of a sword &quot; obl@@ iqu@@ ely , called &quot; D@@ rom@@ os Achil@@ le@@ os &quot; and considered the place of the hero &apos;s exercise or of games instituted by him .
this last feature of Pl@@ iny &apos;s account is considered to be the iconic spit , called today &quot; T@@ endra &quot; , situated between the mouth of the D@@ ni@@ eper and Kar@@ kin@@ it Bay , but which is hardly 125 Roman miles away from the D@@ ni@@ eper @-@ Bu@@ g estuary , as Pl@@ iny states .
in the following chapter of his book , Pl@@ iny refers to the same island as &quot; Achil@@ lea &quot; and introduces two further names for it : &quot; Le@@ uce &quot; or &quot; Mac@@ ar@@ on &quot; .
the &quot; present day &quot; measures , he gives at this point , seem to account for an identification of &quot; Achil@@ lea &quot; or &quot; Le@@ uce &quot; with today &apos;s Snake Island .
Pl@@ iny &apos;s contemporary Pom@@ pon@@ ius M@@ ela tells that Achilles was buried on an island named &quot; Achil@@ lea &quot; , situated between the Bor@@ ys@@ then@@ es and the I@@ ster , adding to the geographical confusion .
ruins of a square temple , measuring 30 meters to a side , possibly that dedicated to Achilles , were discovered by Captain K@@ rit@@ z@@ ik@@ ly in 1823 on Snake Island .
a second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple .
a fifth century BC black @-@ glazed le@@ ky@@ thos inscription , found on the island in 1840 , reads :
&quot; G@@ lau@@ k@@ os , son of Po@@ se@@ idon , dedicated me to Achilles , lord of Le@@ u@@ ke . &quot; in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC , a statue is dedicated to Achilles , lord of Le@@ u@@ ke , by a citizen of Ol@@ bia , while in a further dedication , the city of Ol@@ bia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island &apos;s cult , again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra @-@ regional hero ven@@ eration .
the heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on &quot; Le@@ uce &quot; seems to go back to an account from the lost epic &quot; A@@ eth@@ i@@ op@@ is &quot; according to which , after his untimely death , The@@ tis had snatched her son from the funeral py@@ re and removed him to a mythical Λ@@ ε@@ ύ@@ κ@@ η Ν@@ ῆ@@ σ@@ ο@@ ς .
already in the fifth century BC , P@@ ind@@ ar had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a &quot; bright island &quot; of the Black Sea , while in another of his works , P@@ ind@@ ar would ret@@ ell the story of the im@@ mort@@ alized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite Island of the Bl@@ est together with other heroes such as his father P@@ ele@@ us and C@@ adm@@ us .
well known is the connection of these myth@@ ological For@@ tun@@ ate Is@@ les or the Hom@@ eric Ely@@ sium with the stream Ocean@@ us which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world , which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Eu@@ x@@ ine with it .
guy Hed@@ reen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by Al@@ ca@@ eus , speaking of &quot; Achilles lord of Scy@@ thia &quot; and the opposition of North and South , as evoked by Achilles &apos; fight against the A@@ eth@@ i@@ opian prince Mem@@ non , who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother E@@ os after his death .
the &quot; Peri@@ plus of the Eu@@ x@@ ine Sea &quot; gives the following details :
it is said that the goddess The@@ tis raised this island from the sea , for her son Achilles , who dwells there .
here is his temple and his statue , an archaic work .
this island is not inhabited , and goats graze on it , not many , which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships , sacrifice to Achilles .
in this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts , craters , rings and precious stones , offered to Achilles in gratitude .
one can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin , in which Achilles is praised and celebrated .
some of these are worded in Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us &apos; honour , because those who wish to be favored by Achilles , honour Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us at the same time .
there are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds , which look after Achilles &apos; temple .
every morning they fly out to sea , wet their wings with water , and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it .
and after they finish the sprin@@ kling , they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings .
other people say still more , that some of the men who reach this island , come here intentionally .
they bring animals in their ships , destined to be sacrificed .
some of these animals they slaughter , others they set free on the island , in Achilles &apos; honour .
but there are others , who are forced to come to this island by sea storms .
as they have no sacrificial animals , but wish to get them from the god of the island himself , they consult Achilles &apos; oracle .
they ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island , and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair .
but in case the oracle denies them permission , because there is an oracle here , they add something to the price offered , and if the oracle refuses again , they add something more , until at last , the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient .
and then the victim doesn &apos;t run away any more , but waits willingly to be caught .
so , there is a great quantity of silver there , consecrated to the hero , as price for the sacrificial victims .
to some of the people who come to this island , Achilles appears in dreams , to others he would appear even during their navigation , if they were not too far away , and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships .
P@@ aus@@ ani@@ as has been told that the island is &quot; covered with forests and full of animals , some wild , some tame . in this island there is also Achilles &apos; temple and his statue . &quot; Le@@ uce had also a reputation as a place of healing .
P@@ aus@@ ani@@ as reports that the Del@@ phic Py@@ thia sent a lord of Cro@@ ton to be cured of a chest wound .
Am@@ mi@@ anus Mar@@ cell@@ in@@ us attributes the healing to waters on the island .
a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles .
Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , Pl@@ iny the Elder and Stra@@ bo reported on the existence of a town &quot; Ach@@ í@@ l@@ le@@ ion &quot; , built by settlers from My@@ til@@ ene in the sixth century BC , close to the hero &apos;s presumed burial mound in the T@@ road .
later atte@@ stations point to an &quot; Ach@@ í@@ l@@ le@@ ion &quot; in Mess@@ enia and an &quot; Ach@@ í@@ l@@ le@@ ios &quot; in Lac@@ onia .
Nicol@@ ae Den@@ su@@ ş@@ i@@ anu recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of Aqu@@ il@@ e@@ ia and of the northern arm of the Danube delta , called Chil@@ ia , though his conclusion , that Le@@ uce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea , ev@@ okes modern rather than archaic sea @-@ law .
the kings of E@@ pir@@ us claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son , Ne@@ op@@ tol@@ em@@ us .
Alexander the Great , son of the E@@ pi@@ rote princess Olymp@@ ias , could therefore also claim this descent , and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor .
he is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achil@@ le@@ ion while passing Troy .
in AD 216 the Roman Emperor Carac@@ alla , while on his way to war against Par@@ thia , emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles &apos; tum@@ ulus .

the Greek trage@@ dian Aes@@ ch@@ yl@@ us wrote a tril@@ ogy of plays about Achilles , given the title &quot; Achil@@ le@@ is &quot; by modern scholars .
the tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War , including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punc@@ tures his heel .
extant fragments of the &quot; Achil@@ le@@ is &quot; and other Aes@@ chy@@ lean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play .
the first part of the &quot; Achil@@ le@@ is &quot; tril@@ ogy , &quot; The My@@ r@@ mid@@ ons &quot; , focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus , who represent the Ac@@ ha@@ ean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Ag@@ am@@ em@@ non ; only a few lines survive today .
in Plato &apos;s &quot; Symposium &quot; , P@@ ha@@ ed@@ rus points out that Aes@@ ch@@ yl@@ us portrayed Achilles as the lover and Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us as the beloved ;
P@@ ha@@ ed@@ rus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles , being the younger and more beautiful of the two , was the beloved , who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him .
the trage@@ dian Sop@@ ho@@ cles also wrote &quot; The L@@ overs of Achilles &quot; , a play with Achilles as the main character .
only a few fragments survive .
towards the end of the 5th century BC , a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama ;
E@@ uri@@ p@@ ides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in &quot; H@@ ecu@@ ba &quot; , &quot; Electr@@ a &quot; , and &quot; I@@ ph@@ ig@@ enia in A@@ ul@@ is &quot; .
</p>
<p>
the philosopher Z@@ eno of Ele@@ a centred one of his paradox@@ es on an imaginary foot@@ race between &quot; swift @-@ footed &quot; Achilles and a tortoise , by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start , and therefore that motion and change were impossible .
as a student of the mon@@ ist Par@@ men@@ ides and a member of the Ele@@ atic school , Z@@ eno believed time and motion to be illusions .
</p>
<p>
the Romans , who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy , took a highly negative view of Achilles .
Virg@@ il refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men , while Hor@@ ace portrays Achilles ruthlessly sla@@ ying women and children .
other writers , such as Cat@@ ul@@ l@@ us , Proper@@ tius , and O@@ vid , represent a second strand of dispar@@ agement , with an emphasis on Achilles &apos; erotic career .
this strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dic@@ t@@ ys Cre@@ ten@@ sis and Da@@ res Ph@@ ry@@ gi@@ us and in Ben@@ o@@ î@@ t de Sain@@ te @-@ Ma@@ ure &apos;s &quot; Roman de Tro@@ ie &quot; and Guid@@ o del@@ le Col@@ onne &apos;s &quot; Hist@@ oria destruc@@ tion@@ is Tro@@ i@@ ae &quot; , which remained the most widely read and ret@@ old versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century .
Achilles was described by the Byzantine chron@@ ic@@ ler Leo the De@@ acon , not as Hell@@ ene , but as Scy@@ th@@ ian , while according to the Byzantine author John Mal@@ alas , his army was made up of a tribe previously known as My@@ r@@ mid@@ ons and later as Bulg@@ ars .

<p>
Achilles has been frequently the subject of operas , bal@@ lets and related genres .
</p>
<p>
in 1890 , Elisabeth of Bav@@ aria , Em@@ press of Austria , had a summer palace built in Cor@@ fu .
the building is named the &quot; Achil@@ le@@ ion &quot; , after Achilles .
its paintings and statu@@ ary depict scenes from the Trojan War , with particular focus on Achilles .

Aristotle was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of St@@ ag@@ ira , Ch@@ alk@@ idi@@ ki , Greece .
along with Plato , he is considered the &quot; Father of Western Philosophy . &quot; Aristotle provided a complex and harmonious synthesis of the various existing philosophies prior to him , including those of Socrates and Plato , and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its fundamental intellectual lexicon , as well as problems and methods of inquiry .
as a result , his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be central to the contemporary philosophical discussion .
little is known about his life .
his father , Nic@@ om@@ ach@@ us , died when Aristotle was a child , and he was brought up by a guardian .
at seventeen or eighteen years of age , he joined Plato &apos;s Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty @-@ seven .
his writings cover many subjects - including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theatre , music , rhetoric , psychology , linguistics , economics , politics and government - and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy .
shortly after Plato died , Aristotle left Athens and , at the request of Philip II of Mac@@ ed@@ on , tutor@@ ed Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC .
teaching Alexander gave Aristotle many opportunities .
he established a library in the Ly@@ ce@@ um which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books , which were pap@@ y@@ rus sc@@ rolls .
the fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Plat@@ onism , but , following Plato &apos;s death , Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Plat@@ onism to empir@@ icism .
he believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on perception .
Aristotle &apos;s views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works .
Aristotle &apos;s views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship .
their influence extended from Late Anti@@ quity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics .
some of Aristotle &apos;s zo@@ ological observations , such as on the hec@@ toc@@ ot@@ yl arm of the octopus , were dis@@ believed until the 19th century .
his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abel@@ ard and John Bu@@ rid@@ an .
Aristot@@ eli@@ anism profoundly influenced Islamic thought during the Middle Ages , as well as Christian theology , especially the Ne@@ o@@ plat@@ onism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church .
Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as &quot; The First Teacher . &quot; his ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics .
all aspects of Aristotle &apos;s philosophy continue to be the object of academic study .
though Aristotle wrote many elegant treati@@ ses and dialogues for publication , only around a third of his original output has survived , none of it intended for publication .
Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including Rap@@ hael and R@@ emb@@ ran@@ dt .
early Modern theories including William Harvey &apos;s circulation of the blood and Galileo Galil@@ ei &apos;s kinematics were developed in reaction to Aristotle &apos;s .
in the 19th century , George Bo@@ ole gave Aristotle &apos;s logic a mathematical foundation with his system of algebraic logic .
in the 20th century , Martin Hei@@ deg@@ ger created a new interpretation of Aristotle &apos;s political philosophy , but elsewhere Aristotle was widely criticised , even ridicul@@ ed by thinkers such as the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the biologist Peter Med@@ aw@@ ar .
more recently , Aristotle has again been taken seriously , such as in the thinking of Ayn Rand and Alas@@ da@@ ir Mac@@ Int@@ y@@ re , while Armand Marie L@@ ero@@ i has reconstructed Aristotle &apos;s biology .
the image of Aristotle tutoring the young Alexander remains current , and the &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics &quot; continues to play a role in the cinema of the United States .
</p>
<p>
in general , the details of Aristotle &apos;s life are not well @-@ established .
the bi@@ ographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points .
Aristotle , whose name means &quot; the best purpose &quot; in Ancient Greek , was born in 384 BC in St@@ ag@@ ira , Chal@@ ci@@ dice , about 55 km east of modern @-@ day Thessaloniki .
his father Nic@@ om@@ ach@@ us was the personal physician to King A@@ my@@ n@@ tas of Mac@@ ed@@ on .
both of Aristotle &apos;s parents died when he was about thirteen , and Pro@@ xen@@ us of A@@ tar@@ ne@@ us became his guardian .
although little information about Aristotle &apos;s childhood has survived , he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace , making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy .
at the age of seventeen or eighteen , Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato &apos;s Academy .
he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348 / 47 BC .
the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy &apos;s direction after control passed to Plato &apos;s nephew Spe@@ u@@ sip@@ pus , although it is possible that he feared the anti @-@ Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died .
Aristotle then accompanied X@@ en@@ oc@@ rates to the court of his friend Hermi@@ as of A@@ tar@@ ne@@ us in Asia Minor .
after the death of Hermi@@ as , Aristotle travelled with his pupil The@@ oph@@ ra@@ st@@ us to the island of Les@@ bos , where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon .
while in Les@@ bos , Aristotle married Py@@ thi@@ as , either Hermi@@ as &apos;s adoptive daughter or niece .
she bore him a daughter , whom they also named Py@@ thi@@ as .
in 343 BC , Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Mac@@ ed@@ on to become the tutor to his son Alexander .
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Mac@@ ed@@ on .
during Aristotle &apos;s time in the Macedonian court , he gave lessons not only to Alexander , but also to two other future kings : P@@ tol@@ emy and Cass@@ ander .
Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and Aristotle &apos;s own attitude towards Persia was un@@ ab@@ as@@ he@@ dly ethno@@ centric .
in one famous example , he counsels Alexander to be &quot; a leader to the Greeks and a des@@ pot to the barb@@ arians , to look after the former as after friends and relatives , and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants . &quot; by 335 BC , Aristotle had returned to Athens , establishing his own school there known as the Ly@@ ce@@ um .
Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years .
while in Athens , his wife Py@@ thi@@ as died and Aristotle became involved with Her@@ pyl@@ lis of St@@ ag@@ ira , who bore him a son whom he named after his father , Nic@@ om@@ ach@@ us .
according to the &quot; Sud@@ a &quot; , he also had an &quot; er@@ ô@@ men@@ os &quot; , Pal@@ a@@ eph@@ atus of Ab@@ y@@ dus .
this period in Athens , between 335 and 323 BC , is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works .
he wrote many dialogues , of which only fragments have survived .
those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not , for the most part , intended for widespread publication ; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students .
his most important treati@@ ses include &quot; Physics &quot; , &quot; Met@@ aph@@ ysics &quot; , &quot; Nic@@ om@@ ac@@ he@@ an Ethics &quot; , &quot; Politics &quot; , &quot; On the Soul &quot; and &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics &quot; .
Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to &quot; logic , metaphysics , mathematics , physics , biology , botany , ethics , politics , agriculture , medicine , dance and theatre . &quot; near the end of his life , Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander &apos;s relationship with Persia and Per@@ sians .
a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander &apos;s death , but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death .
following Alexander &apos;s death , anti @-@ Macedonian sentiment in Athens was re@@ kindled .
in 322 BC , Dem@@ ophil@@ us and Eur@@ y@@ me@@ don the Hi@@ er@@ oph@@ ant reportedly denounced Aristotle for imp@@ i@@ ety , prompting him to flee to his mother &apos;s family estate in Chal@@ cis , on Eu@@ bo@@ ea , at which occasion he was said to have stated :
&quot; I will not allow the Ath@@ en@@ ians to sin twice against philosophy &quot; - a reference to Athens &apos;s trial and execution of Socrates .
he died on Eu@@ bo@@ ea of natural causes later that same year , having named his student Anti@@ p@@ ater as his chief execu@@ tor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife .
</p>
<p>
with the &quot; Prior Analy@@ tics &quot; , Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic , and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th @-@ century advances in mathematical logic .
Kant stated in the &quot; Cri@@ tique of Pure Reason &quot; that with Aristotle logic reached its completion .
</p>
<p>
what we today call &quot; Aristot@@ el@@ ian logic &quot; with its types of syl@@ log@@ ism , Aristotle himself would have labelled &quot; analytics . &quot; the term &quot; logic &quot; he reserved to mean &quot; dialec@@ tics &quot; .
most of Aristotle &apos;s work is probably not in its original form , because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers .
the logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the &quot; Organ@@ on &quot; around 40 BC by And@@ ron@@ icus of Rhodes or others among his followers .
the books are : # &quot; Categories &quot; # &quot; On Interpretation &quot; # &quot; Prior Analy@@ tics &quot; # &quot; Po@@ ster@@ ior Analy@@ tics &quot; # &quot; Top@@ ics &quot; # &quot; On S@@ oph@@ is@@ tical Refu@@ tations &quot; The order of the books is not certain , but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle &apos;s writings .
it goes from the basics , the analysis of simple terms in the &quot; Categories , &quot; the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in &quot; On Interpretation &quot; , to the study of more complex forms , namely , syl@@ log@@ isms and dialec@@ tics .
the first three treati@@ ses form the core of the logical theory &quot; stric@@ to sen@@ su &quot; : the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning .
the &quot; Rhe@@ tor@@ ic &quot; is not conventionally included , but it states that it relies on the &quot; Top@@ ics &quot; .
</p>
<p>
like his teacher Plato , Aristotle &apos;s philosophy aims at the universal .
Aristotle &apos;s ontology places the universal in particulars , things in the world , whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate .
this means that Aristotle &apos;s epistem@@ ology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world , and rises to knowledge of the universal , whereas for Plato epistem@@ ology begins with knowledge of universal Forms and descends to knowledge of particular im@@ itations of these .
for Aristotle , &quot; form &quot; is still what phenomena are based on , but is &quot; instan@@ ti@@ ated &quot; in a particular substance .
Aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction , whereas Plato relies on deduction from &quot; a priori &quot; principles .
in Aristotle &apos;s terminology , &quot; natural philosophy &quot; is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world , and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics , biology and other natural sciences .
Aristotle &apos;s work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry .
Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense co@@ extensive with reasoning , which he also would describe as &quot; science . &quot; note , however , that his use of the term &quot; science &quot; carries a different meaning than that covered by the term &quot; scientific method . &quot; for Aristotle , &quot; all science is either practical , poe@@ tical or theoretical &quot; .
his practical science includes ethics and politics ; his poe@@ tical science means the study of fine arts including poetry ; his theoretical science covers physics , mathematics and metaphysics .
</p>
<p>
the word &quot; metaphysics &quot; appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle &apos;s works to the treatise we know by the name &quot; Met@@ aph@@ ysics &quot; .
Aristotle called it &quot; first philosophy , &quot; and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science as the contempl@@ ative philosophy which is &quot; theological &quot; and studies the divine .
he wrote in his &quot; Met@@ aph@@ ysics &quot; : if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones , the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge ; but if there is some motionless independent thing , the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy , and it is universal &quot; in just this way &quot; , because it is first .
and it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being , both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle examines the concepts of substance and essence in his &quot; Met@@ aph@@ ysics &quot; , and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form , a philosophical theory called hy@@ l@@ omorph@@ ism .
in Book VIII , he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substr@@ atum , or the stuff of which it is composed .
for example , the matter of a house is the bricks , stones , tim@@ bers etc . , or whatever constitutes the &quot; potential &quot; house , while the form of the substance is the &quot; actual &quot; house , namely &apos; covering for bodies and ch@@ att@@ els &apos; or any other differenti@@ a that let us define something as a house .
the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter , and the formula that gives the differenti@@ a is the account of the form .
with regard to the change and its causes now , as he defines in his &quot; Physics &quot; and &quot; On Generation and Corruption &quot; 3@@ 19@@ b @-@ 3@@ 20@@ a , he distinguishes the coming to be from :
# growth and diminution , which is change in quantity ; # locom@@ otion , which is change in space ; and # alteration , which is change in quality .
the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property .
in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality and actuality in association with the matter and the form .
referring to potentiality , this is what a thing is capable of doing , or being acted upon , if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else .
for example , the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially plant , and if it is not prevented by something , it will become a plant .
for example , the eyes possess the potentiality of sight , while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning .
actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality .
because the end is the principle of every change , and for the sake of the end exists potentiality , therefore actuality is the end .
referring then to our previous example , we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do .
for that for the sake of which a thing is , is its principle , and the becoming is for the sake of the end ; and the actuality is the end , and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired .
for animals do not see in order that they may have sight , but they have sight that they may see .
in summary , the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actu@@ alities , which is also a final cause or end .
then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula , in time and in substanti@@ ality .
with this definition of the particular substance , Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings , for example , &quot; what is it that makes a man one &quot; ?
since , according to Plato there are two Ideas : animal and bi@@ ped , how then is man a unity ?
however , according to Aristotle , the potential being and the actual one are one and the same .
</p>
<p>
Plato argued that all things have a universal form , which could be either a property or a relation to other things .
when we look at an apple , for example , we see an apple , and we can also analyse a form of an apple .
in this distinction , there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple .
moreover , we can place an apple next to a book , so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other .
Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things .
for example , it is possible that there is no particular good in existence , but &quot; good &quot; is still a proper universal form .
Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point , arguing that all univers@@ als are instan@@ ti@@ ated at some period of time , and that there are no univers@@ als that are un@@ attached to existing things .
in addition , Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of univers@@ als .
where Plato spoke of the world of forms , a place where all universal forms subsist , Aristotle maintained that univers@@ als exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated .
so , according to Aristotle , the form of apple exists within each apple , rather than in the world of the forms .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle &apos;s &quot; natural philosophy &quot; spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics , biology and other natural sciences .
</p>
<p>
in his &quot; On Generation and Corruption &quot; , Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Em@@ pe@@ do@@ cles , Earth , Water , Air , and Fire , to two of the four sensible qualities , hot , cold , wet , and dry .
in the Em@@ pe@@ do@@ clean scheme , all matter was made of the four elements , in differing proportions .
Aristotle &apos;s scheme added the heavenly A@@ ether , the divine substance of the heavenly spheres , stars and planets .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle describes two kinds of motion : &quot; violent &quot; or &quot; unnatural motion , &quot; such as that of a thrown stone , in the &quot; Physics &quot; , and &quot; natural motion , &quot; such as of a falling object , in &quot; On the Heaven@@ s &quot; .
in violent motion , as soon as the agent stops causing it , the motion stops also ; in other words , the natural state of an object is to be at rest , since Aristotle does not address friction .
with this understanding , it can be observed that , as Aristotle stated , heavy objects require more force to make them move ; and objects pushed with greater force move faster .
this would imply the equation : : F = m@@ v , incorrect in modern physics .
natural motion depends on the element concerned : the a@@ ether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens , while the 4 Em@@ pe@@ do@@ clean elements move vertically up or down towards their natural resting places .
in the &quot; Physics &quot; , Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law , that the speed , v , of a falling body is proportional to its weight , W , and inversely proportional to the density , ρ , of the fluid in which it is falling : : : V = c \ frac Aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite , and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible .
opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws .
Henri Car@@ ter@@ on held the &quot; extreme view &quot; that Aristotle &apos;s concept of force was basically qualitative , but other authors reject this .
Arch@@ im@@ edes corrected Aristotle &apos;s theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places ; metal boats can float if they displace enough water ; floating depends in Arch@@ im@@ edes &apos; scheme on the mass and volume of the object , not as Aristotle thought its elementary composition .
Aristotle &apos;s writings on motion remained influential until the Early Modern period .
John Phil@@ op@@ onus and Galileo are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle &apos;s claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect .
a contrary opinion is given by Carlo R@@ ov@@ elli , who argues that Aristotle &apos;s physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity , that of objects in the Earth &apos;s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air .
in this system , heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones , and they do fall more slowly in a dens@@ er medium .
Newton &apos;s &quot; forced &quot; motion corresponds to Aristotle &apos;s &quot; violent &quot; motion with its external agent , but Aristotle &apos;s assumption that the agent &apos;s effect stops immediately it stops acting has awkward consequences : he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it , resulting in the Medi@@ eval theory of impetus .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors .
his term &quot; a@@ iti@@ a &quot; is traditionally translated as &quot; cause , &quot; but it does not always refer to temporal sequence ; it might be better translated as &quot; explanation , &quot; but the traditional rendering will be employed here .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obs@@ cur@@ a in &quot; Problems &quot; , book 15 .
the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in .
with it , he saw that whatever shape he made the hole , the sun &apos;s image always remained circular .
he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image .
</p>
<p>
according to Aristotle , spontan@@ eity and chance are causes of some things , distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity .
chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things , &quot; from what is spontaneous . &quot; there is also more a specific kind of chance , which Aristotle names &quot; luck , &quot; that only applies to people &apos;s moral choices .
</p>
<p>
in astronomy , Aristotle refuted Dem@@ oc@@ rit@@ us &apos;s claim that the Milky Way was made up of &quot; those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun &apos;s rays , &quot; pointing out correctly that if &quot; the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun , then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations .
he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person &apos;s lifetime .
the geologist Charles Ly@@ ell noted that Aristotle described such change , including &quot; lakes that had dried up &quot; and &quot; deserts that had become watered by rivers , &quot; giving as examples the growth of the Nile delta since the time of Homer , and &quot; the up@@ he@@ aving of one of the A@@ e@@ ol@@ ian islands , previous to a volcanic eruption . &quot; &apos;
</p>
<p>
Aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically , and biology forms a large part of his writings .
he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of Les@@ bos and the surrounding seas , including in particular the Py@@ r@@ r@@ ha lagoon in the centre of Les@@ bos .
his data in &quot; History of Animals &quot; , &quot; Generation of Animals &quot; , &quot; Movement of Animals &quot; , and &quot; Parts of Animals &quot; are assembled from his own observations , statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as bee@@ keepers and fishermen , and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas .
his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident : his works on botany have been lost , but two books on plants by his pupil The@@ oph@@ ra@@ st@@ us have survived .
Aristotle reports on the sea @-@ life visible from observation on Les@@ bos and the catches of fishermen .
he describes the cat@@ fish , electric ray , and fro@@ g@@ fish in detail , as well as cephal@@ o@@ pods such as the octopus and paper nau@@ til@@ us .
his description of the hec@@ toc@@ ot@@ yl arm of cephal@@ o@@ pods , used in sexual reproduction , was widely dis@@ believed until the 19th century .
he gives accurate descriptions of the four @-@ cham@@ bered fore @-@ stom@@ achs of r@@ umin@@ ants , and of the ov@@ o@@ vivi@@ par@@ ous embry@@ ological development of the hound shark .
he notes that an animal &apos;s structure is well matched to function , so , among birds , the her@@ on , which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish , has a long neck and long legs , and a sharp spear @-@ like beak , whereas ducks that swim have short legs and web@@ bed feet .
Darwin , too , noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal , but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution .
Aristotle &apos;s writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution , but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybri@@ dis@@ ations could occur , he saw these as rare accidents .
for Aristotle , accidents , like heat waves in winter , must be considered distinct from natural causes .
he was thus critical of Em@@ pe@@ do@@ cles &apos;s materi@@ alist theory of a &quot; survival of the fit@@ test &quot; origin of living things and their organs , and ridicul@@ ed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results .
to put his views into modern terms , he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor , or that one kind can change into another , or that kinds can become extinct .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense .
he used the ancient Greek term &quot; pe@@ pe@@ ira@@ men@@ oi &quot; to mean observations , or at most investigative procedures like dissection .
in &quot; Generation of Animals &quot; , he finds a fertil@@ ised hen &apos;s egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo &apos;s heart beating inside .
instead , he practised a different style of science : systematically gathering data , discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals , and infer@@ ring possible causal explanations from these .
this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field , such as genomics .
it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science , but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed .
in this sense , Aristotle &apos;s biology is scientific .
from the data he collected and documented , Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life @-@ history features of the live @-@ bearing tetra@@ pods that he studied .
among these correct predictions are the following .
brood size decreases with body mass , so that an elephant has fewer young per brood than a mouse .
lifespan increases with gestation period , and also with body mass , so that elephants live longer than mice , have a longer period of gestation , and are heavier .
as a final example , fec@@ und@@ ity decreases with lifespan , so long @-@ lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short @-@ lived kinds like mice .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals , arranging these in the &quot; History of Animals &quot; in a graded scale of perfection , a &quot; sc@@ ala nat@@ u@@ ra@@ e &quot; , with man at the top .
his system had eleven grades of animal , from highest potential to lowest , expressed in their form at birth : the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures , the lowest laid cold , dry mineral @-@ like eggs .
animals came above plants , and these in turn were above miner@@ al@@ s. see also :
he grouped what the modern zo@@ ologist would call vertebrates as the hotter &quot; animals with blood , &quot; and below them the colder invertebrates as &quot; animals without blood . &quot; those with blood were divided into the live @-@ bearing , and the egg @-@ laying .
those without blood were insects , crust@@ acea and the hard @-@ shelled mol@@ lus@@ cs .
he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale , and noted various exceptions , such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetra@@ pods .
to a modern biologist , the explanation , not available to Aristotle , is convergent evolution .
he believed that pur@@ po@@ sive final causes guided all natural processes ; this tele@@ ological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design .

Aristotle &apos;s psychology , given in his treatise &quot; On the Soul &quot; , pos@@ its three kinds of soul : the vegetative soul , the sensitive soul , and the rational soul .
humans have a rational soul .
the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds :
like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself ; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally .
the unique part of the human , rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the &quot; nous &quot; and &quot; logos &quot; .
for Aristotle , the soul is the form of a living being .
because all beings are composites of form and matter , the form of living beings is that which end@@ ows them with what is specific to living beings , e.g. the ability to initiate movement .
in contrast to earlier philosophers , but in accordance with the Egyptians , he placed the rational soul in the heart , rather than the brain .
notable is Aristotle &apos;s division of sensation and thought , which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers , with the exception of Al@@ c@@ ma@@ eon .
</p>
<p>
according to Aristotle in &quot; On the Soul &quot; , memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal &quot; appearance &quot; and an occurrence in the past .
in other words , a memory is a mental picture that can be recovered .
Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi @-@ fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory .
a memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once .
these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation , Aristot@@ el@@ ian &apos; common sense &apos; , and thinking .
Aristotle uses the term &apos; memory &apos; for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation , and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents .
memory is of the past , prediction is of the future , and sensation is of the present .
retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly .
a transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences , both for our previous experience and present experience .
because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions , people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences .
to search for these impressions , people search the memory itself .
within the memory , if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory , that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for .
recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another .
if the chain of &quot; images &quot; is needed , one memory will stimulate the next .
when people recall experiences , they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed .
recollection is thus the self @-@ directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression .
only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity , such as numbers and words .
animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations .
remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed .
Aristotle believed the chain of thought , which ends in recollection of certain impressions , was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity , contrast , and contiguity , described in his Laws of Association .
Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind .
a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience .
according to Aristotle , association is the power innate in a mental state , which operates upon the un@@ expressed remains of former experiences , allowing them to rise and be recalled .

Aristotle describes sleep in &quot; On Sleep and W@@ ak@@ efulness &quot; .
sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion , so it is vital to the body .
while a person is asleep , the critical activities , which include thinking , sensing , recalling and remembering , do not function as they do during wak@@ efulness .
since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire , which is the result of sensation .
however , the senses are able to work during sleep , albeit differently , unless they are weary .
dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus .
in dreams , sensation is still involved , but in an altered manner .
Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water , and then look away , the next thing they look at appears to have a wav@@ eli@@ ke motion .
when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention , it leaves an impression .
when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly , a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored .
however , during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences .
so , dreams result from these lasting impressions .
since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli , dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience .
during sleep , a person is in an altered state of mind .
Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus .
for example , a person who has a strong infat@@ uation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings .
since a person sleeping is in a sugg@@ estible state and unable to make judgements , they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams , like the infat@@ uated person .
this leads the person to believe the dream is real , even when the dreams are absurd in nature .
one component of Aristotle &apos;s theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs .
he claimed that dreams are not foret@@ elling and not sent by a divine being .
Aristotle reasoned natur@@ al@@ istically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply co@@ incidences .
Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it .
if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred .
secondly , any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream .
for example , if , while a person is sleeping , a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut , this sensory experience is not part of the dream .
lastly , the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences .

Aristotle &apos;s practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics , politics , economics , and rhetoric .
</p>
<p>
Aristot@@ el@@ ian just war theory is not well regarded in the present day , especially his view that warfare was justified to ens@@ al@@ ve &quot; natural slaves . &quot; in Aristot@@ el@@ ian philosophy , the abolition of what he considers &quot; natural slavery &quot; would undermine civic freedom .
the pu@@ suit of freedom is in@@ seper@@ able from pursuing mastery over &quot; those who deserve to be slaves . &quot; according to &quot; The Cambridge Compan@@ ion to Aristotle &apos;s Politics &quot; the targets of this ag@@ gre@@ sive warfare were non @-@ Greeks , noting Aristotle &apos;s view that &quot; our poets say &apos; it is proper for Greeks to rule non @-@ Greeks &apos; . &quot; Aristotle generally has a favorable opinion of war , ex@@ tol@@ ling it as a chance for virtue and writing that &quot; the leisure that accompanies peace &quot; tends to make people &quot; arrogant . &quot; war to &quot; avoid becoming enslaved to others &quot; is justified as self @-@ defense .
he writes that war &quot; compels people to be just and temperate , &quot; however , in order to be just &quot; war must be chosen for the sake of peace &quot; .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study , i.e. , one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake .
he wrote several treati@@ ses on ethics , including most notably , the &quot; Nic@@ om@@ ac@@ he@@ an Ethics &quot; .
Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function of a thing .
an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see , because the proper function of an eye is sight .
Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans , and that this function must be an activity of the &quot; p@@ su@@ ch@@ ē &quot; in accordance with reason .
Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action , &quot; e@@ ud@@ aim@@ onia &quot; , generally translated as &quot; happiness &quot; or sometimes &quot; well being . &quot; to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character , often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence .
Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habit@@ uated not deliberately , but by teachers , and experience , leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things .
when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom and their intellect can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue , the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker , or in other words , a philosopher .
</p>
<p>
in addition to his works on ethics , which address the individual , Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled &quot; Politics &quot; .
Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community .
moreover , he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual , &quot; for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part . &quot; he also famously stated that &quot; man is by nature a political animal &quot; and also arguing that humanity &apos;s defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality .
Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine , and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others .
Aristotle &apos;s conception of the city is organic , and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner .
the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle &apos;s understanding .
although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires , the natural community according to Aristotle was the city which functions as a political &quot; community &quot; or &quot; partnership &quot; .
the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life , and to perform beautiful acts :
&quot; the political partnership must be regarded , therefore , as being for the sake of noble actions , not for the sake of living together . &quot; this is distinguished from modern approaches , beginning with social contract theory , according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of &quot; fear of violent death &quot; or its &quot; in@@ conveniences . &quot; in &quot; Pro@@ tre@@ p@@ tic@@ us &quot; , the character &apos; Aristotle &apos; states :
for we all agree that the most excellent man should rule , i.e. , the supreme by nature , and that the law rules and alone is authoritative ; but the law is a kind of intelligence , i.e. a discourse based on intelligence .
and again , what standard do we have , what criterion of good things , that is more precise than the intelligent man ?
for all that this man will choose , if the choice is based on his knowledge , are good things and their contr@@ aries are bad .
and since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions , it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent ; for this is the function of that capacity .
hence it &apos;s evident that , according to the most authoritative judgment , intelligence is supreme among goods .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought , especially to thought in the Middle Ages .
in &quot; Politics &quot; , Aristotle addresses the city , property , and trade .
his response to criticisms of private property , in Lionel Rob@@ bins &apos;s view , anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists , as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements .
Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society , and that although private property is often blamed for social strife , such evils in fact come from human nature .
in &quot; Politics &quot; , Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money .
money came into use because people became dependent on one another , importing what they needed and exporting the surplus .
for the sake of convenience , people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable , such as iron or silver .
Aristotle &apos;s discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages .
he had a low opinion of retail , believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household , retail trade seeks to make a profit .
it thus uses goods as a means to an end , rather than as an end unto itself .
he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural .
similarly , Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural , as it makes a gain out of the money itself , and not from its use .
Aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably pre@@ co@@ cious for his time .
he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth , the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement .
money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them &quot; commen@@ su@@ rable . &quot; he goes to on state that money is also useful for future exchange , making it a sort of security .
that is , &quot; if we do not want a thing now , we shall be able to get it when we do want it . &quot;

Aristotle &apos;s &quot; Rhe@@ tor@@ ic &quot; proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience :
&quot; ethos &quot; , &quot; patho@@ s &quot; , and &quot; logos &quot; .
he also categor@@ ises rhetoric into three genres : ep@@ ide@@ ic@@ tic , forensic , and deliberative .
Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs : &quot; en@@ thy@@ mem@@ e &quot; and &quot; parad@@ eig@@ ma &quot; .
Aristotle writes in his &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics &quot; that epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , di@@ thy@@ ra@@ mb@@ ic poetry , painting , sculpture , music , and dance are all fundamentally acts of &quot; mim@@ e@@ sis &quot; , each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner .
he applies the term &quot; mim@@ e@@ sis &quot; both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist &apos;s intention and contends that the audience &apos;s realisation of the &quot; mim@@ e@@ sis &quot; is vital to understanding the work itself .
Aristotle states that &quot; mim@@ e@@ sis &quot; is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human arti@@ stry &quot; follows the pattern of nature . &quot; because of this , Aristotle believed that each of the mim@@ etic arts possesses what Stephen Halli@@ well calls &quot; highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes . &quot; for example , music im@@ itates with the media of rhythm and harmony , whereas dance im@@ itates with rhythm alone , and poetry with language .
the forms also differ in their object of imitation .
comedy , for instance , is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy im@@ itates men slightly better than average .
lastly , the forms differ in their manner of imitation - through narrative or character , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama .
while it is believed that Aristotle &apos;s &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics &quot; originally comprised two books - one on comedy and one on tragedy - only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived .
Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements : plot @-@ structure , character , style , thought , spectacle , and lyric poetry .
the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story ; and the plot , not the characters , is the chief focus of tragedy .
tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear , and is meant to effect the ca@@ thar@@ sis of those same emotions .
Aristotle concludes &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics &quot; with a discussion on which , if either , is superior : epic or tragic mim@@ e@@ sis .
he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic , possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music , is more unified , and achieves the aim of its mim@@ e@@ sis in shorter scope , it can be considered superior to epic .
Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of rid@@ dles , folklore , and proverbs ; he and his school had a special interest in the rid@@ dles of the Del@@ phic Oracle and studied the f@@ ables of Aes@@ op .
</p>
<p>
Aristotle &apos;s analysis of procreation describes an active , ens@@ ou@@ ling masculine element bringing life to an inert , passive female element .
on this ground , proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of mis@@ og@@ y@@ ny and sexism .
however , Aristotle gave equal weight to women &apos;s happiness as he did to men &apos;s , and commented in his &quot; Rhe@@ tor@@ ic &quot; that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men .
</p>
<p>
more than 2300 years after his death , Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived .
he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence , and he was the founder of many new fields .
according to the philosopher Bryan Mag@@ ee , &quot; it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did . &quot; among countless other achievements , Aristotle was the founder of formal logic , pioneered the study of zoology , and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method .
Tan@@ eli Ku@@ k@@ kon@@ en , writing in &quot; The Classical Tra@@ dition &quot; , observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched , and his reach in influencing &quot; every branch of intellectual enterprise &quot; including Western ethical and political theory , theology , rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long .
as a result , Ku@@ k@@ kon@@ en argues , any analysis of reality today &quot; will almost certainly carry Aristot@@ el@@ ian over@@ tones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind . &quot; Jonathan Bar@@ nes wrote that &quot; an account of Aristotle &apos;s intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Aristotle &apos;s pupil and successor , The@@ oph@@ ra@@ st@@ us , wrote the &quot; History of Plants &quot; , a pioneering work in botany .
some of his technical terms remain in use , such as car@@ p@@ el from &quot; car@@ pos &quot; , fruit , and peric@@ ar@@ p , from &quot; peric@@ ar@@ pi@@ on &quot; , seed chamber .
The@@ oph@@ ra@@ st@@ us was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was , instead pragm@@ atically describing how plants functioned .
</p>
<p>
the immediate influence of Aristotle &apos;s work was felt as the Ly@@ ce@@ um grew into the Per@@ ip@@ ate@@ tic school .
Aristotle &apos;s notable students included Arist@@ ox@@ en@@ us , Dic@@ a@@ ear@@ ch@@ us , Dem@@ e@@ tri@@ us of P@@ hal@@ er@@ um , E@@ ud@@ em@@ os of Rhodes , Har@@ pal@@ us , Hep@@ ha@@ estion , M@@ nas@@ on of Ph@@ oc@@ is , Nic@@ om@@ ach@@ us , and The@@ oph@@ ra@@ st@@ us .
Aristotle &apos;s influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter &apos;s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zo@@ ologists , bot@@ an@@ ists , and researchers .
he had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher .
although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle &apos;s geography was clearly wrong , when the old philosopher released his works to the public , Alexander complained &quot; Thou hast not done well to publish thy acro@@ am@@ atic doctrines ; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men &apos;s common property ? &quot;
</p>
<p>
after The@@ oph@@ ra@@ st@@ us , the Ly@@ ce@@ um failed to produce any original work .
though interest in Aristotle &apos;s ideas survived , they were generally taken unquestion@@ ingly .
it is not until the age of Alexandria under the P@@ tol@@ em@@ ies that advances in biology can be again found .
the first medical teacher at Alexandria , Her@@ ophil@@ us of Chal@@ ced@@ on , corrected Aristotle , placing intelligence in the brain , and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation .
Her@@ ophil@@ us also distinguished between veins and arteries , noting that the latter pulse while the former do not .
though a few ancient atom@@ ists such as Lu@@ cre@@ tius challenged the tele@@ ological viewpoint of Aristot@@ el@@ ian ideas about life , tele@@ ology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries .
Ernst May@@ r states that there was &quot; nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lu@@ cre@@ tius and Gal@@ en until the Renaissance . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus .
the first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Phil@@ op@@ onus , Elias , and David in the sixth century , and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century .
John Phil@@ op@@ onus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle &apos;s views on the eternity of the world , movement , and other elements of Aristot@@ el@@ ian thought .
Phil@@ op@@ onus questioned Aristotle &apos;s teaching of physics , noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations .
after a hiatus of several centuries , formal commentary by Eu@@ strati@@ us and Michael of Ep@@ he@@ sus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries , apparently sponsored by Anna Com@@ n@@ ena .

Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology .
most of the still extant works of Aristotle , as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries , were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers , scientists and scholars .
Aver@@ ro@@ es , A@@ vic@@ enna and Al@@ phar@@ ab@@ ius , who wrote on Aristotle in great depth , also influenced Thomas Aqu@@ inas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers .
Alk@@ indu@@ s greatly admired Aristotle &apos;s philosophy , and Aver@@ ro@@ es spoke of Aristotle as the &quot; exempl@@ ar &quot; for all future philosophers .
medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the &quot; First Teacher . &quot; the title &quot; teacher &quot; was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars , and was later used by Western philosophers who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy .
</p>
<p>
with the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West , Aristotle was practically unknown there from c .
ad 600 to c .
1100 except through the Latin translation of the &quot; Organ@@ on &quot; made by Bo@@ eth@@ ius .
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made , both from Arabic translations , such as those by Gerard of Cre@@ mon@@ a , and from the original Greek , such as those by James of Venice and William of Mo@@ er@@ be@@ ke .
after the Schol@@ astic Thomas Aqu@@ inas wrote his &quot; Sum@@ ma The@@ olog@@ ica &quot; , working from Mo@@ er@@ be@@ ke &apos;s translations and calling Aristotle &quot; The Philos@@ opher , &quot; the demand for Aristotle &apos;s writings grew , and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West , stimulating a revival of Aristot@@ eli@@ anism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance .
these thinkers blended Aristot@@ el@@ ian philosophy with Christianity , bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages .
scholars such as Bo@@ eth@@ ius , Peter Abel@@ ard , and John Bu@@ rid@@ an worked on Aristot@@ el@@ ian logic .
the medieval English poet Cha@@ uc@@ er describes his student as being happy by having at his bed@@ des heed Twenty boo@@ kes , clad in bl@@ ak or reed , Of arist@@ ot@@ le and his philos@@ op@@ hie , A cau@@ tionary medieval tale held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander to avoid the king &apos;s seductive mistress , Phy@@ l@@ lis , but was himself captiv@@ ated by her , and allowed her to ride him .
Phy@@ l@@ lis had secretly told Alexander what to expect , and he witnessed Phy@@ l@@ lis proving that a woman &apos;s charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher &apos;s male intellect .
artists such as Hans Bal@@ dung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme .
</p>
<p>
in the Early Modern period , scientists such as William Harvey in England and Galileo Galil@@ ei in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Gal@@ en , establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment .
Harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood , establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body &apos;s heat , as Aristotle thought .
Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle &apos;s physics , proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight .

<p>
the 19th @-@ century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle .
Aristotle rigidly separated action from production , and argued for the deserved subservi@@ ence of some people , and the natural superiority of others .
it was Martin Hei@@ deg@@ ger , not Nietzsche , who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle , intended to warrant his decon@@ struction of scholastic and philosophical tradition .
the English mathematician George Bo@@ ole fully accepted Aristotle &apos;s logic , but decided &quot; to go under , over , and beyond &quot; it with his system of algebraic logic in his 18@@ 54 book &quot; The Laws of Thought &quot; .
this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations , enables it to solve equations as well as check validity , and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms , not just two .
</p>
<p>
during the 20th century , Aristotle &apos;s work was widely criticised .
the philosopher Bertrand Russell argued that &quot; almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristot@@ el@@ ian doctrine . &quot; Russell called Aristotle &apos;s ethics &quot; repulsive , &quot; and labelled his logic &quot; as definitely antiquated as P@@ tol@@ em@@ a@@ ic astronomy . &quot; Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle , until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors .
the Dutch historian of science Edu@@ ard Jan Di@@ j@@ k@@ ster@@ hu@@ is wrote that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by &quot; proceed &#91; ing &#93; so readily to frame a theory of such a general character &quot; on limited evidence from their senses .
in 1985 , the biologist Peter Med@@ aw@@ ar could still state in &quot; pure seventeenth century &quot; tones that Aristotle had assembled &quot; a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome far@@ ra@@ go of hearsay , imperfect observation , wishful thinking and cred@@ ul@@ ity amounting to downright gul@@ li@@ bility . &quot; by the start of the 21st century , however , Aristotle was taken more seriously :
Ku@@ k@@ kon@@ en noted that &quot; In the best 20th @-@ century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition . &quot; Ayn Rand accredited Aristotle as &quot; the greatest philosopher in history &quot; and cited him as a major influence on her thinking .
more recently , Alas@@ da@@ ir Mac@@ Int@@ y@@ re has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristot@@ el@@ ian tradition in a way that is anti @-@ eliti@@ st and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietz@@ sch@@ eans .
Ku@@ k@@ kon@@ en observed , too , that &quot; that most enduring of romantic images , Aristotle tutoring the future conquer@@ or Alexander &quot; remained current , as in the 2004 film &quot; Alexander &quot; , while the &quot; firm rules &quot; of Aristotle &apos;s theory of drama have ensured a role for the &quot; Po@@ e@@ tics &quot; in Hollywood .
biologists continue to be interested in Aristotle &apos;s thinking .
Armand Marie L@@ ero@@ i has reconstructed Aristotle &apos;s biology , while Nik@@ o Tin@@ ber@@ gen &apos;s four questions , based on Aristotle &apos;s four causes , are used to analyse animal behaviour ; they examine function , phy@@ lo@@ geny , mechanism , and on@@ to@@ geny .

the works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Cor@@ pus Aristot@@ elic@@ um .
these texts , as opposed to Aristotle &apos;s lost works , are technical philosophical treati@@ ses from within Aristotle &apos;s school .
reference to them is made according to the organisation of Im@@ manuel Bek@@ ker &apos;s Royal Pr@@ ussian Academy edition , which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works .

Aristotle wrote his works on pap@@ y@@ rus sc@@ rolls , the common writing medium of that era .
his writings are divi@@ sible into two groups : the &quot; exo@@ teric , &quot; intended for the public , and the &quot; esoteric , &quot; for use within the Ly@@ ce@@ um school .
Aristotle &apos;s &quot; lost &quot; works stray considerably in character@@ isation from the surviving Aristot@@ el@@ ian corpus .
whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication , the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication .
Cic@@ ero &apos;s description of Aristotle &apos;s literary style as &quot; a river of gold &quot; must have applied to the published works , not the surviving notes .
a major question in the history of Aristotle &apos;s works is how the exo@@ teric writings were all lost , and how the ones we now possess came to us .
the consensus is that And@@ ron@@ icus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle &apos;s school which existed in the form of smaller , separate works , distinguished them from those of The@@ oph@@ ra@@ st@@ us and other Per@@ ip@@ ate@@ tics , edited them , and finally compiled them into the more cohesive , larger works as they are known today .

Ayn Rand was a Russian @-@ American writer and philosopher .
she is known for her two best @-@ selling novels , &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; and &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; , and for developing a philosophical system she named Objec@@ tivism .
educated in Russia , she moved to the United States in 1926 .
she had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 and 1936 .
after two early novels that were initially unsuccessful , she achieved fame with her 1943 novel , &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; .
in 1957 , Rand published her best @-@ known work , the novel &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; .
afterward , she turned to non @-@ fiction to promote her philosophy , publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982 .
Rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion .
she supported rational and ethical ego@@ ism and rejected altruism .
in politics , she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collec@@ tivism and statis@@ m as well as anarch@@ ism , instead supporting &quot; laissez @-@ faire &quot; capitalism , which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights , including property rights .
in art , Rand promoted romantic realism .
she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her , except for Aristotle , Thomas Aqu@@ inas and classical liberals .
literary critics received Rand &apos;s fiction with mixed reviews and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy , though academic interest has increased in recent decades .
the Objec@@ ti@@ vist movement attempts to spread her ideas , both to the public and in academic settings .
she has been a significant influence among liber@@ tari@@ ans and American conservatives .

Rand later said she found school un@@ challenging and began writing screen@@ plays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten .
at the prestigious Sto@@ i@@ un@@ ina Gym@@ n@@ asium , her closest friend was Vladimir Nab@@ ok@@ ov &apos;s younger sister , Ol@@ ga .
the two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the Nab@@ ok@@ ov mansion : while Ol@@ ga defended constitutional monarchy , Al@@ isa supported republican ideals .
she was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917 , during which she favored Alexander Ker@@ en@@ sky over T@@ sar Nicholas II .
the subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bol@@ sh@@ evi@@ ks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed .
her father &apos;s business was confiscated , and the family fled to the Crimean Peninsula , which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War .
while in high school , she realized that she was an athe@@ ist and valued reason above any other human virtue .
after graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921 , she returned with her family to Petro@@ grad , where they faced desperate conditions , on occasion nearly starving .
after the Russian Revolution , universities were opened to women , allowing her to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petro@@ grad State University .
at the age of 16 , she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy , majoring in history .
at the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato , who would be her greatest influence and counter @-@ influence , respectively .
she also studied the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche .
able to read French , German and Russian , she also discovered the writers F@@ y@@ odor Do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky , Victor Hugo , Edmond Ro@@ stand , and Friedrich S@@ chiller , who became her perennial favorites .
along with many other bourgeois students , she was pur@@ ged from the university shortly before graduating .
after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists , however , many of the pur@@ ged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate , which she did in October 1924 .
she then studied for a year at the State Techn@@ ic@@ um for Screen Arts in Len@@ ingrad .
for an assignment she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pol@@ a Neg@@ ri , which became her first published work .
by this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be &quot; Rand &quot; , possibly because it is graphically similar to a vow@@ ell@@ ess excerpt Р@@ з@@ н@@ б of her birth surname in Cy@@ r@@ ill@@ ic handwriting , and she adopted the first name &quot; Ayn &quot; , either from a Finnish name &quot; A@@ ino &quot; or from the Hebrew word ע@@ י@@ ן .

in late 1925 , Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago .
she departed on January 17 , 1926 .
when she arrived in New York City on February 19 , 1926 , she was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan that she cried what she later called &quot; tears of splendor . &quot; intent on staying in the United States to become a screen@@ writer , she lived for a few months with her relatives , one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films free of charge .
she then left for Hollywood , California .
in Hollywood , a chance meeting with famed director Cec@@ il B. De@@ Mil@@ le led to work as an extra in his film &quot; The King of Kings &quot; and a subsequent job as a junior screen@@ writer .
while working on &quot; The King of Kings &quot; , she met an aspiring young actor , Frank O &apos;Connor ; the two were married on April 15 , 1929 .
she became a permanent American resident in July 1929 and an American citizen on March 3 , 1931 .
taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing , she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at R@@ KO Stu@@ di@@ os .
she made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States , but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate .

Rand &apos;s first literary success came with the sale of her screen@@ play &quot; Red P@@ aw@@ n &quot; to Universal Stu@@ di@@ os in 1932 , although it was never produced .
this was followed by the courtroom drama &quot; Night of January 16th &quot; , first produced by E. E. Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935 .
each night a jury was selected from members of the audience ; based on the jury &apos;s vote , one of two different endings would be performed .
in 1941 , Par@@ amount Pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play .
Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result . &quot;
ideal &quot; is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate .
the heroine is an actress who embodies Ran@@ dian ideals .
Rand &apos;s first published novel , the semi @-@ autobi@@ ographical &quot; We the Living &quot; , was published in 1936 .
set in Soviet Russia , it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state .
in a 1959 foreword to the novel , Rand stated that &quot; We the Living &quot; &quot; is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write . it is not an autobiography in the literal , but only in the intellectual sense . the plot is invented , the background is not ... &quot; Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print , although European editions continued to sell .
after the success of her later novels , Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies .
in 1942 , without Rand &apos;s knowledge or permission , the novel was made into a pair of Italian films , &quot; No@@ i vivi &quot; and &quot; Ad@@ dio , K@@ ira &quot; .
re@@ discovered in the 1960s , these films were re @-@ edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re @-@ released as &quot; We the Living &quot; in 1986 .
her nov@@ ella &quot; An@@ them &quot; was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel , &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; .
it presents a vision of a dy@@ stop@@ ian future world in which totalitarian collec@@ tivism has triumph@@ ed to such an extent that even the word &apos; I &apos; has been forgotten and replaced with &apos; we &apos; .
it was published in England in 1938 , but Rand initially could not find an American publisher .
as with &quot; We the Living &quot; , Rand &apos;s later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 , which has sold more than 3.5 million copies .
</p>
<p>
during the 1940s , Rand became politically active .
she and her husband worked as full @-@ time volunteers for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wend@@ ell Will@@ kie .
this work led to Rand &apos;s first public speaking experiences ; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had viewed pro @-@ Will@@ kie news@@ re@@ els .
this activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free @-@ market capitalism .
she became friends with journalist Henry Haz@@ lit@@ t and his wife , and Haz@@ lit@@ t introduced her to the Austrian School economist Lud@@ wig von M@@ ises .
despite her philosophical differences with them , Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career , and both of them expressed admiration for her .
M@@ ises once referred to Rand as &quot; the most courageous man in America , &quot; a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said &quot; man &quot; instead of &quot; woman . &quot; Rand also became friends with liber@@ tarian writer Isabel Pater@@ son .
Rand questioned Pater@@ son about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Pater@@ son ideas for her only non @-@ fiction book , &quot; The God of the Machine &quot; .
Rand &apos;s first major success as a writer came in 1943 with &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; , a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years .
the novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Ro@@ ark and his struggle against what Rand described as &quot; second @-@ han@@ ders &quot; - those who attempt to live through others , placing others above themselves .
it was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bob@@ bs @-@ Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archi@@ bald Og@@ den , who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it .
while completing the novel , Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Ben@@ z@@ ed@@ rine to fight fatigue .
the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel , but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks &apos; rest .
her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings . &quot;
the F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; became a worldwide success , bringing Rand fame and financial security .
in 1943 , Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bro@@ s. and she returned to Hollywood to write the screen@@ play .
finishing her work on that screen@@ play , she was hired by producer H@@ al B. Wall@@ is as a screen@@ writer and script @-@ doctor .
her work for Wall@@ is included the screen@@ plays for the Oscar @-@ nominated &quot; Love Letters &quot; and &quot; You C@@ ame A@@ long &quot; .
Rand also worked on other projects , including a planned non@@ fiction treatment of her philosophy to be called &quot; The Moral Basis of Indivi@@ du@@ alism &quot; .
although the planned book was never completed , a condensed version was published as an essay titled &quot; The Only Path to Tomorrow &quot; in the January 1944 edition of &quot; Reader &apos;s Digest &quot; magazine .
Rand extended her involvement with free @-@ market and anti @-@ communist activism while working in Hollywood .
she became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American I@@ deals , a Hollywood anti @-@ Communist group , and wrote articles on the group &apos;s behalf .
she also joined the anti @-@ Communist American Writers Association .
a visit by Isabel Pater@@ son to meet with Rand &apos;s California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Pater@@ son made comments , which Rand considered rude , to valued political allies .
in 1947 , during the Second Red S@@ care , Rand testified as a &quot; friendly witness &quot; before the United States House U@@ n @-@ American Activities Committee .
her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film &quot; Song of Russia &quot; .
Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union , portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was .
she wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film &quot; The Best Years of Our Lives &quot; for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world , but she was not allowed to testify about it .
when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations , Rand described the process as &quot; futile . &quot; after several delays , the film version of &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; was released in 1949 .
although it used Rand &apos;s screen@@ play with minimal alterations , she &quot; disliked the movie from beginning to end , &quot; and complained about its editing , acting , and other elements .
</p>
<p>
in the years following the publication of &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; , Rand received numerous letters from readers , some of whom the book profoundly influenced .
in 1951 , Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City , where she gathered a group of these admirers around her .
this group included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , a young psychology student named Nathan Blu@@ men@@ thal and his wife Barbara and Barbara &apos;s cousin Leonard P@@ ei@@ k@@ off .
initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy .
she later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel , &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; , as the manuscript pages were written .
in 1954 Rand &apos;s close relationship with the younger Na@@ than@@ iel Bran@@ den turned into a romantic affair , with the consent of their spouses . &quot;
Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; , published in 1957 , was considered Rand &apos;s &quot; magn@@ um op@@ us &quot; .
Rand described the theme of the novel as &quot; the role of the mind in man &apos;s existence - and , as a corollary , the demonstration of a new moral philosophy : the morality of rational self @-@ interest . &quot; it advocates the core tenets of Rand &apos;s philosophy of Objec@@ tivism and expresses her concept of human achievement .
the plot involves a dy@@ stop@@ ian United States in which the most creative industri@@ alists , scientists , and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hi@@ dea@@ way where they build an independent free economy .
the novel &apos;s hero and leader of the strike , John Gal@@ t , describes the strike as &quot; stopping the motor of the world &quot; by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation &apos;s wealth and achievement .
with this fictional strike , Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive , the economy would collapse and society would fall apart .
the novel includes elements of mystery , romance , and science fiction , and it contains an extended exposition of Objec@@ tivism in the form of a lengthy mon@@ ologue delivered by Gal@@ t .
despite many negative reviews , &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; became an international best@@ seller .
in an interview with Mike Wallace , Rand declared herself &quot; the most creative thinker alive . &quot; however , Rand was discouraged and depressed by the reaction of intellectuals to the novel . &quot;
Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; was Rand &apos;s last completed work of fiction ; it marked the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher .
in 1958 , Na@@ than@@ iel Bran@@ den established Na@@ than@@ iel Bran@@ den Lec@@ tures , later incorporated as the Na@@ than@@ iel Bran@@ den Institute , to promote Rand &apos;s philosophy .
collective members gave lectures for N@@ BI and wrote articles for Objec@@ ti@@ vist periodicals that she edited .
Rand later published some of these articles in book form .
critics , including some former N@@ BI students and Bran@@ den himself , later described the culture of N@@ BI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand , with some describing N@@ BI or the Objec@@ ti@@ vist movement itself as a cult or religion .
Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics , from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair , and some of her followers mim@@ icked her preferences , wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers .
however , some former N@@ BI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated , and the problem was concentrated among Rand &apos;s closest followers in New York .
Rand was un@@ impressed with many of the N@@ BI students and held them to strict standards , sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her .
</p>
<p>
throughout the 1960s and 1970s , Rand developed and promoted her Objec@@ ti@@ vist philosophy through her non@@ fiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale , Princeton , Columbia , Harvard , and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
she received an honorary Doc@@ torate of Hum@@ ane Letters from Lewis &amp; Clark College on 2 October 1963 .
she also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum , responding afterward to questions from the audience .
during these speeches and Q &amp; A sessions , she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day .
these included supporting abortion rights , opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft , supporting Israel in the Y@@ om K@@ ip@@ pur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as &quot; civilized men fighting sav@@ ages , &quot; saying European colonists had the right to develop land taken from American Indians , and calling homosexuality &quot; immoral &quot; and &quot; disgusting , &quot; while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it .
she also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States , most strongly Barry Gold@@ water in 1964 , whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for &quot; The Objec@@ ti@@ vist Newsletter &quot; .
in 1964 , Na@@ than@@ iel Bran@@ den began an affair with the young actress Pat@@ re@@ cia Scott , whom he later married .
Na@@ than@@ iel and Barbara Bran@@ den kept the affair hidden from Rand .
when she learned of it in 1968 , though her romantic relationship with Bran@@ den had already ended , Rand terminated her relationship with both Bran@@ dens , which led to the closure of N@@ BI .
Rand published an article in &quot; The Objec@@ ti@@ vist &quot; repudi@@ ating Na@@ than@@ iel Bran@@ den for dishonesty and other &quot; irrational behavior in his private life . &quot; Bran@@ den later apologized in an interview to &quot; every student of Objec@@ tivism &quot; for &quot; perpetuating the Ayn Rand mysti@@ que &quot; and for &quot; contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repres@@ siveness that perv@@ ades the Objec@@ ti@@ vist movement . &quot; in subsequent years , Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company .
Rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking .
in 1976 , she retired from writing her newsletter and , despite her initial objections , she allowed social worker Ev@@ va Pr@@ yor , an employee of her attorney , to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare .
during the late 1970s her activities within the Objec@@ ti@@ vist movement declined , especially after the death of her husband on November 9 , 1979 .
one of her final projects was work on a never @-@ completed television adaptation of &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; .
Rand died of heart failure on March 6 , 1982 , at her home in New York City , and was inter@@ red in the K@@ ens@@ ico Cemetery , Val@@ hall@@ a , New York .
Rand &apos;s funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers , including Alan Greenspan .
a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket .
in her will , Rand named Leonard P@@ ei@@ k@@ off to inherit her estate .
</p>
<p>
Rand called her philosophy &quot; Objec@@ tivism , &quot; describing its essence as &quot; the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute . &quot; she considered Objec@@ tivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics , epistem@@ ology , ethics , political philosophy , and aesthetics .
in metaphysics , Rand supported philosophical realism , and opposed anything she regarded as mys@@ ticism or super@@ natur@@ alism , including all forms of religion .
in epistem@@ ology , she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception , the validity of which she considered axi@@ omatic , and reason , which she described as &quot; the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man &apos;s senses . &quot; she rejected all claims of non @-@ perceptual or &quot; a priori &quot; knowledge , including instinct , &apos; &apos; intuition , &apos; &apos; revelation , &apos; or any form of &apos; just knowing .
in her &quot; Introduction to Objec@@ ti@@ vist E@@ pist@@ em@@ ology &quot; , Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic @-@ synthetic dichotomy .
in ethics , Rand argued for rational and ethical ego@@ ism , as the guiding moral principle .
she opposed statis@@ m , which she understood to include the@@ ocracy , absolute monarchy , Nazism , fascism , communism , democratic socialism , and dictatorship .
Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government .
although her political views are often classified as conservative or liber@@ tarian , she preferred the term &quot; radical for capitalism . &quot; she worked with conservatives on political projects , but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics .
she denounced liber@@ tarianism , which she associated with anarch@@ ism .
she rejected anarch@@ ism as a na@@ ï@@ ve theory based in subjec@@ tivism that could only lead to collec@@ tivism in practice .
in aesthetics , Rand defined art as a &quot; selective re @-@ creation of reality according to an artist &apos;s metaphysical value @-@ judgments . &quot; according to her , art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped , thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness .
as a writer , the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature , where she considered roman@@ ticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will .
she described her own approach to literature as &quot; romantic realism . &quot; Rand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend &quot; three A &apos;s &quot; - Aristotle , Aqu@@ inas , and Ayn Rand .
in a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace , when asked where her philosophy came from she responded :
&quot; out of my own mind , with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle , the only philosopher who ever influenced me . I devised the rest of my philosophy myself . &quot; however , she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche , and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand &apos;s journals , in passages from the first edition of &quot; We the Living &quot; , and in her overall writing style .
however , by the time she wrote &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; , Rand had turned against Nietzsche &apos;s ideas , and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed .
rational ego@@ ism was embodied by Russian author Nikolay Cher@@ ny@@ sh@@ ev@@ sky in the 1863 novel &quot; What Is to Be D@@ one ? &quot; and several critics claim that &quot; What Is to Be D@@ one ? &quot; is one of the sources of inspiration for Rand &apos;s thought .
for example , the book &apos;s main character Lop@@ u@@ h@@ ov says &quot; I am not a man to make sacrifices . and indeed there are no such things . one acts in the way that one finds most pleasant . &quot; among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Im@@ manuel Kant , whom she referred to as a &quot; monster , &quot; although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Sed@@ don have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences .
Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her &quot; theory of concepts , &#91; her &#93; ethics , and &#91; her &#93; discovery in politics that evil - the violation of rights - consists of the initiation of force . &quot; she believed epistem@@ ology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy , stating :
&quot; I am not &quot; primarily &quot; an advocate of capitalism , but of ego@@ ism ; and I am not &quot; primarily &quot; an advocate of ego@@ ism , but of reason . if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently , all the rest follows . &quot;
</p>
<p>
during Rand &apos;s lifetime , her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation .
Rand &apos;s first novel , &quot; We the Living &quot; , was admired by the literary critic H. L. M@@ enc@@ ken , her Broadway play &quot; Night of January 16th &quot; was both a critical and popular success , and &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; was hailed by &quot; The New York Times &quot; reviewer Lor@@ ine P@@ ru@@ ette as &quot; master@@ ful . &quot; Rand &apos;s novels were deri@@ ded by some critics when they were first published as being long and melo@@ dramatic .
however , they became best@@ sellers largely through word of mouth .
the first reviews Rand received were for &quot; Night of January 16th &quot; .
reviews of the production were largely positive , but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer .
Rand believed that her first novel , &quot; We the Living &quot; , was not widely reviewed , but Rand scholar Michael S. Ber@@ liner writes &quot; it was the most reviewed of any of her works , &quot; with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications .
overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work .
her 1938 nov@@ ella &quot; An@@ them &quot; received little attention from reviewers , both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re @-@ issues .
Rand &apos;s first best@@ seller , &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; , received far fewer reviews than &quot; We the Living &quot; , and reviewers &apos; opinions were mixed .
Lor@@ ine P@@ ru@@ ette &apos;s positive review in &quot; The New York Times &quot; was one that Rand greatly appreciated .
P@@ ru@@ ette called Rand &quot; a writer of great power &quot; who wrote &quot; brilliantly , beautifully and bitterly , &quot; and stated that &quot; you will not be able to read this master@@ ful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time . &quot; there were other positive reviews , but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications .
some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel , such as one that called it &quot; a whale of a book &quot; and another that said &quot; anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper @-@ rationing . &quot; other negative reviews called the characters un@@ sympathetic and Rand &apos;s style &quot; offen@@ sively pedestrian . &quot; Rand &apos;s 1957 novel &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative .
Rand &apos;s non@@ fiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had . the tenor of the criticism for her first non@@ fiction book , &quot; For the New Intellectual &quot; , was similar to that for &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; , with philosopher Sid@@ ney H@@ ook lik@@ ening her certainty to &quot; the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union , &quot; and author Gore V@@ idal calling her viewpoint &quot; nearly perfect in its im@@ morality . &quot;
her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers . on the 100th anniversary of Rand &apos;s birth in 2005 , Edward Roth@@ stein , writing for &quot; The New York Times &quot; , referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian &quot; re@@ tro fantasy &quot; and programmatic neo @-@ Roman@@ ticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters &apos; &quot; isolated rejection of democratic society . &quot;
in 2007 , book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as &quot; romance novels with a p@@ atina of pseudo @-@ philosophy . &quot;
in 2009 , &quot; G@@ Q &quot; s critic columnist Tom Car@@ son described her books as &quot; capitalism &apos;s version of middle@@ brow religious novels &quot; such as &quot; &quot; and the &quot; Left Behind &quot; series .
</p>
<p>
in 1991 , a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent &apos;s life was .
Rand &apos;s &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; was the second most popular choice , after the Bible .
Rand &apos;s books continue to be widely sold and read , with over 29 million copies sold .
in 1998 , Modern Library readers voted &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; the 20th century &apos;s finest work of fiction , followed by &quot; The F@@ oun@@ tain@@ head &quot; in second place , &quot; An@@ them &quot; in seventh , and &quot; We the Living &quot; eighth ; none of the four appeared on the critics &apos; list .
although Rand &apos;s influence has been greatest in the United States , there has been international interest in her work .
Rand &apos;s work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India .
Rand &apos;s contemporary admirers included fellow novel@@ ists , such as I@@ ra Lev@@ in , Kay Nol@@ te Smith and L. Neil Smith ; and later writers such as Eri@@ ka Hol@@ zer and Terry Good@@ kind have been influenced by her .
other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve D@@ it@@ ko and musician Neil Pear@@ t of Rus@@ h .
Rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work .
John All@@ ison of BB &amp; T and Ed S@@ ni@@ der of Com@@ cast Spec@@ tac@@ or have funded the promotion of Rand &apos;s ideas , while Mark Cuban as well as John P. Mac@@ key among others have said they consider Rand crucial to their success .
Rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media : on television shows including animated sit@@ com@@ s , live @-@ action come@@ dies , dramas , and game shows , as well as in movies and video games .
she , or a character based on her , figures prominently in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors .
Nick Gill@@ es@@ pie , editor in chief of &quot; Reason &quot; , has remarked that &quot; Rand &apos;s is a tortured immortality , one in which she &apos;s as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist ... &quot; and that &quot; ji@@ bes at Rand as cold and inhuman , run through the popular culture . &quot; two movies have been made about Rand &apos;s life .
a 1997 documentary film , &quot; &quot; , was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Docu@@ mentary Feature . &quot;
the Pas@@ sion of Ayn Rand &quot; , a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name , won several awards .
Rand &apos;s image also appears on a 1999 U.S. postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Ga@@ et@@ ano .
</p>
<p>
although she rejected the labels &quot; conservative &quot; and &quot; liber@@ tarian , &quot; Rand has had continuing influence on right @-@ wing politics and liber@@ tarianism .
Jim Powell , a senior fellow at the Ca@@ to Institute , considers Rand one of the three most important women of modern American liber@@ tarianism , and David Nol@@ an , one of the founders of the Liber@@ tarian Party , stated that &quot; without Ayn Rand , the liber@@ tarian movement would not exist . &quot; in his history of the liber@@ tarian movement , journalist Brian Do@@ herty described her as &quot; the most influential liber@@ tarian of the twentieth century to the public at large &quot; and bi@@ ographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as &quot; the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right . &quot; economist and Ayn Rand student George Re@@ is@@ man wrote :
&quot; Ayn Rand ... in particular , must be cited as providing a philosophical foundation for the case of capitalism , and as being responsible probably more than anyone else for the current spread of pro @-@ capitalist ideas . &quot; she faced intense opposition from William F. Buck@@ ley , J@@ r. and other contributors for the &quot; National Review &quot; magazine .
they published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by Whit@@ taker Chambers , Gar@@ ry W@@ ills , and M. St@@ anton Evans .
nevertheless , her influence among conservatives forced Buck@@ ley and other &quot; National Review &quot; contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism .
the political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives , despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives , such as being pro @-@ choice and an athe@@ ist .
a 1987 article in &quot; The New York Times &quot; referred to her as the Reagan administration &apos;s &quot; novelist laureate . &quot; Republican Congres@@ smen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels .
the financial crisis of 2007 @-@ 2008 spurred renewed interest in her works , especially &quot; Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; , which some saw as foreshad@@ owing the crisis .
opinion articles compared real @-@ world events with the plot of the novel .
during this time , signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Gal@@ t appeared at Tea Party protests .
there was also increased criticism of her ideas , especially from the political left , with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets , particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan .
for example , &quot; Mother Jones &quot; remarked that &quot; Rand &apos;s particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy , the talented , and the powerful as the oppressed &quot; while equ@@ ating Ran@@ dian individual well @-@ being with that of the &quot; Vol@@ k &quot; according to Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s .
Cor@@ ey Robin of &quot; The Nation &quot; alleged similarities between the &quot; moral syntax of Ran@@ di@@ anism &quot; and fascism .
</p>

during Rand &apos;s lifetime , her work received little attention from academic scholars .
when the first academic book about Rand &apos;s philosophy appeared in 1971 , its author declared writing about Rand &quot; a treacherous undertaking &quot; that could lead to &quot; guilt by association &quot; for taking her seriously .
a few articles about Rand &apos;s ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 , many of them in &quot; The Person@@ alist &quot; .
one of these was &quot; On the Ran@@ dian Ar@@ gu@@ ment &quot; by liber@@ tarian philosopher Robert No@@ z@@ ick , who argued that her meta @-@ ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is @-@ ought problem posed by David Hum@@ e .
some responses to No@@ z@@ ick by other academic philosophers were also published in &quot; The Person@@ alist &quot; arguing that No@@ z@@ ick mis@@ stated Rand &apos;s case .
academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited .
academic M@@ imi Glad@@ stein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand &apos;s novels when she began researching her in 1973 , and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s .
since Rand &apos;s death , interest in her work has gradually increased .
historian Jennifer Burns has identified &quot; three overlapping waves &quot; of scholarly interest in Rand , the most recent of which is &quot; an explosion of scholarship &quot; since the year 2000 .
however , few universities currently include Rand or Objec@@ tivism as a philosophical specialty or research area , with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study .
Glad@@ stein , Harry B@@ ins@@ wan@@ ger , Allan Got@@ th@@ elf , John Hos@@ pers , Edwin A. Locke , Wallace Mat@@ son , Leonard P@@ ei@@ k@@ off , Chris Matthew Sci@@ ab@@ arra , and Tara Smith have taught her work in academic institutions .
Sci@@ ab@@ arra co @-@ ed@@ its the &quot; Journal of Ayn Rand Studies &quot; , a non@@ partisan peer @-@ reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand &apos;s philosophical and literary work .
in 1987 Got@@ th@@ elf , George Walsh and David Kel@@ ley co @-@ founded the Ayn Rand Society , a group affiliated with the American Philosoph@@ ical Association .
in 2012 , the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an &quot; Ayn Rand Society Philosoph@@ ical Studies &quot; series based on the proceedings of the Society .
Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand &apos;s ideas , including &quot; Ayn Rand &apos;s Normative Ethics : the Vir@@ tuous E@@ go@@ ist &quot; , a volume on Rand &apos;s ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press .
Rand &apos;s ideas have also been made subjects of study at Cl@@ em@@ son and Duke universities .
scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work , although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s .
Liber@@ tarian philosopher Michael Hu@@ em@@ er argues that very few people find Rand &apos;s ideas convincing , especially her ethics , which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence .
he attributes the attention she receives to her being a &quot; compelling writer , &quot; especially as a novelist . &quot;
Atlas Sh@@ rugged &quot; thus out@@ sells Rand &apos;s non @-@ fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as Lud@@ wig von M@@ ises , Friedrich Hay@@ ek , or Freder@@ ic Bas@@ ti@@ at .
political scientist Charles Murray , while praising Rand &apos;s literary accomplishments , criticizes her claim that her only &quot; philosophical debt &quot; was to Aristotle , instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche .
although Rand maintained that Objec@@ tivism was an integrated philosophical system , philosopher Robert H. B@@ ass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas .
</p>
<p>
in 1985 , Rand &apos;s intellectual heir Leonard P@@ ei@@ k@@ off established the Ayn Rand Institute , a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand &apos;s ideas and works .
in 1990 , after an ideological disagreement with P@@ ei@@ k@@ off , philosopher David Kel@@ ley founded the Institute for Objec@@ ti@@ vist Studies , now known as The Atlas Society .
in 2001 , historian John Mc@@ Cas@@ key organized the An@@ them Foundation for Objec@@ ti@@ vist Scholarship , which provides grants for scholarly work on Objec@@ tivism in academia .
the charitable foundation of BB &amp; T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand &apos;s ideas or works .
the University of Texas at Austin , the University of Pittsburgh , and University of North Carolina at Chap@@ el Hill are among the schools that have received grants .
in some cases , these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand .

Andre Kir@@ k Ag@@ assi is an American retired professional tennis player and former world No. 1 who was one of the sport &apos;s most dominant players from the early 1990s to the mid @-@ 2000s .
generally considered by critics and fellow players to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time , Ag@@ assi has been called the greatest service retur@@ ner ever to play the game and was described by the BBC upon his retirement as &quot; perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport &apos;s history . &quot; as a result , he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s .
in singles tennis , Ag@@ assi is an eight @-@ time Grand S@@ lam champion and a 1996 Olympic gold med@@ alist , as well as being a runner @-@ up in seven other Grand S@@ lam tournaments .
during the Open Era , Ag@@ assi was the first male player to win four Australian Open titles , a record that was later surpassed by Nov@@ ak D@@ jo@@ kovic when he won his fifth title in 2015 , and then by Roger Feder@@ er in 2017 .
Ag@@ assi is one of five male singles players to achieve the Career Grand S@@ lam in the Open Era and one of eight in history , the first of two to achieve the Career Golden S@@ lam , and the only man to win the Career Golden S@@ lam and the AT@@ P Tour World Championships : a distinction dubbed as a &quot; Career Super S@@ lam &quot; by &quot; Sports Illu@@ strated &quot; .
Ag@@ assi was the first male player to win all four Grand S@@ lam tournaments on three different surfaces , and the last American male to win both the French Open and the Australian Open .
he also won 17 AT@@ P Masters Series titles and was part of the winning Davis Cup teams in 1990 , 1992 and 1995 .
Ag@@ assi reached the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid @-@ to @-@ late 1990s and sank to No. 141 in 1997 , prompting many to believe that his career was over .
Ag@@ assi returned to No. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years .
during his 20 @-@ plus year tour career , Ag@@ assi was known by the nickname &quot; The Pun@@ isher . &quot; Meh@@ ro@@ tra , Ab@@ h@@ ish@@ ek .

after suffering from sci@@ atic@@ a caused by two bulging discs in his back , a spon@@ dyl@@ ol@@ is@@ thesis and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve , Ag@@ assi retired from professional tennis on September 3 , 2006 , after losing in the third round of the US Open to Benjamin Becker .
he is the founder of the Andre Ag@@ assi Charitable Foundation , which has raised over $ 60 million for at @-@ risk children in Southern Nevada .
in 2001 , the Foundation opened the Andre Ag@@ assi College Preparatory Academy in Las Vegas , a K @-@ 12 public charter school for at @-@ risk children .
he has been married to fellow tennis player Ste@@ ff@@ i Gra@@ f since 2001 .

<p>
Andre Ag@@ assi was born in Las Vegas , Nevada to Emmanuel &quot; Mike &quot; Ag@@ assi , a former Olympic boxer from Iran and Elizabeth &quot; Betty &quot; Ag@@ assi .
his father claims to have Armenian and Assyrian heritage .
one of his ancestors changed his surname from Armenian Agh@@ assi@@ an to less noticeable Ag@@ assi to avoid persecution .
Andre Ag@@ assi &apos;s mother , Betty , is a breast cancer survivor .
he has three older siblings - Rita , Philip and T@@ ami .
Andre was given the middle name Kir@@ k after Kir@@ k Ker@@ kor@@ ian , an Armenian American billionaire .
Ag@@ assi , a waiter at Tro@@ pic@@ ana Las Vegas , met Ker@@ kor@@ ian in 1963 .
Ag@@ assi at the age of 12 won the 1982 National In@@ door Boys 14@@ s Dou@@ bles Championship in Chicago .
Ag@@ assi describes more of his memorable experiences and juvenile pr@@ anks with Rod@@ dy in his book &quot; Open &quot; .
at the age of 13 , Ag@@ assi was sent to Nick Bol@@ let@@ ti@@ eri &apos;s Tennis Academy in Florida .
he was meant to stay for only three months because that was all his father could afford .
after thirty minutes of watching Ag@@ assi play , Bol@@ let@@ ti@@ eri called Mike and said :
&quot; take your check back . he &apos;s here for free , &quot; claiming that Ag@@ assi had more natural talent than anyone else he had seen .
Ag@@ assi dropped out of school in the ninth grade .

he won six additional tournaments in 1988 , and , by December of that year , he had surpassed US $ 1 million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournaments - the fastest anyone in history had reached that level .
during 1988 , he also set the open @-@ era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager .
his year @-@ end ranking was No. 3 , behind second @-@ ranked Ivan L@@ end@@ l and top @-@ ranked M@@ ats Wil@@ ander .
both the Association of Tennis Professionals and &quot; Tennis &quot; magazine named Ag@@ assi the Most Improved Player of the Year for 1988 .
in addition to not playing the Australian Open for the first eight years of his career , Ag@@ assi chose not to play at Wim@@ bled@@ on from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event &apos;s tradi@@ tionalism , particularly its &quot; predominantly white &quot; dress code to which players at the event are required to conform .
strong performances on the tour meant that Ag@@ assi was quickly tipped as a future Grand S@@ lam champion .
while still a teenager , he reached the semi@@ finals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semi@@ finals in 1989 .
he began the 1990s with a series of near @-@ misses .
he reached his first Grand S@@ lam final in 1990 at the French Open , where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez , which he later attributed in his book to worrying about his wig falling off during the match .
he reached his second Grand S@@ lam final of the year at the US Open , defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semi@@ finals .
his opponent in the final was Pete Sam@@ pr@@ as ; a year earlier , Ag@@ assi had crushed Sam@@ pr@@ as , after which time he told his coach that he felt bad for Sam@@ pr@@ as because he was never going to make it as a pro .

he reached the quarter@@ finals on that occasion , losing in five sets to David Whe@@ aton .
Ag@@ assi &apos;s Grand S@@ lam tournament breakthrough came at Wim@@ bled@@ on , not at the French Open or the US Open , where he had previously enjoyed success .
in 1992 , he defeated Goran Ivan@@ i@@ šević in a five @-@ set final .
along the way , Ag@@ assi overcame two former Wim@@ bled@@ on champions : Boris Becker and John Mc@@ En@@ ro@@ e .
no other basel@@ iner would triumph at Wim@@ bled@@ on until L@@ ley@@ ton Hew@@ itt ten years later .
Ag@@ assi was named the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1992 .
Ag@@ assi once again played on the United States &apos; Davis Cup winning team in 1992 .
it was their second Davis cup title in three years .

although he made the quarter@@ finals in his Wim@@ bled@@ on title defense , he lost to eventual champion and No. 1 Pete Sam@@ pr@@ as in five sets .
Ag@@ assi lost in the first round at the US Open to Thomas En@@ q@@ vist and required wrist surgery late in the year .
</p>
<p>
with new coach Brad Gilbert on board , Ag@@ assi began to employ more of a tactical , consistent approach , which fueled his resurgence .
he started slowly in 1994 , losing in the first week at the French Open and Wim@@ bled@@ on .
nevertheless , he emerged during the hard @-@ court season , winning the Canadian Open .
his comeback culminated at the 1994 US Open with a five @-@ set fourth @-@ round victory against compatri@@ ot Michael Chang .
he then became the first man to capture the US Open as an un@@ see@@ ded player , beating Michael S@@ tic@@ h in the final .
along the way , he beat 5 see@@ ded players .

the streak ended the next day when Ag@@ assi lost the final to Sam@@ pr@@ as .
Ag@@ assi reached the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in April 1995 .
he held that ranking until November , for a total of 30 weeks .
Ag@@ assi skipped most of the fall indoor season which allowed Sam@@ pr@@ as to surpass him and finish ranked No. 1 at the year @-@ end ranking .
in terms of win / loss record , 1995 was Ag@@ assi &apos;s best year .
he won 73 and lost 9 matches , and was also once again a key player on the United States &apos; Davis Cup winning team - the third and final Davis Cup title of his career .
1996 was a less successful year for Ag@@ assi , as he failed to reach any Grand S@@ lam final .
he suffered two early @-@ round losses at the hands of compatriots Chris Woo@@ dru@@ ff and Doug Fl@@ ach at the French Open and Wim@@ bled@@ on , respectively , and lost to Chang in straight sets in the Australian and US Open semi@@ finals .
at the time , Ag@@ assi blamed the Australian Open loss on the windy conditions , but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose , as he did not want to play Boris Becker , whom he would have faced in that final .
the high point for Ag@@ assi was winning the men &apos;s singles gold medal at the Olympic Games in Atlanta , beating Ser@@ gi Bru@@ gu@@ era of Spain in the final .
Ag@@ assi also successfully defended his singles titles in Cincinnati and Key B@@ isc@@ ay@@ ne .
1997 was the low point of Ag@@ assi &apos;s career .

he later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine at that time , allegedly on the urging of a friend .
he failed an AT@@ P drug test , but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink .
the AT@@ P dropped the failed drug test as a warning .
in his autobiography , Ag@@ assi admitted that the letter was a lie .
he quit the drug soon after .
at this time Ag@@ assi was also in a failing marriage with actress Bro@@ oke Shi@@ elds and had lost interest in the game .
he won no top @-@ level titles , and his ranking sank to No. 141 on November 10 , 1997 , prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sport &apos;s premier competitors was over and he would never again win any significant championships .
</p>
<p>
in 1998 , Ag@@ assi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in Challeng@@ er Series tournaments , a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world &apos;s top 50 .
after returning to top physical and mental shape , Ag@@ assi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against Pete Sam@@ pr@@ as and Patrick R@@ after .

he won five titles in ten finals and was runner @-@ up at the Masters Series tournament in Key B@@ isc@@ ay@@ ne , losing to Marcelo R@@ íos , who became No. 1 as a result .
at the year end he was awarded the AT@@ P Most Improved Player of the Year for the second time in his career .
Ag@@ assi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat Andrei Medvedev in a five @-@ set French Open final , becoming , at the time , only the fifth male player to win all four Grand S@@ lam singles titles during his career .
only Lav@@ er , Ag@@ assi , Feder@@ er , Nad@@ al and D@@ jo@@ kovic have achieved this feat during the open era .
this win also made him the first male player in history to have won all four Grand S@@ lam titles on three different surfaces .
Ag@@ assi also became the only male player to win the Career Super S@@ lam , consisting of all four Grand S@@ lam tournaments plus an Olympic gold medal in singles and a Year @-@ End Championship .

he rebounded from his Wim@@ bled@@ on defeat by winning the US Open , beating Todd Martin in five sets in the final .
overall during the year Ag@@ assi won 5 titles including two majors and the AT@@ P Masters Series in Paris , where he beat Mar@@ at Saf@@ in .
Ag@@ assi ended 1999 as the No. 1 , ending Sam@@ pr@@ as &apos;s record of six consecutive year @-@ ending top rankings .
this was the only time Ag@@ assi ended the year at No. 1 .
he began the next year by capturing his second Australian Open title , beating Sam@@ pr@@ as in a five @-@ set semi@@ final and Y@@ ev@@ geny Kaf@@ el@@ nikov in a four @-@ set final .
he was the first male player to have reached four consecutive Grand S@@ lam finals since Ro@@ d Lav@@ er achieved the Grand S@@ lam in 1969 .
at the time , Ag@@ assi was also only the fourth player since Lav@@ er to be the re@@ igning champion of three of four Grand S@@ lam events , missing only the Wim@@ bled@@ on title ..
2000 also saw Ag@@ assi reach the semi@@ finals at Wim@@ bled@@ on , where he lost in five sets to R@@ after in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at Wim@@ bled@@ on .
at the inaugural Tennis Masters Cup in Lisbon , Ag@@ assi reached the final after defeating Mar@@ at Saf@@ in in the semi@@ finals to end the Russian &apos;s hopes to become the youngest No. 1 in the history of tennis .
Ag@@ assi then lost to Gustavo Ku@@ er@@ ten in the final , allowing Ku@@ er@@ ten to be crowned year @-@ end No. 1 .
Ag@@ assi opened 2001 by successfully defending his Australian Open title with a straight @-@ sets final win over Ar@@ nau@@ d Cl@@ é@@ ment .

despite the setback , Ag@@ assi finished 2001 ranked No. 3 , becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 3 in three different decades .
he also was the oldest player to finish in the top three since 32 @-@ year @-@ old Conn@@ ors finished at No. 2 in 1984 .
2002 opened with disappointment for Ag@@ assi , as injury forced him to skip the Australian Open , where he was a two @-@ time defending champion .
Ag@@ assi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his Key B@@ isc@@ ay@@ ne title beating then rising Roger Feder@@ er in a four @-@ set final .
the last duel between Ag@@ assi and Sam@@ pr@@ as came in the final of the US Open , which Sam@@ pr@@ as won in four sets and left Sam@@ pr@@ as with a 20 @-@ 14 edge in their 34 career meetings .
the match was the last of Sam@@ pr@@ as &apos;s career .
Ag@@ assi &apos;s US Open finish , along with his Masters Series victories in Key B@@ isc@@ ay@@ ne , Rome and Madrid , helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year @-@ end No. 2 at 32 years and 8 months .

on April 28 , 2003 , he recap@@ tured the No. 1 ranking after winning the &quot; &apos; U.S. Men &apos;s Clay Court Championship &quot; &apos; and regained it after a quarter@@ final victory over Xavier Mal@@ isse at the Queen &apos;s Club Championships to become the oldest top @-@ ranked male player since the AT@@ P rankings began at 33 years and 13 days .
the record was later surpassed by Roger Feder@@ er in 2018 .
he had held the No. 1 ranking for two weeks , when L@@ ley@@ ton Hew@@ itt took it back on May 12 , 2003 .
Ag@@ assi then recap@@ tured the No. 1 ranking once again on June 16 , 2003 , which he held for 12 weeks until September 7 , 2003 .
during his career , Ag@@ assi held the No. 1 ranking for a total of 101 weeks .
Ag@@ assi &apos;s ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from many events .
he did manage to reach the US Open semi@@ finals , where he lost to Juan Carlos Ferr@@ ero and surrendered his No. 1 ranking to Ferr@@ ero .
at the year @-@ end Tennis Masters Cup , Ag@@ assi lost in the final to Feder@@ er and finished the year ranked No. 4 .
at age 33 , he was the oldest player to rank in the top 5 since Conn@@ ors , at age 35 , was No. 4 in 1987 .
</p>
<p>
in 2004 , Ag@@ assi began the year with a five @-@ set loss in the semi@@ finals of the Australian Open to Mar@@ at Saf@@ in ; the loss ended Ag@@ assi &apos;s 26 @-@ match winning streak at the event , a record that still stands .
he won the Masters series event in Cincinnati to bring his career total to 59 top @-@ level singles titles and a record 17 AT@@ P Masters Series titles , having already won seven of the nine AT@@ P Masters tournament - all except the tournaments in Monte Carlo and Hamburg .

Ag@@ assi also became only the sixth male player during the open era to reach 800 career wins with his first @-@ round victory over Alex Bog@@ om@@ ol@@ ov in Country@@ wide Class@@ ic in Los Angeles .
Ag@@ assi &apos;s 2005 began with a quarter@@ final loss to Feder@@ er at the Australian Open .
Ag@@ assi had several other deep runs at tournaments , but had to withdraw from several events due to injury .
he lost to Jar@@ k@@ ko Ni@@ emin@@ en in the first round of the French Open .
he won his fourth title in Los Angeles and reached the final of the Rogers Cup , before falling to No. 2 Rafael Nad@@ al .
Ag@@ assi &apos;s 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the US Open final .
after beating R@@ ă@@ z@@ van Sab@@ ă@@ u and I@@ vo Kar@@ lo@@ vić in straight sets and Tom@@ á@@ š Ber@@ dy@@ ch in four sets , Ag@@ assi won three consecutive five @-@ set matches to advance to the final .
the most notable of these matches was his quarter@@ final victory over James Blake , where he rallied from two sets down to win in the fifth set tie @-@ breaker .
his other five @-@ set victims were Xavier Mal@@ isse in the fourth round and Rob@@ by Gin@@ ep@@ ri in the semi@@ finals .
in the final , Ag@@ assi faced Feder@@ er , who was seeking his second consecutive US Open title and his sixth Grand S@@ lam title in two years .
Feder@@ er defeated Ag@@ assi in four sets .
Ag@@ assi finished 2005 ranked No. 7 , his 16th time in the year @-@ end top @-@ 10 rankings , which tied Conn@@ ors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year &apos;s end .
Ag@@ assi had a poor start to 2006 .
he was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play .
Ag@@ assi withdrew from the Australian Open because of the ankle injury , and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events , eventually skipping the entire clay @-@ court season including the French Open .
this caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time .
Ag@@ assi returned for the grass @-@ court season , playing a tune @-@ up , and then Wim@@ bled@@ on .
he was defeated in the third round by world No. 2 Rafael Nad@@ al .
against conventions , Ag@@ assi , the losing player , was interviewed on court after the match .
at Wim@@ bled@@ on , Ag@@ assi announced his plans to retire following the US Open .
Ag@@ assi played only two events during the summer hard @-@ court season with his best result being a quarter@@ final loss at the Country@@ wide Class@@ ic in Los Angeles to Fernando González of Chile , which resulted in him being un@@ see@@ ded at the US Open .
Ag@@ assi had a short , but dramatic , run in his final US Open .
because of extreme back pain , Ag@@ assi was forced to receive anti @-@ inflammatory injections after every match .
after a tough four @-@ set win against Andrei Pavel , Ag@@ assi faced eighth @-@ see@@ ded Marcos Bagh@@ d@@ atis in the second round who had earlier advanced to the 2006 Australian Open final and Wim@@ bled@@ on semi@@ finals .
Ag@@ assi won in five tough sets as the younger Bagh@@ d@@ atis succumbed to muscle cram@@ ping in the final set .
in his last match , Ag@@ assi fell to 1@@ 12th @-@ ranked big @-@ serving Benjamin Becker of Germany in four sets .
Ag@@ assi received a four @-@ minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech .

<p>
the rivalry has been considered the greatest of the generation of players competing in the 90 &apos;s , as Sam@@ pr@@ as and Ag@@ assi were the most successful players of that decade .
they also had very contrasting playing styles , with Sam@@ pr@@ as being considered the greatest server while Ag@@ assi the greatest serve retur@@ ner of the game .
Ag@@ assi and Sam@@ pr@@ as met 34 times on the tour level with Ag@@ assi trailing 14 @-@ 20 .
the 1990 US Open was their first meeting in a Grand S@@ lam tournament final .
Ag@@ assi was favored as he was ranked No. 4 at the time , compared to the No. 12 ranking of Sam@@ pr@@ as and because Ag@@ assi had defeated Sam@@ pr@@ as in their only previously completed match .
Ag@@ assi however lost the final to Sam@@ pr@@ as in straight sets .
their next meeting in a Grand S@@ lam was at the 1992 French Open , where they met in the quarter@@ finals .
although Sam@@ pr@@ as was ranked higher , Ag@@ assi came out winning in straight sets .
they met again on a Grand S@@ lam level at the quarter@@ finals of Wim@@ bled@@ on in 1993 , where Ag@@ assi was the defending champion and Sam@@ pr@@ as was the newly min@@ ted world No. 1 .
Ag@@ assi dug out from a two @-@ nothing hole , levelling the match at 2 sets apiece , however Sam@@ pr@@ as prevailed in five sets , and went on to win his first Wim@@ bled@@ on championship .
with both Sam@@ pr@@ as and Ag@@ assi participating , the U.S. won the Davis Cup in 1995 .
the year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won 3 out of 4 major titles , meeting each other twice in the finals , and were occupying top two spots in the rankings for the whole year .
they met 5 times during the year , all in the title matches , including the Australian Open , the News@@ week Champions Cup , the Lip@@ ton International P@@ layers Championships , the Canadian Open , and the US Open .
Ag@@ assi won three of the finals , including the Australian Open , however Sam@@ pr@@ as took the US Open title , ending Ag@@ assi &apos;s 26 @-@ match winning streak .
after Ag@@ assi had taken most of the fall season off , Sam@@ pr@@ as took over the No. 1 ranking for the end of the season .
in the following 3 years , while Sam@@ pr@@ as continued winning Grand S@@ lam titles every season , Ag@@ assi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions .
the next time Sam@@ pr@@ as and Ag@@ assi met in a Grand S@@ lam final was at Wim@@ bled@@ on in 1999 , where Sam@@ pr@@ as won in straight sets .
for both , it was considered a career rejuvenation , as Sam@@ pr@@ as had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while Ag@@ assi was regaining his status as a top @-@ ranked player after winning the French Open .
Sam@@ pr@@ as forfeited the No. 1 ranking to Ag@@ assi when injury forced him to withdraw from that year &apos;s US Open , which Ag@@ assi went on to win .
they faced each other twice in the season @-@ ending AT@@ P Tour World Championships , with Sam@@ pr@@ as losing the round @-@ rob@@ in match , but winning the final .
in 2000 &apos;s they met three more times on the Grand S@@ lam level offering three memorable contests .
in 2000 , the top @-@ ranked Ag@@ assi defeated No. 3 Sam@@ pr@@ as in the semi@@ finals of the Australian Open in five sets , which was an important win for Ag@@ assi who lost 4 of the previous 5 matches against Sam@@ pr@@ as .
in arguably their most memorable match ever , Sam@@ pr@@ as defeated Ag@@ assi in the 2001 US Open quarter@@ finals in four sets .
there were no breaks of serve during the entire match .
rer@@ uns of the match are frequently featured on television , especially during US Open rain delays , and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players .
their last meeting was the final of the 2002 US Open , which was their third meeting in a US Open final , but first since 1995 .
the match was also notable because they had defeated several up @-@ and @-@ coming players en route to the final .
Sam@@ pr@@ as had defeated No. 3 Tommy Ha@@ as in the fourth round and future No. 1 Andy Rod@@ dick in the quarter@@ finals , while Ag@@ assi had defeated No. 1 and defending champion L@@ ley@@ ton Hew@@ itt in the semi@@ finals .
Sam@@ pr@@ as defeated Ag@@ assi in four sets .
this was the final AT@@ P tour singles match of Sam@@ pr@@ as &apos;s career .
</p>
<p>
Michael Chang was the opponent Ag@@ assi faced the most frequently from all the players other than Sam@@ pr@@ as .
they met 22 times on the tour level with Ag@@ assi leading 15 @-@ 7 .
Chang , unlike most of Ag@@ assi &apos;s big rivals , had a playing style similar to his .
both players preferred to dominate the game from the baseline with Chang being more defensive @-@ minded .
the outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies .
the rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodig@@ ies of the next great generation of American tennis players , despite both having a foreign descent .
Ag@@ assi won first four matches including a straight set victory in the round 16 of the 1988 US Open and defeating Chang , the defending champion , in the 1990 French Open in a four @-@ set quarter@@ final .
arguably their best match took place in the round 16 of the 1994 US Open .
while both players presented high quality shot @-@ making , the momentum changed from set to set with Ag@@ assi eventually prevailing with a five @-@ set victory .
it turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first US Open title .
their next two Grand S@@ lam meetings came in 1996 , with Chang recording easy straight set victories in semi@@ finals of both the Australian Open and the US Open .
years after , Ag@@ assi shock@@ ingly admitted in his book , that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face Boris Becker , who was awaiting the winner in the final .
Ag@@ assi won the final four of their matches , with the last being in 2003 at the Miami Open with Chang being clearly after his prime .
</p>
<p>
Boris Becker and Ag@@ assi played 14 times with Ag@@ assi leading 10 @-@ 4 .
Becker dominated the rivalry early on , winning their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before Ag@@ assi turned the rivalry in 1990 , and won 10 of their last 11 matches .
they first played at Indian Wells in 1988 , with Becker prevailing .
their most notable match was the 1989 Davis Cup semi@@ final match , which Becker won in five sets after losing the first two in ti@@ e@@ breaks .
Ag@@ assi , considered a basel@@ iner with a playing style not su@@ iting grass , shocked Becker , a three @-@ time champion , in a five set quarter@@ final at Wim@@ bled@@ on in 1992 on his way to his first Grand S@@ lam title .
the intensity of the rivalry peaked in 1995 .
Becker won that year &apos;s Wim@@ bled@@ on semi@@ final after being down a set and two breaks , to eventually win in four sets .
in a highly anticipated re@@ match in the US Open semi@@ final , this time it was Ag@@ assi who came out victorious in four tight sets .
their final match was played at Hong Kong in 1999 , which Ag@@ assi won in three sets .
</p>
<p>
Ag@@ assi and Pat R@@ after played fifteen times with Ag@@ assi leading 10 @-@ 5 .
the rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters , because of the players &apos; contrasting styles of play , with R@@ after using traditional serve &amp; volley methods against Ag@@ assi &apos;s variety of return of serves and passing shots as main weapons .
Ag@@ assi led 8 @-@ 2 on hard courts , but R@@ after surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the 1999 Rome Masters .
they played four matches at Wim@@ bled@@ on with both winning two matches each .
Ag@@ assi won the first two in 1993 and 1999 , while R@@ after took their 2000 and 2001 encounters , both the gru@@ elling 5 @-@ set@@ ters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played .
Ag@@ assi also won both their meetings at the Australian Open , in 1995 and 2001 , on his way to the title in both occasions .
R@@ after however took their only US Open encounter in 1997 and went on to win the title .
</p>
<p>
Ag@@ assi and Roger Feder@@ er played 11 times , and Feder@@ er led their head @-@ to @-@ head series 8 @-@ 3 .
with the retirement of Sam@@ pr@@ as , the rivalry against 11 years younger Feder@@ er , who was another great server like Sam@@ pr@@ as , became Ag@@ assi &apos;s main rivalry for the final years of his career .
Ag@@ assi won their first three matches , but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones .
they first met in just the third tournament of Feder@@ er &apos;s career at the 1998 Swiss In@@ doors in Feder@@ er &apos;s hometown , with Ag@@ assi prevailing over the 17 @-@ year @-@ old .
Ag@@ assi also defeated Feder@@ er at the 2001 US Open and the finals of the Miami Open in 2002 .
Feder@@ er began to turn the tide at the Masters Cup in 2003 , when he defeated Ag@@ assi in both the round rob@@ in and the final .
they played a memorable quarter@@ final match at the 2004 US Open that spanned over two windy days , with Feder@@ er eventually prevailing in five sets .
at the 2005 Dubai Championships , Feder@@ er and Ag@@ assi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helip@@ ad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel Bur@@ j al @-@ Arab .
their final duel took place in the final of the 2005 US Open .

</p>
<p>
early in his career , Ag@@ assi would look to end points quickly by playing first @-@ strike tennis , typically by inducing a weak return with a deep , hard shot , and then playing a winner at an extreme angle .
his ground@@ strokes , return of serve , baseline game , anticipation , and eye @-@ hand coordination were always among the best in the game .
on the rare occasion that he charged the net , Ag@@ assi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner .
his favored ground@@ stroke was his flat , accurate two @-@ handed back@@ hand , hit well cross @-@ court but especially down the line .
his fore@@ hand was nearly as strong , especially his inside @-@ out to the ad court .
Ag@@ assi &apos;s strength was in dict@@ ating play from the back of the court .
while he was growing up , his father and Nick Bol@@ let@@ ti@@ eri trained him in this way .
when in control of a point , Ag@@ assi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors , and to make his opponent run more .
this change to more methodical , less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach , Brad Gilbert , in their first year together in 1994 .
Gilbert encouraged Ag@@ assi to wear out opponents with his deep , flat ground@@ strokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars , and noted Ag@@ assi &apos;s two @-@ handed back@@ hand down the line as his very best shot .
a signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the de@@ uce court after deep penetrating ground@@ strokes .
this would often be followed by a passing shot or lo@@ b if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it .
Ag@@ assi was raised on hard@@ courts , but found much of his early major @-@ tournament success on the red clay of Roland Gar@@ ros , reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career .
despite grass being his worst surface , his first major win was at the slick grass of Wim@@ bled@@ on in 1992 , a tournament that he professed to h@@ ating at the time .
his strongest surface over the course of his career , was indeed hard@@ court , where he won six of his eight majors .

according to the introduction to the latest edition of his science fiction novel &quot; Bra@@ ve New World &quot; , the experience he had there of &quot; an ordered universe in a world of plan@@ less incoherence &quot; was an important source for the novel .
</p>
<p>
Hu@@ x@@ ley completed his first novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early twenties , establishing himself as a successful writer and social sati@@ rist .
his first published novels were social sati@@ res , &quot; C@@ rome Yellow &quot; , &quot; An@@ tic H@@ ay &quot; , &quot; Those B@@ arren Le@@ aves &quot; , and &quot; Point Counter Point &quot; . &quot;
brave New World &quot; was his fifth novel and first dy@@ stop@@ ian work .
in the 1920s he was also a contributor to &quot; V@@ anity Fair &quot; and British &quot; Vo@@ gue &quot; magazines .
</p>
<p>
during the First World War , Hu@@ x@@ ley spent much of his time at Gar@@ sing@@ ton Man@@ or near Oxford , home of Lady Ot@@ t@@ oline Mor@@ rell , working as a farm labourer .
there he met several Bloom@@ s@@ bury Group figures , including Bertrand Russell , Alfred North White@@ head , and Clive Bell .
later , in &quot; C@@ rome Yellow &quot; he car@@ ic@@ at@@ ured the Gar@@ sing@@ ton lifestyle .
jobs were very scarce , but in 1919 John Middleton Mur@@ ry was re@@ organising the &quot; Ath@@ en@@ a@@ eum &quot; and invited Hu@@ x@@ ley to join the staff .
he accepted immediately , and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria N@@ ys , also at Gar@@ sing@@ ton .
they lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s , where Hu@@ x@@ ley would visit his friend D. H. Lawrence .
following Lawrence &apos;s death in 1930 , Hu@@ x@@ ley edited Lawrence &apos;s letters .
works of this period included important novels on the dehuman@@ ising aspects of scientific progress , most famously &quot; Bra@@ ve New World &quot; , and on pacif@@ ist themes .
in &quot; Bra@@ ve New World &quot; , set in a dy@@ stop@@ ian London , Hu@@ x@@ ley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and Pav@@ lo@@ vian conditioning .
Hu@@ x@@ ley was strongly influenced by F. Mat@@ thi@@ as Alexander , and included him as a character in &quot; Ey@@ eless in Gaza &quot; .
beginning in this period , Hu@@ x@@ ley began to write and edit non @-@ fiction works on pacif@@ ist issues , including &quot; En@@ ds and Means &quot; , &quot; An En@@ cycl@@ opedia of Pac@@ if@@ ism &quot; , and &quot; Pac@@ if@@ ism and Philosophy &quot; , and was an active member of the Peace Pledge Union .
</p>
<p>
in 1937 Hu@@ x@@ ley moved to Hollywood with his wife Maria , son Matthew Hu@@ x@@ ley , and friend Gerald Hear@@ d .
he lived in the U.S. , mainly in southern California , until his death , and also for a time in Ta@@ os , New Mexico , where he wrote &quot; En@@ ds and Means &quot; .
the book contains tracts on war , religion , nationalism and ethics .
heard introduced Hu@@ x@@ ley to V@@ ed@@ anta , meditation , and veget@@ arianism through the principle of a@@ him@@ sa .
in 1938 , Hu@@ x@@ ley be@@ fri@@ ended J@@ id@@ du Krish@@ nam@@ ur@@ ti , whose teachings he greatly admired .
Hu@@ x@@ ley and Krish@@ nam@@ ur@@ ti entered into an enduring exchange over many years , with Krish@@ nam@@ ur@@ ti representing the more ra@@ re@@ fied , detached , ivory @-@ tower perspective and Hu@@ x@@ ley , with his pragmatic concerns , the more socially and historically informed position .
Hu@@ x@@ ley provided an introduction to Krish@@ nam@@ ur@@ ti &apos;s quint@@ essential statement , &quot; The First and Last Freedom &quot; .
Hu@@ x@@ ley also became a V@@ ed@@ anti@@ st in the circle of Hindu Sw@@ ami Pra@@ b@@ ha@@ van@@ anda , and introduced Christopher I@@ sher@@ wood to this circle .
not long afterward , Hu@@ x@@ ley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas , &quot; The Per@@ ennial Philosophy &quot; , which discussed the teachings of renowned mys@@ tics of the world .
Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted &quot; five senses &quot; and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfac@@ tions and senti@@ ment@@ alities .
Hu@@ x@@ ley became a close friend of Rem@@ sen Bird , president of Occidental College .
he spent much time at the college , which is in the Eagle Rock neighbourhood of Los Angeles .
the college appears as &quot; Tar@@ z@@ ana College &quot; in his sati@@ rical novel &quot; After Many a Summer &quot; .
the novel won Hu@@ x@@ ley a British literary award , the 1939 James Ta@@ it Black Memorial Prize for fiction .
Hu@@ x@@ ley also incorporated Bird into the novel .
during this period , Hu@@ x@@ ley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screen@@ writer ;
Christopher I@@ sher@@ wood , in his autobiography &quot; My G@@ uru and His Dis@@ ci@@ ple &quot; , states that Hu@@ x@@ ley earned more than $ 3,000 per week as a screen@@ writer , and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left @-@ wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler &apos;s Germany to the US .
in March 1938 , Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s friend Anita Loo@@ s , a novelist and screen@@ writer , put him in touch with Metro @-@ Gold@@ w@@ yn @-@ May@@ er , which hired him for &quot; Madame Curie &quot; which was originally to star Gret@@ a Gar@@ bo and be directed by George C@@ uk@@ or .
Hu@@ x@@ ley received screen credit for &quot; Pride and Pre@@ jud@@ ice &quot; and was paid for his work on a number of other films , including &quot; Jane Ey@@ re &quot; .
he was commissioned by Walt Disney in 1945 to write a script based on &quot; Alice &apos;s Ad@@ ventures in Won@@ der@@ land &quot; and the biography of the story &apos;s author , Lewis Car@@ roll .
the script was not used , however .
Hu@@ x@@ ley wrote an introduction to the pos@@ thum@@ ous publication of J. D. Un@@ win &apos;s 1940 book &quot; Hop@@ ou@@ sia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society &quot; .
on 21 October 1949 , Hu@@ x@@ ley wrote to George Or@@ well , author of &quot; Nine@@ teen Eigh@@ ty @-@ Four &quot; , congratulating him on &quot; how fine and how profoundly important the book is . &quot; in his letter to Or@@ well , he predicted :
within the next generation I believe that the world &apos;s leaders will discover that infant conditioning and are more efficient , as instruments of government , than clubs and prisons , and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience .
Hu@@ x@@ ley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself .
from these , he made some warnings in his writings and talks .
in a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist Mike Wallace , Hu@@ x@@ ley outlined several major concerns : the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation ; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation ; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion ; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well @-@ marketed commodities .
</p>
<p>
in 1953 , Hu@@ x@@ ley and Maria applied for United States citizenship and presented themselves for examination .
when Hu@@ x@@ ley refused to bear arms for the U.S. and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals , the only excuse allowed under the McCar@@ ran Act , the judge had to adjourn the proceedings .
he withdrew his application .
nevertheless , he remained in the U.S. In 1959 Hu@@ x@@ ley turned down an offer of a Knight Bachelor by the Mac@@ mill@@ an government without putting forward a reason ; his brother Julian had been kn@@ ighted in 1958 , while another brother Andrew would be kn@@ ighted in 1974 .
</p>
<p>
beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963 , Hu@@ x@@ ley had an extensive association with the V@@ ed@@ anta Society of Southern California , founded and headed by Sw@@ ami Pra@@ b@@ ha@@ van@@ anda .
together with Gerald Hear@@ d , Christopher I@@ sher@@ wood and other followers , he was initiated by the Sw@@ ami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices .
in 1944 , Hu@@ x@@ ley wrote the introduction to the &quot; Bhag@@ av@@ ad G@@ ita : the Song of God , &quot; translated by Sw@@ ami Pra@@ b@@ ha@@ van@@ anda and Christopher I@@ sher@@ wood , which was published by the V@@ ed@@ anta Society of Southern California .
from 1941 until 1960 , Hu@@ x@@ ley contributed 48 articles to &quot; V@@ ed@@ anta and the West &quot; , published by the society .
he also served on the editorial board with I@@ sher@@ wood , Hear@@ d , and play@@ wright John Van Dru@@ ten from 1951 through 1962 .
Hu@@ x@@ ley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara V@@ ed@@ anta temples .
two of those lectures have been released on CD :
&quot; knowledge and Understanding &quot; and &quot; Who Are We ? &quot; from 1955 .
nonetheless , Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s ag@@ no@@ stic@@ ism , together with his speculative propensity , made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institution@@ alised religion .
</p>
<p>
in the spring of 1953 , Hu@@ x@@ ley had his first experience with the psych@@ ed@@ elic drug m@@ escal@@ ine .
Hu@@ x@@ ley had initiated a correspondence with Doctor Humph@@ ry Os@@ mond , a British psychiatrist then employed in a Canadian institution , and eventually asked him to supply a dose of m@@ escal@@ ine ;
Os@@ mond obliged and supervised Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s session in southern California .
after the publication of &quot; The Do@@ ors of Perc@@ eption &quot; , in which he recounted this experience , Hu@@ x@@ ley and Sw@@ ami Pra@@ b@@ ha@@ van@@ anda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psych@@ ed@@ elic drug experience , which may have caused the relationship to cool , but Hu@@ x@@ ley continued to write articles for the society &apos;s journal , lecture at the temple , and attend social functions .
Hu@@ x@@ ley later had an experience on L@@ SD that he considered more profound than those detailed in The Do@@ ors of Perc@@ eption .
Hu@@ x@@ ley wrote that &quot; &quot; The mystical experience is doubly valuable ; it is valuable because it gives the experi@@ encer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less self @-@ centered and more creative life . &quot; &quot;
</p>
<p>
differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s eyesight at specific points in his life .
in about 1939 Hu@@ x@@ ley encountered the B@@ ates method for better eyesight , and a teacher , Margaret Dar@@ st Cor@@ bet@@ t , who was able to teach the method to him .
in 1940 , Hu@@ x@@ ley relocated from Hollywood to a &quot; ran@@ chi@@ to &quot; in the high desert ham@@ let of L@@ lan@@ o , California , in northern Los Angeles County .
Hu@@ x@@ ley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the B@@ ates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert .
he reported that , for the first time in more than 25 years , he was able to read without glasses and without strain .
he even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch .
he wrote a book about his successes with the B@@ ates Method , &quot; The Art of See@@ ing &quot; , which was published in 1942 , 1943 .
the book contained some generally disputed theories , and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s eyesight .
it was , and is , widely believed that Hu@@ x@@ ley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens , despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford .
for example , some ten years after publication of &quot; The Art of See@@ ing &quot; , in 1952 , Bennett Cer@@ f was present when Hu@@ x@@ ley spoke at a Hollywood banquet , wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lec@@ tern without difficulty :
&quot; I can hardly see at all . and I don &apos;t give a damn , really . &quot; Ribeiro then proceeds to confirm Bennett Cer@@ f &apos;s experience , as described above .
on the other hand , Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s second wife , Laura Arch@@ era , would later emphasise in her biographical account , &quot; This Tim@@ eless Mom@@ ent &quot; :
&quot; one of the great achievements of his life : that of having regained his sight . &quot; after revealing a letter she wrote to the &quot; Los Angeles Times &quot; dis@@ claiming the label of Hu@@ x@@ ley as a &quot; poor fellow who can hardly see &quot; by Walter C. Alvarez , she tempered this :
&quot; although I feel it was an injustice to treat Al@@ d@@ ous as though he were blind , it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision . for instance , although Al@@ d@@ ous did not wear glasses , he would quite often use a magnifying lens . &quot; Laura Hu@@ x@@ ley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s vision .
her account , in this respect , is discerni@@ bly congruent with the following sample of Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s own words from &quot; The Art of See@@ ing &quot; :
&quot; the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism , or any part of the organism , is that it is not constant , but highly variable . &quot; nevertheless , the topic of Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s eyesight continues to endure similar , significant controversy , regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear .
American popular science author Steven Johnson , in his book &quot; Mind Wide Open &quot; , quotes Hu@@ x@@ ley about his difficulties with visual encoding :
&quot; I am and , for as long as I can remember , I have always been a poor visu@@ alizer . words , even the pregnant words of poets , do not evoke pictures in my mind . no hyp@@ n@@ agog@@ ic visions greet me on the verge of sleep . when I recall something , the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object . by an effort of the will , I can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon .... &quot;
</p>

Hu@@ x@@ ley married Maria N@@ ys , a Belgian he met at Gar@@ sing@@ ton , Ox@@ ford@@ shire , in 1919 .
they had one child , Matthew Hu@@ x@@ ley , who had a career as an author , anthropologist , and prominent epidemi@@ ologist .
in 1955 , Maria Hu@@ x@@ ley died of cancer .
in 1956 , Hu@@ x@@ ley married Laura Arch@@ era , also an author , as well as a violinist and psycho@@ therapist .
she wrote &quot; This Tim@@ eless Mom@@ ent &quot; , a biography of Hu@@ x@@ ley .
she told the story of their marriage through Mary Ann Bra@@ ub@@ ach &apos;s 2010 documentary , &quot; Hu@@ x@@ ley on Hu@@ x@@ ley &quot; .
Hu@@ x@@ ley was diagnosed with laryn@@ geal cancer in 1960 ; in the years that followed , with his health deteriorating , he wrote the Utop@@ ian novel &quot; Island &quot; , and gave lectures on &quot; Human Pot@@ enti@@ alities &quot; both at the University of California &apos;s San Francisco Medical Center and at the E@@ sal@@ en Institute .
these lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the Human Potential Movement .
Hu@@ x@@ ley was a close friend of J@@ id@@ du Krish@@ nam@@ ur@@ ti and Ro@@ sal@@ ind Raj@@ ag@@ op@@ al and was involved in the creation of the Happy Valley School , now Bes@@ ant Hill School of Happy Valley , in Oj@@ ai , California .
the most substantial collection of Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s few remaining papers , following the destruction of most in a fire , is at the Library of the University of California , Los Angeles .
some are also at the Stanford University Libraries .
on 9 April 1962 , Hu@@ x@@ ley was informed he was elected Compan@@ ion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature , the senior literary organisation in Britain , and he accepted the title via letter on 28 April 1962 .
the correspondence between Hu@@ x@@ ley and the society are kept at the Cambridge University Library .
the society invited Hu@@ x@@ ley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at Som@@ er@@ set House , London in June 1963 .
Hu@@ x@@ ley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society ; however , his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend .
</p>
<p>
on his death@@ bed , unable to speak owing to advanced laryn@@ geal cancer , Hu@@ x@@ ley made a written request to his wife Laura for &quot; L@@ SD , 100 µ@@ g , intra@@ muscular . &quot; according to her account of his death in &quot; This Tim@@ eless Mom@@ ent &quot; , she obliged with an injection at 11 : 20 a.m. and a second dose an hour later ; Hu@@ x@@ ley died aged 69 , at 5 : 20 p.m. , on 22 November 1963 .
media coverage of Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s death , along with that of the author C. S. Lewis , was overshadowed by the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy on the same day .
in an article for &quot; New York &quot; magazine titled &quot; The E@@ clip@@ sed Celebr@@ ity Death Club , &quot; Christopher Bon@@ anos wrote , The championship trophy for badly timed death , though , goes to a pair of British writers .
Al@@ d@@ ous Hu@@ x@@ ley , the author of &quot; Bra@@ ve New World &quot; , died the same day as C. S. Lewis , who wrote the &quot; Chron@@ icles of Nar@@ nia &quot; series .
unfortunately for both of their legacies , that day was November 22 , 1963 , just as John Kennedy &apos;s motor@@ cade passed the Texas School Book Depos@@ itory .
Hu@@ x@@ ley , at least , made it interesting : at his request , his wife shot him up with L@@ SD a couple of hours before the end , and he tripped his way out of this world .
this coincidence served as the basis for Peter Kre@@ eft &apos;s book &quot; Between Heaven and Hell : a Di@@ alog Some@@ where Beyond Death with John F. Kennedy , C. S. Lewis , &amp; Al@@ d@@ ous Hu@@ x@@ ley &quot; , which imag@@ ines a conversation among the three men taking place in Pur@@ g@@ atory following their deaths .
Hu@@ x@@ ley &apos;s memorial service took place in London in December 1963 ; it was led by his elder brother Julian .
on 27 October 1971 his ashes were inter@@ red in the family grave at the Watts Cemetery , home of the Watts Mor@@ tuary Chap@@ el in Comp@@ ton , Guil@@ d@@ ford , Surrey , England .
Hu@@ x@@ ley had been a long @-@ time friend of Russian composer Igor Stra@@ vin@@ sky , who later dedicated his last orchestr@@ al composition to Hu@@ x@@ ley .
Stra@@ vin@@ sky began &quot; Vari@@ ations &quot; in Santa F@@ é , New Mexico , in July 1963 , and completed the composition in Hollywood on 28 October 1964 .
it was first performed in Chicago on 17 April 1965 , by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Craft .

Andrei Arsen@@ y@@ evich Tar@@ kov@@ sky was a Russian film@@ maker , writer , film editor , film theor@@ ist , theatre and opera director .
his work is characterized by un@@ conventionally long takes , sparse dramatic structure , poetic imagery , and spiritual and metaphysical themes .
he has been called a progen@@ itor of slow cinema .
Director Ing@@ mar Berg@@ man said of him : Tar@@ kov@@ sky for me is the greatest , the one who invented a new language , true to the nature of film , as it captures life as a reflection , life as a dream .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s films include &quot; Ivan &apos;s Childhood &quot; , &quot; Andrei R@@ ubl@@ ev &quot; , &quot; Sol@@ aris &quot; , &quot; Mirror &quot; , and &quot; Stal@@ ker &quot; .
he directed the first five of his seven feature films in the Soviet Union ; his last two films , &quot; No@@ stal@@ gh@@ ia &quot; and &quot; The Sac@@ rif@@ ice &quot; , were produced in Italy and Sweden , respectively .
the films &quot; Andrei R@@ ubl@@ ev &quot; , &quot; Sol@@ aris &quot; , &quot; Mirror &quot; , and &quot; Stal@@ ker &quot; are regularly listed among the greatest films of all time .
</p>
<p>
Andrei Tar@@ kov@@ sky was born in the village of Z@@ av@@ raz@@ hy@@ e in the Y@@ ur@@ y@@ ev@@ et@@ sky District of the Ivan@@ ovo Industrial O@@ blast to the poet and translator Arsen@@ y Alexand@@ ro@@ vich Tar@@ kov@@ sky , a native of Yel@@ is@@ av@@ et@@ grad , K@@ her@@ son Governorate , and Maria Ivan@@ ova V@@ ish@@ ny@@ akova , a graduate of the Max@@ im Gor@@ ky Literature Institute who later worked as a correc@@ tor ; she was born in Moscow in the Dub@@ as@@ ov family estate .
Andrei &apos;s paternal grandfather Alek@@ sandr Kar@@ lov@@ ich Tar@@ kov@@ sky was a Polish nobl@@ eman who worked as a bank clerk .
his wife Maria Dan@@ il@@ ovna Rach@@ kov@@ skaya was a Romanian teacher who arrived from I@@ a@@ ș@@ i .
Andrei &apos;s maternal grandmother Vera Nikol@@ a@@ ev@@ na V@@ ish@@ ny@@ akova belonged to an old Dub@@ as@@ ov family of Russian nobility that traces its history back to the 17th century ; among her relatives was Admiral F@@ y@@ odor Dub@@ as@@ ov , a fact she had to conceal during the Soviet days .
she was married to Ivan Ivan@@ ovich V@@ ish@@ ny@@ akov , a native of the Kal@@ uga Governorate who studied law at the Moscow University and served as a judge in Koz@@ el@@ sk .
according to the family legend , Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s ancestors on his father &apos;s side were princes from the Sham@@ k@@ hal@@ ate of Tar@@ ki , Dag@@ estan , although his sister Marina Tar@@ kov@@ skaya who did a detailed research on their geneal@@ ogy called it &quot; a myth , even a prank of sorts , &quot; stressing that none of the documents confirms this version .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky spent his childhood in Y@@ ur@@ y@@ ev@@ ets .
he was described by childhood friends as active and popular , having many friends and being typically in the center of action .
his father left the family in 1937 , subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941 .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky stayed with his mother , moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow , where she worked as a proof@@ reader at a printing press .
in 1939 Tar@@ kov@@ sky enrolled at the Moscow School No. 554 .
during the war , the three evacuated to Y@@ ur@@ y@@ ev@@ ets , living with his maternal grandmother .
in 1943 the family returned to Moscow .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky continued his studies at his old school , where the poet Andrey Vo@@ z@@ nes@@ en@@ sky was one of his classmates .
he studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school .
the family lived on Sh@@ chi@@ pok Street in the Zam@@ o@@ sk@@ vor@@ ec@@ hy@@ e District in Moscow .
from November 1947 to spring 1948 he was in the hospital with tuberculosis .
many themes of his childhood - the evacuation , his mother and her two children , the withdrawn father , the time in the hospital - feature prominently in his film &quot; Mirror &quot; .
in his school years , Tar@@ kov@@ sky was a troubl@@ emaker and a poor student .
he still managed to graduate , and from 1951 to 1952 studied Arabic at the Oriental Institute in Moscow , a branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR .
although he already spoke some Arabic and was a successful student in his first sem@@ esters , he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the Academy of Science Institute for Non @-@ Fer@@ rous Metals and Gold .
he participated in a year @-@ long research expedition to the river K@@ ure@@ ik@@ ye near Tur@@ uk@@ h@@ ansk in the Kras@@ no@@ yar@@ sk Province .
during this time in the ta@@ iga , Tar@@ kov@@ sky decided to study film .
</p>
<p>
upon returning from the research expedition in 1954 , Tar@@ kov@@ sky applied at the State Institute of Cin@@ em@@ atography and was admitted to the film @-@ directing program .
he was in the same class as Ir@@ ma Ra@@ ush whom he married in April 1957 .
the early Kh@@ rush@@ chev era offered good opportunities for young film directors .
before 1953 , annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors .
after 1953 , more films were produced , many of them by young directors .
the Kh@@ rush@@ chev Tha@@ w relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature , films and music .
this allowed Tar@@ kov@@ sky to see films of the Italian ne@@ ore@@ alists , French New Wave , and of directors such as Kuro@@ s@@ awa , Bu@@ ñ@@ uel , Berg@@ man , B@@ res@@ son , Andrzej W@@ aj@@ da and Miz@@ o@@ gu@@ chi .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s teacher and mentor was Mikhail Rom@@ m , who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors .
in 1956 Tar@@ kov@@ sky directed his first student short film , &quot; The K@@ illers &quot; , from a short story of Ernest Hemingway .
the short film &quot; There Will Be No Leave Today &quot; and the screen@@ play &quot; Concentr@@ ate &quot; followed in 1958 and 1959 .
an important influence on Tar@@ kov@@ sky was the film director G@@ rigor@@ i Ch@@ uk@@ hra@@ i , who was teaching at the V@@ GI@@ K .
impressed by the talent of his student , Ch@@ uk@@ hra@@ i offered Tar@@ kov@@ sky a position as assistant director for his film &quot; Clear Sk@@ ies &quot; .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects .
during his third year at the V@@ GI@@ K , Tar@@ kov@@ sky met Andrei Kon@@ chal@@ ovsky .
they found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films .
in 1959 they wrote the script &quot; Antarctica - Di@@ stant Country &quot; , which was later published in the &quot; Mo@@ sk@@ ov@@ sk@@ ij Kom@@ som@@ ol@@ ets &quot; .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky submitted the script to Len@@ film , but it was rejected .
they were more successful with the script &quot; The Ste@@ am@@ roller and the Viol@@ in &quot; , which they sold to Mos@@ film .
this became Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s graduation project , earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961 .
</p>
<p>
Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s first feature film was &quot; Ivan &apos;s Childhood &quot; in 1962 .
he had inherited the film from director Edu@@ ard A@@ bal@@ ov , who had to abort the project .
the film earned Tar@@ kov@@ sky international acclaim and won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival in the year 1962 .
in the same year , on 30 September , his first son Arsen@@ y Tar@@ kov@@ sky was born .
in 1965 , he directed the film &quot; Andrei R@@ ubl@@ ev &quot; about the life of Andrei R@@ ubl@@ ev , the fifteenth @-@ century Russian icon painter . &quot;
Andrei R@@ ubl@@ ev &quot; was not , except for a single screening in Moscow in 1966 , immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky had to cut the film several times , resulting in several different versions of varying lengths .
the film was widely released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971 .
he divorced his wife , Ir@@ ma Ra@@ ush , in June 1970 .
in the same year , he married Lar@@ issa K@@ iz@@ il@@ ova , who had been a production assistant for the film &quot; Andrei R@@ ubl@@ ev &quot; .
their son , Andrei Andre@@ y@@ evich Tar@@ kov@@ sky , was born in the same year on 7 August .
a version of the film was presented at the Cannes Film Festival in 1969 and won the FI@@ PRES@@ CI prize .
in 1972 , he completed &quot; Sol@@ aris &quot; , an adaptation of the novel &quot; Sol@@ aris &quot; by Stan@@ is@@ ł@@ aw L@@ em .
he had worked on this together with screen@@ writer Fri@@ dri@@ kh Gor@@ en@@ sh@@ te@@ in as early as 1968 .
the film was presented at the Cannes Film Festival , won the Grand Prix Sp@@ é@@ cial du J@@ ury and the FI@@ PRES@@ CI prize , and was nominated for the Pal@@ me d &apos;@@ Or .
from 1973 to 1974 , he shot the film &quot; Mirror &quot; , a highly autobi@@ ographical and un@@ conventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father &apos;s poems .
in this film Tar@@ kov@@ sky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky had worked on the screen@@ play for this film since 1967 , under the consecutive titles &quot; Conf@@ ession &quot; , &quot; White day &quot; and &quot; A white , white day &quot; .
from the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived eliti@@ st nature .
Russian authorities placed the film in the &quot; third category , &quot; a severely limited distribution , and only allowed it to be shown in third @-@ class cinemas and workers &apos; clubs .
few prints were made and the film @-@ makers received no returns .
third category films also placed the film @-@ makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds , which could have serious effects on their future productivity .
these difficulties are presumed to have made Tar@@ kov@@ sky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the Soviet film industry .
during 1975 , Tar@@ kov@@ sky also worked on the screen@@ play &quot; Hoff@@ man@@ ni@@ ana &quot; , about the German writer and poet E. T. A. Hoffmann .
in December 1976 , he directed &quot; Hamlet &quot; , his only stage play , at the Len@@ k@@ om Theatre in Moscow .
the main role was played by Anatol@@ y Sol@@ on@@ it@@ syn , who also acted in several of Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s films .
at the end of 1978 , he also wrote the screen@@ play &quot; S@@ ard@@ or &quot; together with the writer Alek@@ sandr M@@ ish@@ arin .
the last film Tar@@ kov@@ sky completed in the Soviet Union was &quot; Stal@@ ker &quot; , inspired by the novel &quot; Road@@ side Pic@@ nic &quot; by the brothers Ark@@ ady and Boris Str@@ ug@@ at@@ sky .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986 .
initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel &quot; Dead Moun@@ tain@@ eer &apos;s Hotel &quot; and he developed a raw script .
influenced by a discussion with Ark@@ ady Str@@ ug@@ at@@ sky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on &quot; Road@@ side Pic@@ nic &quot; .
work on this film began in 1976 .
the production was mired in troubles ; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s relationship with cinem@@ at@@ ographer Geor@@ gy R@@ er@@ berg deteriorated to the point where he hired Alexander Kn@@ y@@ az@@ hin@@ sky as a new first cinem@@ at@@ ographer .
furthermore , Tar@@ kov@@ sky suffered a heart attack in April 1978 , resulting in further delay .
the film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecu@@ menical J@@ ury at the Cannes Film Festival .
in the same year Tar@@ kov@@ sky also began the production of the film &quot; The First Day &quot; , based on a script by his friend and long @-@ term collabor@@ ator Andrei Kon@@ chal@@ ovsky .
the film was set in 18th @-@ century Russia during the reign of Peter the Great and star@@ red Nat@@ alya Bon@@ d@@ arch@@ uk and Anatol@@ i Pap@@ anov .
to get the project approved by Go@@ sk@@ ino , Tar@@ kov@@ sky submitted a script that was different from the original script , omitting several scenes that were critical of the official athe@@ ism in the Soviet Union .
after shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Go@@ sk@@ ino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the cens@@ ors .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky was reportedly infuri@@ ated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film .

<p>
during the summer of 1979 , Tar@@ kov@@ sky traveled to Italy , where he shot the documentary &quot; Voy@@ age in Time &quot; together with his long @-@ time friend Ton@@ ino Gu@@ erra .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky returned to Italy in 1980 for an extended trip during which he and Gu@@ erra completed the script for the film &quot; No@@ stal@@ gh@@ ia &quot; .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky returned to Italy in 1982 to start shooting &quot; No@@ stal@@ gh@@ ia &quot; .
he did not return to his home country .
as Mos@@ film withdrew from the project , he had to complete the film with financial support provided by the Italian RA@@ I .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky completed the film in 1983 . &quot;
No@@ stal@@ gh@@ ia &quot; was presented at the Cannes Film Festival and won the FI@@ PRES@@ CI prize and the Prize of the Ecu@@ menical J@@ ury .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky also shared a special prize called &quot; Grand Prix du cin@@ é@@ ma de creation &quot; with Robert B@@ res@@ son .
Soviet authorities prevented the film from winning the Pal@@ me d &apos;@@ Or , a fact that hardened Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s resolve to never work in the Soviet Union again .
he also said : &quot; &quot; I am not a Soviet dissident , I have no conflict with the Soviet Government . &quot;
&quot; but if he returned home , he added , &apos; I would be unemployed . &apos;
in the same year , he also staged the opera &quot; Boris Go@@ dun@@ ov &quot; at the Royal Opera House in London under the musical direction of Claudio Ab@@ bad@@ o .
he spent most of 1984 preparing the film &quot; The Sac@@ rif@@ ice &quot; .
at a press conference in Milan on 10 July 1984 , he announced that he would never return to the Soviet Union and would remain in Europe .
at that time , his son Andrei J@@ r. was still in the Soviet Union and not allowed to leave the country .
on 28 August 1985 , Tar@@ kov@@ sky arrived at Latin@@ a Refugee Camp in Latin@@ a , where he was registered with the serial number 13@@ 225 / 379 .
&quot; the Sac@@ rif@@ ice &quot; was Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s ultimate film , dedicated to Andrei Jr .
in the subsequent documentary following the making of The Sac@@ rif@@ ice , released pos@@ thum@@ ously , Tar@@ kov@@ sky expresses his sentiments on death , claiming he believed himself to be immortal .
</p>
<p>
during 1985 , he shot the film &quot; The Sac@@ rif@@ ice &quot; in Sweden .
at the end of the year he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer .
in January 1986 , he began treatment in Paris and was joined there by his son , who was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union . &quot;
the Sac@@ rif@@ ice &quot; was presented at the Cannes Film Festival and received the Grand Prix Sp@@ é@@ cial du J@@ ury , the FI@@ PRES@@ CI prize and the Prize of the Ecu@@ menical J@@ ury .
as Tar@@ kov@@ sky was unable to attend due to his illness , the prizes were collected by his son , Andrei Jr .
in Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s last entry , he wrote : &quot; but now I have no strength left - that is the problem . &quot; the diaries are sometimes also known as &quot; &quot; and were published pos@@ thum@@ ously in 1989 and in English in 1991 .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky died in Paris on 29 December 1986 .
his funeral ceremony was held at the Alexander Nev@@ sky Cathedral .
he was buried on 3 January 1987 in the Russian Cemetery in Sain@@ te @-@ Gen@@ evi@@ è@@ ve @-@ des @-@ Bo@@ is in France .
the inscription on his grav@@ estone , which was conceived by Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s wife , Lar@@ isa Tar@@ kov@@ skaya , reads :
&quot; to the man who saw the Angel &quot; .
a conspiracy theory emerged in Russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that Tar@@ kov@@ sky did not die of natural causes but was assassinated by the KGB .
evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that Viktor Che@@ bri@@ kov gave the order to eradicate Tar@@ kov@@ sky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as anti @-@ Soviet propaganda by Tar@@ kov@@ sky .
other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the 1991 coup and the claim by one of Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause .
as with Tar@@ kov@@ sky , his wife Lar@@ isa Tar@@ kov@@ skaya and actor Anatol@@ i Sol@@ on@@ it@@ syn all died from the very same type of lung cancer .
Vladimir Shar@@ un , sound designer in &quot; Stal@@ ker &quot; , is convinced that they were all poisoned by the chemical plant where they were shooting the film .

<p>
Tar@@ kov@@ sky is mainly known as a film director .
during his career he directed only seven feature films , as well as three shorts from his time at V@@ GI@@ K .
these include : he also wrote several screen@@ plays .
furthermore , he directed the play &quot; Hamlet &quot; for the stage in Moscow , directed the opera &quot; Boris Go@@ dun@@ ov &quot; in London , and he directed a radio production of the short story &quot; Tur@@ n@@ about &quot; by William Fa@@ ul@@ k@@ ner .
he also wrote &quot; S@@ culp@@ ting in Time &quot; , a book on film theory .

his last film &quot; The Sac@@ rif@@ ice &quot; was produced in Sweden in 1986 .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky was personally involved in writing the screen@@ plays for all his films , sometimes with a co@@ writer .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky once said that a director who realizes somebody else &apos;s screen@@ play without being involved in it becomes a mere illustr@@ ator , resulting in dead and monotonous films .
a book of 60 photos , &quot; In@@ stant Light , Tar@@ kov@@ sky Pol@@ ar@@ oids &quot; , taken by Tar@@ kov@@ sky in Russia and Italy between 1979 and 1984 was published in 2006 .
the collection was selected by Italian photographer Giovanni Chi@@ ar@@ am@@ on@@ te and Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s son Andrey A. Tar@@ kov@@ sky .

Tar@@ kov@@ sky has been the subject of several documentaries .
most notable is the 1988 documentary &quot; Moscow E@@ leg@@ y &quot; , by Russian film director Alexander Sok@@ uro@@ v .
Sok@@ uro@@ v &apos;s own work has been heavily influenced by Tar@@ kov@@ sky .
the film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s films . &quot;

&quot; concentrate &quot; is a never @-@ filmed 1958 screen@@ play by Russian film director Andrei Tar@@ kov@@ sky .
the screen@@ play is based on Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s year in the ta@@ iga as a member of a research expedition , prior to his enrollment in film school .
it &apos;s about the leader of a geological expedition , who waits for the boat that brings back the concentrates collected by the expedition .
the expedition is surrounded by mystery , and its purpose is a state secret .
although some authors claim that the screen@@ play was filmed , according to Marina Tar@@ kov@@ skaya , Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s sister the screen@@ play was never filmed .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky wrote the screen@@ play during his entrance examination at the State Institute of Cin@@ em@@ atography in a single sitting .
he earned the highest possible grade , excellent for this work .
in 1994 fragments of the &quot; Concentr@@ ate &quot; were filmed and used in the documentary &quot; Andrei Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s Ta@@ iga Summer &quot; by Marina Tar@@ kov@@ skaya and Alek@@ sandr Gordon .
</p>
<p>
&quot; Hoff@@ man@@ ni@@ ana &quot; is a never @-@ filmed 1974 screen@@ play by Russian film director Andrei Tar@@ kov@@ sky .
the screen@@ play is based on the life and work of German author E. T. A. Hoffmann .
in 1974 an acquaintance from Tall@@ inn@@ film approached Tar@@ kov@@ sky to write a screen@@ play on a German theme .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky considered Thomas Man@@ n and E.@@ T.@@ A. Hoffmann , and also thought about Ib@@ sen &apos;s &quot; Peer Gy@@ nt &quot; .
in the end Tar@@ kov@@ sky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of Hoffmann .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky planned to write the script during the summer of 1974 at his d@@ acha .
writing was not without difficulty , less than a month before the deadline he had not written a single page .
he finally finished the project in late 1974 and submitted the final script to Tall@@ inn@@ film in October .
although the script was well received by the officials at Tall@@ inn@@ film , it was the consensus that no one but Tar@@ kov@@ sky would be able to direct it .
the script was sent to Go@@ sk@@ ino in February 1976 , and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film the screen@@ play was never realized .
in 1984 , during the time of his exile in the West , Tar@@ kov@@ sky revisited the screen@@ play and made a few changes .
he also considered to finally direct a film based on the screen@@ play but ultimately dropped this idea .
</p>
<p>
Tar@@ kov@@ sky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s , a period referred to as the Kh@@ rush@@ chev Tha@@ w , during which Soviet society opened to foreign films , literature and music , among other things .
this allowed Tar@@ kov@@ sky to see films of European , American and Japanese directors , an experience which influenced his own film making .
his teacher and mentor at the film school , Mikhail Rom@@ m , allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky was , according to fellow student Sha@@ v@@ kat Abd@@ us@@ al@@ mov , fascinated by Japanese films .
he was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samu@@ rai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky has also expressed interest in the art of Hai@@ ku and its ability to create &quot; images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves . &quot; Tar@@ kov@@ sky perceived that the art of cinema has only been truly mastered by very few filmmakers , stating in a 1970 interview with Na@@ um Abra@@ mov that &quot; they can be counted on the fingers of one hand . &quot; in 1972 , Tar@@ kov@@ sky told film historian Leonid Koz@@ lov his ten favorite films .
the list includes : &quot; diary of a Country Pri@@ est &quot; and &quot; Mou@@ ch@@ ette &quot; by Robert B@@ res@@ son ;
&quot; winter Light &quot; , &quot; Wild Stra@@ w@@ berries &quot; , and &quot; Pers@@ ona &quot; by Ing@@ mar Berg@@ man ; &quot; Nazar@@ ín &quot; by Luis Bu@@ ñ@@ uel ; &quot; City Li@@ ghts &quot; by Charlie Chaplin ; &quot; U@@ get@@ su &quot; by Ken@@ ji Miz@@ o@@ gu@@ chi ;
&quot; seven Samu@@ rai &quot; by Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa , and &quot; Woman in the Dun@@ es &quot; by Hiro@@ shi T@@ esh@@ ig@@ a@@ hara .
among his favorite directors were Bu@@ ñ@@ uel , Miz@@ o@@ gu@@ chi , Berg@@ man , B@@ res@@ son , Kuro@@ s@@ awa , Michel@@ angelo Anton@@ ion@@ i , Jean V@@ igo , and Carl Theodor Dre@@ yer .
with the exception of &quot; City Li@@ ghts &quot; , the list does not contain any films of the early silent era .
the reason is that Tar@@ kov@@ sky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon , with the early film @-@ making forming only a prelude .
the list has also no films or directors from Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s native Russia , although he rated Soviet directors such as Boris Bar@@ net , Sergei Par@@ aj@@ anov and Alexander D@@ ov@@ z@@ henko highly .
</p>
<p>
in a 1962 interview , Tar@@ kov@@ sky argued , &quot; All art , of course , is intellectual , but for me , all the arts , and cinema even more so , must above all be emotional and act upon the heart . &quot; his films are characterized by metaphysical themes , extremely long takes , and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty .
recurring mo@@ tif@@ s are dreams , memory , childhood , running water accompanied by fire , rain indoors , reflections , lev@@ itation , and characters re @-@ appearing in the foreground of long p@@ anning movements of the camera .
he once said , &quot; Ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posing a person with an environment that is boundless , collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away , relating a person to the whole world , that is the meaning of cinema . &quot; Tar@@ kov@@ sky incorporated lev@@ itation scenes into several of his films , most notably &quot; Sol@@ aris &quot; .
to him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photo@@ genic value and magical inexpl@@ ic@@ ability .
water , clouds , and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photo@@ genic value , as well as their symbolism , such as waves or the forms of bro@@ oks or running water .
bells and candles are also frequent symbols .
these are symbols of film , sight and sound , and Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s film frequently has themes of self @-@ reflection .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky developed a theory of cinema that he called &quot; sculp@@ ting in time . &quot; by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it .
unedited movie footage transcri@@ bes time in real time .
by using long takes and few cuts in his films , he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing , time lost , and the relationship of one moment in time to another .
up to , and including , his film &quot; Mirror &quot; , Tar@@ kov@@ sky focused his cin@@ ematic works on exploring this theory .
after &quot; Mirror &quot; , he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic un@@ ities proposed by Aristotle : a concentrated action , happening in one place , within the span of a single day .
several of Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s films have color or black and white sequences .
this first occurs in the otherwise mono@@ chrome &quot; Andrei R@@ ubl@@ ev &quot; , which features a color epil@@ ogue of R@@ ubl@@ ev &apos;s authentic religious icon paintings .
all of his films afterwards contain mono@@ chrome , and in &quot; Stal@@ ker &apos;s &quot; case sep@@ ia sequences , while otherwise being in color .
in 1966 , in an interview conducted shortly after finishing &quot; Andrei R@@ ubl@@ ev &quot; , Tar@@ kov@@ sky dismissed color film as a &quot; commercial g@@ imm@@ ick &quot; and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color .
he claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time , and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments , but not all the time , as this distr@@ acts the viewer .
to him , films in color were like moving paintings or photographs , which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life .
Berg@@ man on Tar@@ kov@@ sky Ing@@ mar Berg@@ man , a renowned director , commented on Tar@@ kov@@ sky text = My discovery of Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s first film was like a miracle .
suddenly , I found myself standing at the door of a room the keys of which had until then , never been given to me .
it was a room I had always wanted to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease .
I felt encountered and stimulated : someone was expressing what I had always wanted to say without knowing how .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky is for me the greatest , the one who invented a new language , true to the nature of film , as it captures life as a reflection , life as a dream Contr@@ arily , however , Berg@@ man conceded the truth in the claim made by a critic who wrote that , &quot; with &quot; Autumn Son@@ ata &quot; Berg@@ man does Berg@@ man , &quot; adding , &quot; Tar@@ kov@@ sky began to make Tar@@ kov@@ sky films , and that F@@ ell@@ ini began to make F@@ ell@@ ini films &#91; ... &#93; Bu@@ ñ@@ uel nearly always made Bu@@ ñ@@ uel films . &quot; this pas@@ ti@@ che of one &apos;s own work has been derog@@ ator@@ ily termed as &quot; self @-@ karaoke . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Tar@@ kov@@ sky worked in close collaboration with cinem@@ at@@ ographer Vad@@ im Yus@@ ov from 1958 to 1972 , and much of the visual style of Tar@@ kov@@ sky &apos;s films can be attributed to this collaboration .
Tar@@ kov@@ sky would spend two days preparing for Yus@@ ov to film a single long take , and due to the preparation , usually only a single take was needed .
</p>
<p>
in his last film , &quot; The Sac@@ rif@@ ice &quot; , Tar@@ kov@@ sky worked with cinem@@ at@@ ographer S@@ ven Ny@@ k@@ vist , who had worked on many films with director Ing@@ mar Berg@@ man .
Ny@@ k@@ vist complained that Tar@@ kov@@ sky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it .

Arthur Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was a German philosopher .
he is best known for his 18@@ 18 work &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; , wherein he characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of a blind and insatiable metaphysical will .
proceeding from the transcendental idealism of Im@@ manuel Kant , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er developed an athe@@ istic metaphysical and ethical system that has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism , rejecting the contemporaneous post @-@ K@@ anti@@ an philosophies of German idealism .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was among the first thinkers in Western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of Eastern philosophy , having initially arrived at similar conclusions as the result of his own philosophical work .
though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his life , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er has had a pos@@ thum@@ ous impact across various disciplines , including philosophy , literature , and science .
his writing on aesthetics , morality , and psychology influenced thinkers and artists throughout the 19th and 20th centuries .
those who cited his influence include Friedrich Nietzsche , Richard Wagner , Leo Tolstoy , Lud@@ wig W@@ itt@@ gen@@ stein , Er@@ win Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger , Otto R@@ ank , Gust@@ av Mah@@ ler , Joseph Campbell , Albert Einstein , Carl Jung , Thomas Man@@ n , É@@ mile Z@@ ola , George Bernard Shaw , Jorge Luis Bor@@ ges and Samuel Bec@@ kett .
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was born on 22 February 17@@ 88 , in the city of D@@ anz@@ ig on He@@ il@@ ig@@ eg@@ ei@@ st@@ gas@@ se , the son of Johann@@ a Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er and Hein@@ rich Flor@@ is Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , both descendants of wealthy German @-@ Dutch pat@@ ric@@ ian families .
neither of them were very religious , ; each supported the French Revolution , and were re@@ public@@ ans , cosmo@@ polit@@ ans and Angl@@ oph@@ iles .
when D@@ anz@@ ig became part of Pr@@ us@@ sia in 17@@ 93 , Hein@@ rich moved to Hamburg - a free city with a republican constitution , protected by Britain and Holland against Pr@@ ussian aggression - although his firm continued trading in D@@ anz@@ ig where most of their extended families remained .
Adel@@ e , Arthur &apos;s only sibling was born on 12 July 17@@ 97 .
in 17@@ 97 Arthur was sent to Le Hav@@ re to live for two years with the family of his father &apos;s business associate , Gr@@ é@@ go@@ ire de Bl@@ é@@ si@@ ma@@ ire .
he seemed to enjoy his stay there , learned to speak French fluently and started a friendship with Jean Anth@@ ime Gr@@ é@@ go@@ ire de Bl@@ é@@ si@@ ma@@ ire , his peer , which lasted for a large part of their lives .
as early as 17@@ 99 , Arthur started playing the flute .
in 1803 he joined his parents on their long tour of Holland , Britain , France , Switzerland , Austria and Pr@@ us@@ sia ; it was mostly a pleasure tour although Hein@@ rich also visited some of his business associates .
Hein@@ rich gave his son a choice - he could stay at home and start preparations for university education , or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education .
Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious .
he spent twelve weeks of the tour attending a school in Wim@@ bled@@ on where he was very unhappy and appalled by strict but intellectually shallow Anglican religi@@ osity , which he continued to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Angl@@ oph@@ ilia .
he was also under great pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results .
in fact Hein@@ rich Flor@@ is became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health .
in 18@@ 05 , Hein@@ rich Flor@@ is died by drowning in a canal by their home in Hamburg .
although it was possible that his death was accidental , his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to un@@ sociable behavior , anxiety and depression which became especially pronounced in his last months of life .
Arthur showed similar mo@@ od@@ iness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father ; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father &apos;s side of family .
his mother Johann@@ a was generally described as vivac@@ ious and sociable .
despite the hardships , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light .
Hein@@ rich Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among Johann@@ a and the children .
Arthur Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority .
he invested it conserv@@ atively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor .
Arthur endured two long years of drudgery as a merchant in honor of his dead father , and because of his own doubts about being too old to start a life of a scholar .
most of his prior education was practical merchant training and he had some trouble with learning Latin which was a prerequisite for any academic career .
his mother soon moved with his sister Adel@@ e to We@@ im@@ ar - then the centre of German literature - to enjoy social life among celebrated writers and artists .
Arthur lived in Hamburg with his friend Jean Anth@@ ime who was also studying to become a merchant .
after quitting his merchant apprenticeship , with some encouragement from his mother , he dedicated himself to studies at the Go@@ tha gymnasium in Sax@@ e @-@ Go@@ tha @-@ Al@@ ten@@ burg , but he also enjoyed social life among local nobility spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother .
he left Gym@@ n@@ asium after writing a sati@@ rical poem about one of the lecturers .
although Arthur claimed that he left voluntarily , his mother &apos;s letter indicates that he was expelled .
</p>
<p>
he moved to We@@ im@@ ar but didn &apos;t live with his mother who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn &apos;t get along very well .
their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temper@@ a@@ mental differences .
he accused his mother of being financially irresponsible , flir@@ t@@ atious and seeking to remarry , which he considered an insult to his father &apos;s memory .
his mother , while prof@@ essing her love to him , criticized him sharply for being moody , tac@@ tless , and argu@@ mentative - and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people .
Arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls , parties and theater .
by that time Johann@@ a &apos;s famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries , most celebrated of them being Go@@ ethe .
Arthur attended her parties , usually when he knew that Go@@ ethe would be there - though the famous writer and statesman didn &apos;t even seem to notice the young and unknown student .
it is possible that Go@@ ethe kept distance because Johann@@ a warned him about her son &apos;s depressive and comb@@ ative nature , or because Go@@ ethe was then on bad terms with Arthur &apos;s language instructor and roommate , Franz Pas@@ sow .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was also captiv@@ ated by the beautiful Kar@@ oline Jag@@ eman@@ n , mistress of Karl August , Grand Duke of Sax@@ e @-@ We@@ im@@ ar @-@ Eisen@@ ach , and he wrote to her his only known love poem .
despite his later celebration of as@@ ce@@ ticism and negative views of sexuality , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er occasionally had sexual affairs , usually with women of lower social status , such as servants , actresses , and sometimes even paid prostitutes .
in a letter to his friend Anth@@ ime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out @-@ of @-@ wedlock daughters , both of whom died in infancy .
in their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anth@@ ime were somewhat bo@@ ast@@ ful and competitive about their sexual exploits - but Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er seemed aware that women usually didn &apos;t find him very charming or physically attractive , and his desires often remained unfulfilled .
he left We@@ im@@ ar to become a student at the University of Gö@@ t@@ tin@@ gen in 18@@ 09 .
there are no written reasons about why Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er chose that university instead of then more famous University of J@@ ena but Gö@@ t@@ tin@@ gen was known as a more modern , scientifically oriented , with less attention given to theology .
law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s status who also needed career and income ; he choose medicine due to his scientific interests .
among his notable professors were Bern@@ hard Friedrich Thi@@ b@@ aut , Arnold Her@@ mann Lud@@ wig He@@ er@@ en , Johann Friedrich Blu@@ men@@ bach , Friedrich Str@@ ome@@ yer , Hein@@ rich Ad@@ olf Sch@@ ra@@ der , Johann Tob@@ ias May@@ er and Kon@@ rad Johann Martin Lan@@ gen@@ beck .
he studied metaphysics , psychology and logic under Got@@ t@@ lo@@ b Ernst Schul@@ ze , the author of &quot; A@@ ene@@ sid@@ em@@ us &quot; , who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on Plato and Im@@ manuel Kant .
he decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810 @-@ 11 and he left Gö@@ t@@ tin@@ gen which didn &apos;t have a strong philosophy program .
he didn &apos;t regret his medicinal and scientific studies .
he claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher , and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy .
during his days at Gö@@ t@@ tin@@ gen , he spent a lot of time studying , but also continued his flute playing and social life .
his friends included Friedrich Got@@ th@@ il@@ f Os@@ ann , Karl Wit@@ te , Christian Charles Jo@@ sias von Bun@@ sen , and William Back@@ house A@@ stor S@@ r ..
he arrived to the newly founded University of Berlin for the winter semester of 18@@ 11 @-@ 12 .
at the same time his mother just started her literary career ; she published her first book in 1810 , a biography of her friend Karl Lud@@ wig Fer@@ now , which was a critical success .
Arthur attended lectures by the prominent post @-@ K@@ anti@@ an philosopher Johann Got@@ t@@ li@@ eb F@@ ich@@ te but quickly found many points of disagreement with his &quot; Wis@@ sen@@ scha@@ ft@@ sle@@ h@@ re &quot; and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand .
he later mentioned F@@ ich@@ te only in critical , negative terms - seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant &apos;s and considering it useful only because F@@ ich@@ te &apos;s poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of K@@ anti@@ anism .
he also attended the lectures of the famous the@@ ologi@@ an Friedrich Sch@@ le@@ i@@ er@@ mac@@ her whom he also quickly came to dislike .
his notes and comments on Sch@@ le@@ i@@ er@@ mac@@ her &apos;s lectures show that Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards athe@@ ism .
he learned a lot by self @-@ directed reading ; besides Plato , Kant and F@@ ich@@ te he also read the works of Sch@@ elling , F@@ ries , Jac@@ obi , Bacon , Locke , and a lot of current scientific literature .
he attended phil@@ ological courses by August B@@ ö@@ ck@@ h and Friedrich August Wolf and continued his natur@@ alistic interests with courses by Martin Hein@@ rich Kla@@ pro@@ th , Paul Er@@ man , Johann El@@ ert Bo@@ de , Ernst Got@@ t@@ fried Fischer , Johann Hor@@ kel , Friedrich Christian Rosenthal and Hin@@ rich L@@ ich@@ tenstein .

Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er left Berlin in a rush in 18@@ 13 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Pr@@ us@@ sia just joined the war against France .
he returned to We@@ im@@ ar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover , Ge@@ org Friedrich Conrad Lud@@ wig Mü@@ ller von Ger@@ sten@@ ber@@ g@@ k , a civil servant fourteen years younger than her ; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father &apos;s memory .
he settled for a while in Rud@@ ol@@ st@@ ad@@ t hoping that no army would pass through the small town .
he spent his time in solitude , hiking in the mountains and the Thur@@ ing@@ ian forest and writing his dissertation , &quot; On the Four@@ fold Root of the Principle of Su@@ ffici@@ ent Reason &quot; .
he completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the Battle of Lei@@ p@@ zig .
he became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother &apos;s invitation to visit her in We@@ im@@ ar .
she tried to convince him that her relationship with Ger@@ sten@@ ber@@ g@@ k was plat@@ onic and that she had no intentions of re@@ marrying .
but Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Ger@@ sten@@ ber@@ g@@ k because he considered him un@@ talented , pretentious , and nationalistic .
his mother just published her second book , &quot; Rem@@ in@@ isc@@ ences of a Journey in the Years 1803 , 18@@ 04 , and 18@@ 05 &quot; , a description of their family tour of Europe , which quickly became a hit .
she found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy .
in a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the &quot; rubbish &quot; she wrote was totally forgotten .
in fact , although they considered her novels of dubious quality , the Brock@@ haus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well .
Hans Brock@@ haus later claimed that his predecessors ... &quot; saw nothing in this manuscript , but wanted to please one of our best @-@ selling authors by publishing her son &apos;s work . we published more and more of her son Arthur &apos;s work and today nobody remembers Johann@@ a , but her son &apos;s works are in steady demand and contribute to Brock@@ haus &apos; &#91; s &#93; reputation . &quot; he kept large portraits of the pair in his office in Lei@@ p@@ zig for the edi@@ fication of his new editors .
also contrary to his mother &apos;s prediction , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s dissertation made an impression on Go@@ ethe to whom he sent it as a gift .
although it is doubtful that Go@@ ethe agreed with Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s philosophical positions he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education .
their subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero .
they mostly discussed Go@@ ethe &apos;s newly published work on color theory .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er soon started writing his own treatise on the subject , &quot; On Vision and Col@@ ors &quot; , which in many points differed from his teacher &apos;s .
although they remained polite towards each other , their growing theoretical disagreements - and especially Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s tac@@ tless criticisms and extreme self @-@ confidence - soon made Go@@ ethe become distant again and after 18@@ 16 their correspondence became less frequent .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection , but he continued to praise Go@@ ethe , and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own .
another important experience during his stay in We@@ im@@ ar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Maj@@ er - a historian of religion , orient@@ alist and disciple of Her@@ der - who introduced him to the Eastern philosophy .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was immediately impressed by the &quot; U@@ pan@@ ish@@ ads &quot; and the Buddha and put them at par with Plato and Kant .
he continued his studies by reading the &quot; Bhag@@ av@@ ad G@@ ita &quot; , an am@@ ate@@ ur@@ ish German journal &quot; Asi@@ ati@@ sch@@ es Mag@@ azin &quot; and &quot; Asi@@ atic@@ k Resear@@ ches &quot; by The Asi@@ atic Society .
although he loved Hindu texts he was more interested in Buddhism , which he came to regard as the best religion .
however , his early studies were constrained by the lack of adequate literature , and were mostly restricted to Early Buddhism .
he also claimed that he formulated most of his ideas independently , and only later realized the similarities with Buddhism .
as the relationship with his mother fell to a new low he left We@@ im@@ ar and moved to Dres@@ den in May 1814 .
he continued his philosophical studies , enjoyed the cultural life , socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs .
his friends in Dres@@ den were Johann Got@@ t@@ lo@@ b von Qu@@ and@@ t , Friedrich Lau@@ n , Karl Christian Friedrich Kra@@ use and Lud@@ wig Sig@@ is@@ mund Ru@@ hl , a young painter who made a rom@@ anti@@ ci@@ zed portrait of him in which he improved some of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s unattractive physical features .
his criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public .
however , his main occupation during his stay in Dres@@ den was his seminal philosophical work , &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; , which he started writing in 1814 and finished in 18@@ 18 .
he was recommended to Friedrich Arnold Brock@@ haus by Baron Ferdinand von Bi@@ ed@@ en@@ feld , an acquaintance of his mother .
although the publisher accepted his manuscript , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er made a poor impression because of his quarrel@@ some and fussy attitude and very poor sales of the book after it was published in December 18@@ 18 .
in September 18@@ 18 , while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er left Dres@@ den for a year@@ long vacation in Italy .
he visited Venice , Bologna , Florence , Naples and Milan , travelling alone or accompanied by mostly English tourists he met .
he spent winter months in Rome where he accidentally met his acquaintance Karl Wit@@ te and engaged in numerous quarrels with German tourists in C@@ aff@@ e G@@ rec@@ o , among them Johann Friedrich B@@ ö@@ h@@ mer who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character .
he enjoyed art , architecture , ancient ruins , attended plays and operas , continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs .
one of his affairs supposedly became serious , and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich Italian nobl@@ ew@@ oman - but despite his mentioning this several times , no details are known and it may have been Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er exagg@@ erating .
he corresponded regularly with his sister Adel@@ e and became close to her as her relationship with Johann@@ a and Ger@@ sten@@ ber@@ g@@ k also deteriorated .
she informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of A. L. Mu@@ hl in D@@ anz@@ ig - in which her mother invested their whole savings and Arthur a third of his - was near bankruptcy .
Arthur offered to share his assets but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments .
the women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while Arthur , using his business knowledge , took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full .
the affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er family .
he shortened his stay in Italy because of the trouble with Mu@@ hl and returned to Dres@@ den .
disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him both with income and the opportunity to promote his views .
he contacted his friends at universities in Heid@@ elberg , Gö@@ t@@ tin@@ gen and Berlin and found Berlin most attractive .
he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher G. W. F. Heg@@ el , whom Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er described as a &quot; clumsy char@@ lat@@ an . &quot; he was especially appalled by Heg@@ el &apos;s supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in March 1820 .
Heg@@ el was also facing political suspicions at the time when many progressive professors were fired , while Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics .
despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own , Heg@@ el still voted to accept Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er to the university .
however , only five students turned up to Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s lectures , and he dropped out of academia .
a late essay , &quot; On University Philosophy &quot; , expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies .
</p>
<p>
after his academic failure he continued to travel extensively , visiting Lei@@ p@@ zig , Nuremberg , St@@ utt@@ g@@ art , Scha@@ ff@@ ha@@ us@@ en , V@@ ev@@ ey , Milan and spending eight months in Florence .
however , before he left for his three @-@ year travel , he had an incident with his Berlin neighbor , forty @-@ seven @-@ year @-@ old seam@@ stress Caroline Louise Mar@@ quet .
the details of the August 18@@ 21 incident are unknown .
he claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave , and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him .
she claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work .
she immediately sued him , and the process lasted until May 18@@ 27 , when a court found Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 18@@ 42 .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er enjoyed Italy , where he studied art and socialized with Italian and English nobles .
it was his last visit to the country .
he left for Munich and stayed there for a year , mostly recuper@@ ating from various health issues , some of them possibly caused by ven@@ ereal diseases .
he contacted publishers offering to translate Hum@@ e into German and Kant into English but his proposals were declined .
returning to Berlin he began to study Spanish so he could read some of his favorite authors in their original language .
he liked Pedro Calderón de la Bar@@ ca , L@@ ope de Vega , Miguel de Cer@@ v@@ antes , and especially Bal@@ tas@@ ar Grac@@ i@@ án .
he also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works .
few attempts to revive his lectures - again scheduled at the same time as Heg@@ el &apos;s - also failed , as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities .
during his Berlin years Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family .
for a while he was unsuccessfully cour@@ ting 17 @-@ year @-@ old Flora We@@ iss , who was 22 years younger than him .
his unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of monog@@ amy but still not advocating poly@@ gy@@ ny - instead m@@ using about a poly@@ amorous relationship he called &quot; tetra@@ gam@@ y &quot; .
he had an on and off relationship with a young dancer Caroline Richter .
they met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the Berlin Opera .
she already had numerous lovers and an out @-@ of @-@ wedlock son , and later gave birth to another son , this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat . .
as Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was preparing to escape Berlin in 18@@ 31 , due to cholera epidemic , he offered to take her with him on the condition that she leaves her young son .
she refused and he went alone ; in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er claimed that in his last year in Berlin , he had a prophe@@ tic dream that urged him to escape the city .
as he arrived in his new home in Frankfurt he supposedly had another supernatural experience , an appar@@ ition of his dead father and his mother who was still alive .
this experience led him to spend some time investigating par@@ an@@ orm@@ al phenomena and magic .
he was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent , but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will .
upon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health .
he renewed his correspondence with his mother , and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father .
by now Johann@@ a and Adel@@ e were living very modestly .
Johann@@ a &apos;s writing didn &apos;t bring her much income , and her popularity was waning .
their correspondence remained reserved , and Arthur Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er seemed undisturbed by her death in 18@@ 38 .
his relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 18@@ 49 .
in July 18@@ 32 Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er left Frankfurt for Mann@@ heim but returned in July 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life , except for a few short journeys .
he lived alone except for a succession of pet po@@ od@@ les named At@@ man and But@@ z .
in 18@@ 36 , he published &quot; On the Will in Nature &quot; .
in 18@@ 36 he sent his essay &quot; On the Freedom of the Will &quot; to the contest of the &quot; Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences &quot; and won the prize next year .
he sent another essay , &quot; On the Basis of Mor@@ ality &quot; , to the &quot; Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies &quot; but didn &apos;t win the prize despite being the only contestant .
the Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner , claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , who was very self @-@ confident that he will win , was enraged by this rejection .
he published both essays as &quot; The Two Basic Problems of Ethics &quot; and in the preface to the second edition of this book , in 1860 , he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society .
first edition , published in 18@@ 41 , again failed to draw attention to his philosophy .
two years later , after some negotiations , he managed to convince his publisher , Brock@@ haus , to print the second , updated edition of &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; .
the book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative .
however , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er did start to attract some followers , mostly outside academia , among practical professionals who pursued private philosophical studies .
he jo@@ kingly referred to them as &quot; evangel@@ ists &quot; and &quot; apostles &quot; .
one of the most active early followers was Julius Fra@@ u@@ en@@ st@@ ä@@ dt who wrote numerous articles promoting Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s philosophy .
he was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brock@@ haus refused to publish &quot; Par@@ erga and Par@@ al@@ ip@@ omen@@ a &quot; believing that it would be another failure .
though Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er later stopped corresponding with him , claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas , Fra@@ u@@ en@@ st@@ ä@@ dt continued to promote Sch@@ op@@ e@@ hn@@ auer &apos;s work .
they renewed their communication in 1859 and Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er named him heir for his literary estate .
he also became the editor of the first collected works of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er .
in 1848 Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er witnessed violent upheaval in Frankfurt after General Hans Ad@@ olf Er@@ d@@ mann von Au@@ ers@@ wald and Prince Felix L@@ ich@@ now@@ sky were murdered .
he became worried for his own safety and property .
even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves .
he gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels .
the rebellion passed without any loss to Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er and he later praised Alfred I , Prince of Win@@ dis@@ ch @-@ Gr@@ ä@@ tz for restoring order .
he even modified his will , leaving a large part of his property to a Pr@@ ussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle .
as Young Heg@@ el@@ ians were advocating change and progress Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er claimed that misery is natural for humans - and that even if some utopian society were established , people would still fight each other out of boredom , or would starve due to overpopulation .
in 18@@ 51 Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er published &quot; Par@@ erga and Par@@ al@@ ip@@ omen@@ a &quot; , which , as the title says , contains essays that are supplementary to his main work , and are mostly comprehensible to readers unfamiliar with his earlier philosophy .
it was his first successful , widely read book , partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews .
the essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn &apos;t contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system .
many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn &apos;t take his philosophy seriously .
his early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those F@@ ich@@ te and Sch@@ elling , or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy .
both criticisms enraged Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er .
however , he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights , but encouraged his disciples to do so .
his private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions , inconsistencies , and vagueness in his philosophy , but claimed that he wasn &apos;t concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions and that some of his ideas shouldn &apos;t be taken literally but instead as metaphors .
academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work .
in 18@@ 56 University of Lei@@ p@@ zig sponsored an essay contest about Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s philosophy , which was won by Rud@@ olf Sey@@ del &apos;s very critical essay .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s friend Jules Lun@@ tes@@ ch@@ ü@@ tz made a first of his four portraits of him - which Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er didn &apos;t particularly like - that was soon sold to a wealthy land@@ owner Carl Ferdinand Wi@@ e@@ si@@ ke who built a house to display it .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er seemed flattered and amused by this , and would claim that it was his first chapel .
as his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works .
people visited Frankfurt &apos;s &quot; Engl@@ is@@ cher H@@ of &quot; to observe him dining .
admirers gave him gifts and asked for auto@@ graphs .
he complained , however , that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age .
he remained healthy in his old age , which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather , and always getting enough sleep .
he had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his hearing was declining since his youth and he developed problems with rheumatism .
he remained active and lucid , continued his reading , writing and correspond@@ ences until his death .
the numerous notes that he made during these years , amongst others on aging , were published pos@@ thum@@ ously under the title &quot; Sen@@ ilia &quot; .
in the spring of 1860 his health started to decline , he experienced shortness of breath and heart pal@@ p@@ itations ; in September he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak .
his last friend to visit him was Wilhelm G@@ winner and according to him Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was concerned that he won &apos;t be able to finish his planned additions to &quot; Par@@ erga and Par@@ al@@ ip@@ omen@@ a &quot; but was at peace with dying .
he died of pulmonary @-@ respiratory failure , on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch .
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er saw his philosophy as a continuation of that of Kant , and used the results of his epistem@@ ological investigations , that is , transcendental idealism , as starting point for his own :
my philosophy is founded on that of Kant , and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it .
Kant &apos;s teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehen@@ ded it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new @-@ birth .
it alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect , which neither Berkeley nor Mal@@ e@@ bran@@ che succeed in doing , for they remain too much in the universal , while Kant goes into the particular , and indeed in a way that is quite un@@ exam@@ pled both before and after him , and which has quite a peculiar , and , we might say , immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete un@@ deception , and forthwith looks at all things in another light .
only in this way can anyone become susceptible to the more positive ex@@ positions which I have to give .
Kant had argued the empirical world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work :
&quot; the world is my representation . &quot; we do not draw empirical laws from nature , but prescribe them to it .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er praises Kant for his distinction between appearance and the things @-@ in @-@ themselves that appear , whereas the general consensus in German I@@ deal@@ ism was that this was the weakest spot of Kant &apos;s theory , since according to Kant causality can find application on objects of experience only , and consequently , things @-@ in @-@ themselves cannot be the cause of appearances , as Kant argued .
the inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er .
he insisted that this distinction was a true conclusion , drawn from false premises .
</p>
<p>
in November 18@@ 13 Go@@ ethe invited Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er for research on his Theory of Col@@ ours .
although Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er considered colour theory a minor matter , he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Go@@ ethe .
nevertheless , these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistem@@ ology : finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality .
Kant openly admitted that it was Hum@@ e &apos;s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations of &quot; Cri@@ tique of Pure Reason &quot; .
in it , he gives an elaborate proof to show that causality is given a priori .
after G.@@ E. Schul@@ ze had made it plausible that Kant had not dis@@ proven Hum@@ e &apos;s skepticism , it was up to those loyal to the project of Kant to prove this important matter .
the difference between the approach of Kant and Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was this :
Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is &quot; given &quot; to us from outside , an expression with which Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er often expressed his dissatisfaction .
he , on the other hand , was occupied with : how do we get this empirical content of perception ; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations &quot; limited to my skin &quot; as the objective perception of things that lie &quot; outside &quot; of me ?
the sensations in the hand of a man born blind , on feeling an object of cubic shape , are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction : the edges , it is true , press upon a smaller portion of his hand , still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations .
his Understanding , however , draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt , that this resistance must have a cause , which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body ; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object , while the hand &apos;s sensation remains un@@ altered , he constructs the cubic shape in Space .
if the representation of a cause and of Space , together with their laws , had not already existed within him , the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand .
causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions , but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality .
hereby Hum@@ e &apos;s skepticism is dis@@ proven .
by this intellectual operation , comprehen@@ ding every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause , the external world arises .
with vision , finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines .
we are seldom conscious of the process , that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object ; that turns the upside down impression ; and that adds depth to make from the plan@@ im@@ etr@@ ical data stere@@ ome@@ trical perception with distance between objects .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception , the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation .
he set out his theory of perception for the first time in &quot; On Vision and Col@@ ors &quot; , and in the subsequent editions of Four@@ fold Root an extensive exposition is given in § 21 .
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er developed a system called metaphysical voluntar@@ ism .
... is absolutely identical with the will we find within us and know as intimately as we can know any thing ; that , on the other hand , knowledge with its substr@@ atum , the intellect , is a merely secondary phenomenon , differing completely from the will , only accompanying its higher degrees of objec@@ tification and not essential to it ;
... that we are never able therefore to infer absence of will from absence of knowledge .
for Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , human desire was futile , illogical , direc@@ tionless , and , by extension , so was all human action in the world .
Einstein paraphra@@ sed his views as follows : &quot; man can indeed do what he wants , but he cannot will what he wants . &quot; in this sense , he adhered to the F@@ ich@@ te@@ an principle of idealism :
&quot; the world is &quot; for &quot; a subject . &quot; this idealism so presented , immediately commits it to an ethical attitude , unlike the purely epistem@@ ological concerns of Des@@ car@@ tes and Berkeley .
to Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual , intelligent agents , but ultimately all observable phenomena - an evil to be terminated via mankind &apos;s duties : as@@ ce@@ ticism and chastity .
he is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy :
&quot; the world is my representation . &quot; Friedrich Nietzsche was greatly influenced by this idea of Will , although he eventually rejected it .
</p>
<p>
for Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , human desiring , &quot; willing , &quot; and craving cause suffering or pain .
a temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation .
aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain - albeit temporarily - because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation .
instead , one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception from which one is separated ; rather one becomes one with that perception :
&quot; &quot; one can thus no longer separate the percei@@ ver from the perception &quot; &quot; .
from this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one &apos;s individual will but , rather , becomes a &quot; &quot; subject of cognition &quot; &quot; to a perception that is &quot; &quot; Pure , will @-@ less , timeless &quot; &quot; where the essence , &quot; ideas , &quot; of the world are shown .
art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one &apos;s immersion with the world , thus tries to depict the essence / pure ideas of the world .
music , for Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , was the pu@@ rest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Su@@ ffici@@ ent Gr@@ ounds , therefore as an individual object .
according to Daniel Albright , &quot; Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas , but actually embodied the will itself . &quot; he deemed music a timeless , universal language comprehen@@ ded everywhere , that can imbu@@ e global enthusiasm , if in possession of a significant melody .
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s realist views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporaneous attempts to prove the parallel postulate in Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an geometry .
writing shortly before the discovery of hyper@@ bolic geometry demonstrated the logical independence of the axi@@ om - and long before the general theory of relativity revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space - Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect concepts to prove what he held was directly evident from intuitive percep@@ tion@@ . text = The Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking par@@ ody and car@@ icature in the famous controversy over the theory of &quot; parallels &quot; , and in the attempts , repeated every year , to prove the eleventh axi@@ om .
the axi@@ om asserts , and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line , that two lines inclined to each other , if produced far enough , must meet .
now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self @-@ evident , and therefore needs a proof ; but no such proof can be produced , just because there is nothing more immediate .
throughout his writings , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts , instead of from intuitive percep@@ tion@@ s. text = In fact , it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity .
but it is precisely through the controversies over this , together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the &quot; directly &quot; certain as merely &quot; indirectly &quot; certain , that the independence and clear@@ ness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the us@@ elessness and difficulty of logical proof , a contrast as instructive as it is amusing .
the direct certainty will not be admitted here , just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept , and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject , according to the principle of contradiction .
but that eleventh axi@@ om regarding parallel lines is a synthetic proposition &quot; a priori &quot; , and as such has the guarantee of pure , not empirical , perception ; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the principle of contradiction itself , from which all proofs originally derive their certainty .
at bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem ...
although Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er could see no justification for trying to prove Eu@@ cl@@ id &apos;s parallel postulate , he did see a reason for examining another of Eu@@ cl@@ id &apos;s axi@@ om@@ s. text = It surprises me that the eighth axi@@ om , &quot; Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another , &quot; is not rather attacked .
thus it presupposes mobility of the figures , but matter alone is movable in space .
consequently , this reference to coincidence with one another fors@@ akes pure space , the sole element of geometry , in order to pass over to the material and empirical .
this follows Kant &apos;s reasoning .
</p>
<p>
the task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done , but to investigate moral actions .
philosophy is always theoretical : its task to explain what is given .
according to Kant &apos;s teaching of transcendental idealism , space and time are forms of our sensibility due to which phenomena appear in multiplicity .
reality in itself is free from all multiplicity , not in the sense that an object is one , but that it is outside the &quot; possibility &quot; of multiplicity .
from this follows that two individuals , though they appear as distinct , are in @-@ themselves not distinct .
the appearances are entirely subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason .
the ego@@ istic individual who focuses his aims completely on his own interests has therefore to deal with empirical laws as well as he can .
what is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self @-@ interest .
if we take for example a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty , and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support &quot; their &quot; needs instead his &quot; own &quot; pleasures , then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes &quot; less distinction between himself &quot; and others than is usually made .
regarding how the things &quot; appear &quot; to us , the ego@@ ist is right to assert the gap between two individuals , but the altru@@ ist experiences the sufferings of others as his own .
in the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals , though they appear as distinct from himself .
what motivates the altru@@ ist is compassion .
the suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent , but he feels connected to all beings .
compassion is thus the basis of morality .
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the &quot; princip@@ ium individu@@ ation@@ is &quot; .
when we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence .
individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others - the will , as the only thing that exists , has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure .
this is a fundamental characteristic of the will , and cannot be circum@@ vented .
unlike temporal , or human justice , which requires time to repay an evil deed and , &quot; has its seat in the state , as requi@@ ting and punishing . &quot; eternal justice , &quot; rules not the state but the world , is not dependent upon human institutions , is not subject to chance and deception , is not uncertain , wavering , and err@@ ing , but infallible , fixed , and sure . &quot; eternal justice is not retribu@@ tive because retribution requires time .
there are no delays or repri@@ eves .
instead , punishment is tied the offence , &quot; to the point where the two become one .... &quot; &quot; Tor@@ men@@ ter and tormented are one . the &#91; Tor@@ men@@ ter &#93; err@@ s in that he believes he is not a par@@ taker in the suffering ; the &#91; tormented &#93; , in that he believes he is not a par@@ taker in the guilt . &quot; suffering is the moral retribution of our attachment to pleasure .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of original sin and in Eastern religions with the dogma of rebirth .
</p>
<p>
he who sees through the &quot; princip@@ ium individu@@ ation@@ is &quot; and comprehen@@ ds suffering &quot; in general &quot; as his own , will see suffering everywhere , and instead of using all his force to fight for the happiness of his individual manifestation , he will ab@@ hor life itself , of which he knows how in@@ separ@@ ably it is connected with suffering .
a happy individual life midst a world of suffering is for him like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king .
those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge can no longer affirm life , but will exhibit as@@ ce@@ ticism and qui@@ e@@ tism , meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives , are not concerned about their individual welfare , and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting .
they welcome poverty , do not seek nor flee death .
human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction , and instead of renewing this contract , the as@@ ce@@ tic breaks it .
it matters little whether these as@@ ce@@ tics adhered to the dog@@ mata of Christianity or D@@ harm@@ ic religions , since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge .
the Christian mystic and the teacher of the V@@ ed@@ anta philosophy agree in this respect also , they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection .
so much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not , as optimistic dul@@ l@@ ness likes to assert , an eccentricity and per@@ versity of the mind , but an essential side of human nature , which only appears so rarely because of its excellence .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er referred to as@@ ce@@ ticism as the denial of the will to live .

philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the trib@@ ulations of sex , but Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er addressed it and related concepts forth@@ rightly :
... one ought rather to be surprised that a thing &#91; sex &#93; which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether , and lies before us as raw and untreated material .
he named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason : the Will to Live or Will to Life , defined as an inherent drive within human beings , and indeed all creatures , to stay alive ; a force that inv@@ eig@@ les us into reproducing .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental , but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within man &apos;s psyche , guaranteeing the quality of the human race :
the ultimate aim of all love affairs ... is more important than all other aims in man &apos;s life ; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it .
what is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...
it has often been argued that Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s thoughts on sexuality foreshad@@ owed the theory of evolution , a claim that seems to have been met with satisfaction by Darwin as he included a quote of the German philosopher in his Descent of Man after having read such a claim .
this has also been noted about Freud &apos;s concepts of the li@@ bid@@ o and the unconscious mind , and evolutionary psychology in general .
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s politics were , for the most part , an echo of his system of ethics .
ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work , &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; .
in occasional political comments in his &quot; Par@@ erga and Par@@ al@@ ip@@ omen@@ a &quot; and &quot; Man@@ us@@ cript Rem@@ ains &quot; , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er described himself as a proponent of limited government .
what was essential , he thought , was that the state should &quot; leave each man free to work out his own salvation , &quot; and so long as government was thus limited , he would &quot; prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of &#91; his &#93; fellow rats &quot; - i.e. , by a monarch , rather than a dem@@ ocrat .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er shared the view of Thomas Hob@@ bes on the necessity of the state , and of state action , to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species .
he also defended the independence of the legislative , judicial and executive branches of power , and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice .
a typical example is , &quot; For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth , for he thinks slowly , and they give him time to reflect . &quot; Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er attributed civilizational primacy to the northern &quot; white races &quot; due to their sensitivity and creativity :
the highest civilization and culture , apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians , are found exclusively among the white races ; and even with many dark peoples , the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has , therefore , evidently im@@ migrated , for example , the Brah@@ mans , the In@@ cas , and the rulers of the South Sea Islands .
all this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north , and there gradually became white , had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need , want and misery , which in their many forms were brought about by the climate .
this they had to do in order to make up for the par@@ si@@ mony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization .
despite this , he was adam@@ antly against differing treatment of races , was fervently anti @-@ slavery , and supported the abolitionist movement in the United States .
he describes the treatment of &quot; &#91; our &#93; innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into &#91; the slave @-@ master &apos;s &#93; dev@@ il@@ ish clut@@ ches &quot; as &quot; belonging to the black@@ est pages of mankind &apos;s criminal record . &quot; Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political anti @-@ Judaism .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materi@@ alistic basis of Judaism , exhibiting an Indian @-@ influenced ethics reflecting the Ar@@ yan @-@ V@@ edic theme of spiritual self @-@ conquest .
he saw this as opposed to what he held was the ignorant drive toward earthly ut@@ opi@@ anism and super@@ fici@@ ality of a worldly &quot; Jewish &quot; spirit :
while all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life , the religion of the Jews is entirely im@@ manent and furn@@ ishes nothing but a mere war @-@ cry in the struggle with other nations .
</p>
<p>
the State , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er claimed , punishes criminals to prevent future crimes .
it does so by placing &quot; beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone , in the inescapable punishment . accordingly , the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter @-@ motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined ... &quot; He claimed this doctrine was not original to him .
previously , it appeared in the writings of Plato , Sen@@ eca , Hob@@ bes , Pu@@ f@@ endor@@ f , and An@@ sel@@ m Fe@@ u@@ erb@@ ach .
</p>
<p>
in Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s 18@@ 51 essay &quot; On Women &quot; , he expressed his opposition to what he called &quot; Te@@ uton@@ ico @-@ Christian stupidity &quot; of reflexi@@ ve un@@ examined reverence for the female .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er wrote that &quot; Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish , frivolous and short @-@ sighted . &quot; he opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice , and expressed opposition to monog@@ amy .
indeed , Rod@@ gers and Thompson in &quot; Philosoph@@ ers Be@@ having Bad@@ ly &quot; call Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &quot; a mis@@ og@@ yn@@ ist without rival in ... Western philosophy . &quot; he claimed that &quot; woman is by nature meant to obey . &quot; the essay does give some compliments , however : that &quot; women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than &#91; men &#93; are , &quot; and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s writings have influenced many , from Friedrich Nietzsche to nineteenth @-@ century fem@@ inists . &quot;
feminism and the Limits of Equality &quot; PA Cain - G@@ a .
L. Rev. , 1989 Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s biological analysis of the difference between the sexes , and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction , anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by soci@@ obi@@ ologists and evolutionary psychologists .
when the elderly Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er sat for a sculpture portrait by the Pr@@ ussian sculptor Elis@@ abet N@@ ey in 1859 , he was much impressed by the young woman &apos;s wit and independence , as well as by her skill as a visual artist .
after his time with N@@ ey , he told Richard Wagner &apos;s friend Mal@@ wi@@ da von Me@@ y@@ sen@@ bug , &quot; I have not yet spoken my last word about women . I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass , or rather raising herself above the mass , she grows ceaselessly and more than a man . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er viewed personality and intellect as being inherited .
he quotes Hor@@ ace &apos;s saying , &quot; From the brave and good are the brave descended &quot; and Shakespeare &apos;s line from &quot; Cy@@ m@@ bel@@ ine &quot; , &quot; Cow@@ ards father co@@ wards , and base things sire base &quot; to reinforce his hered@@ itarian argument .
mechan@@ istically , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother , and personal character through one &apos;s father .
this belief in her@@ itability of traits informed Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s view of love - placing it at the highest level of importance .
for Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er the &quot; final aim of all love intri@@ gues , be they comic or tragic , is really of more importance than all other ends in human life . what it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation . ... It is not the we@@ al or woe of any one individual , but that of the human race to come , which is here at stake . &quot; this view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eu@@ gen@@ ics or good breeding .
here Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er wrote : with our knowledge of the complete un@@ alter@@ ability both of character and of mental faculties , we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within , not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation .
Plato had something of the kind in mind when , in the fifth book of his &quot; Republic &quot; , he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste .
if we could ca@@ strate all scoun@@ d@@ rels and stick all stupid geese in a convent , and give men of noble character a whole ha@@ rem , and procure men , and indeed thorough men , for all girls of intellect and understanding , then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Per@@ icles .
in another context , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er reiterated his eu@@ genic thesis : &quot; if you want Utop@@ ian plans , I would say : the only solution to the problem is the despo@@ tism of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy , a genuine nobility , achieved by mating the most magnanim@@ ous men with the clever@@ est and most gifted women . this proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Plat@@ onic Republic . &quot; analysts have suggested that Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s anti @-@ eg@@ al@@ it@@ ari@@ anist sentiment and his support for eu@@ gen@@ ics influenced the neo @-@ aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche , who initially considered Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er his mentor .
</p>
<p>
as a consequence of his mon@@ istic philosophy , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was very concerned about the welfare of animals .
for him , all individual animals , including humans , are essentially the same , being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will .
the word &quot; will &quot; designated , for him , force , power , impulse , energy , and desire ; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct , inner experience .
since every living thing possesses will , then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other .
for this reason , he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals , who are our fellow sufferers .
compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character , and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man .
nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy .
the assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western cr@@ ud@@ ity and barb@@ arity .
universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality .
in 18@@ 41 , he praised the establishment , in London , of the Society for the Prevention of Cru@@ el@@ ty to Animals , and also the Animals &apos; Friends Society in Philadelphia .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun &quot; it &quot; in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things .
to reinforce his points , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter .
he was very attached to his succession of pet po@@ od@@ les .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er criticized Spin@@ oza &apos;s belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans .
</p>
<p>
in the third , expanded edition of &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er added an appendix to his chapter on the &quot; Met@@ aph@@ ysics of Sexual Love &quot; .
he wrote that pe@@ der@@ asty did have the benefit of preventing ill @-@ beg@@ ot@@ ten children .
concerning this , he stated that &quot; the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature , and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims , although only indirectly , as a means for preventing greater evils . &quot; Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er ends the appendix with the statement that &quot; by exp@@ ounding these paradoxical ideas , I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour . I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slan@@ dering me by saying that I defend and commend pe@@ der@@ asty . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er read the Latin translation of the ancient Hindu texts , the U@@ pan@@ ish@@ ads , which French writer An@@ que@@ til du Per@@ ron had translated from the Persian translation of Prince Dar@@ a Shu@@ koh entitled &quot; Sir@@ re @-@ Ak@@ bar &quot; .
he was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them &quot; the production of the highest human wisdom , &quot; and believed they contained super@@ human concepts .
the U@@ pan@@ ish@@ ads was a great source of inspiration to Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er .
writing about them , he said : it is the most satisfying and elevating reading which is possible in the world ; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death .
the book &quot; O@@ up@@ ne@@ k@@ hat &quot; always lay open on his table , and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night .
he called the opening up of S@@ ans@@ k@@ rit literature &quot; the greatest gift of our century &quot; and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the U@@ pan@@ ish@@ ads would become the cherished faith of the West .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was first introduced to the 18@@ 02 Latin U@@ pan@@ is@@ had translation through Friedrich Maj@@ er .
they met during the winter of 18@@ 13 @-@ 1814 in We@@ im@@ ar at the home of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s mother according to the bi@@ ographer Saf@@ rans@@ ki .
Maj@@ er was a follower of Her@@ der , and an early Ind@@ ologist .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er did not begin a serious study of the In@@ dic texts , however , until the summer of 1814 .
Saf@@ rans@@ ki maintains that between 1815 and 1817 , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er had another important cross @-@ pollination with Indian thought in Dres@@ den .
this was through his neighbor of two years , Karl Christian Friedrich Kra@@ use .
Kra@@ use was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom .
Kra@@ use had also mastered S@@ ans@@ k@@ rit , unlike Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , and the two developed a professional relationship .
it was from Kra@@ use that Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er learned meditation and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought .
most noticeable , in the case of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s work , was the significance of the Chand@@ og@@ ya U@@ pan@@ is@@ had , whose Mah@@ ā@@ v@@ ā@@ k@@ ya , T@@ at T@@ v@@ am A@@ si , is mentioned throughout &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; .

Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the Four Noble Tru@@ ths of Buddh@@ is@@ m.@@ Abel@@ son , Peter .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er and Buddhism &#93; . &quot;
philosophy East and West Volume 43 , Number 2 &quot; , pp. 255 @-@ 278 .
University of Hawaii Press .
retrieved on : 12 April 2008 .
similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering , that suffering is caused by desire , and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation .
thus three of the four &quot; truths of the Buddha &quot; correspond to Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s doctrine of the will .
in Buddhism , however , while greed and lust are always un@@ skillful , desire is ethically variable - it can be skillful , un@@ skillful , or neutral .
for Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , will had ont@@ ological primacy over the intellect .
in other words , desire is prior to thought .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er felt this was similar to notions of pur@@ u@@ ṣ@@ ā@@ r@@ tha or goals of life in V@@ ed@@ ā@@ n@@ ta Hinduism .
in Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s philosophy , denial of the will is attained by either :
however , Buddhist n@@ ir@@ v@@ ā@@ ṇ@@ a is not equivalent to the condition that Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er described as denial of the will .
n@@ ir@@ v@@ ā@@ ṇ@@ a is not the extinguishing of the &quot; person &quot; as some Western scholars have thought , but only the &quot; extinguishing &quot; of the flames of greed , hatred , and delusion that ass@@ ail a person &apos;s character .
occult historian Jo@@ sc@@ el@@ yn God@@ win stated , &quot; It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , and , through him , attracted Richard Wagner . &quot; this Orient@@ alism reflected the struggle of the German Rom@@ antics , in the words of Leon Poli@@ akov , to &quot; free themselves from Ju@@ deo @-@ Christian fetters . &quot; in contra@@ distinction to God@@ win &apos;s claim that Buddhism inspired Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , the philosopher himself made the following statement in his discussion of religions :
Jan@@ away , Christopher , &quot; Self and World in Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s Philosophy &quot; , p .
if I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth , I should have to concede to Buddhism pre @-@ eminence over the others .
in any case , it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own , for this numbers far more followers than any other .
and this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me , inasmuch as &quot; in my philosoph@@ izing I have certainly not been under its influence &quot; &#91; emphasis added .
for up till 18@@ 18 , when my work appeared , there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism .
Buddhist philosopher Nish@@ it@@ ani Kei@@ ji , however , sought to distance Buddhism from Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er .
while Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary , his methodology was resolutely empirical , rather than speculative or transcendental :
philosophy ... is a science , and as such has no articles of faith ; accordingly , in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically , or demonstrated through indu@@ bit@@ able conclusions .
also note : this actual world of what is know@@ able , in which we are and which is in us , remains both the material and the limit of our consideration .
the argument that Buddhism affected Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s philosophy more than any other D@@ harm@@ ic faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; in 18@@ 18 .
scholars have started to revise earlier views about Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s discovery of Buddhism .
proof of early interest and influence , however , appears in Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s 1815 / 16 notes about Buddhism .
they are included in a recent case study that traces Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s interest in Buddhism and documents its influence .

some traditions in Western eso@@ ter@@ icism and parap@@ sy@@ ch@@ ology interested Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er and influenced his philosophical theories .
he praised animal magnetism as evidence for the reality of magic in his &quot; On the Will in Nature &quot; , and went so far as to accept the division of magic into left @-@ hand and right @-@ hand magic , although he doubted the existence of demons .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will , not on ritual .
this theory notably parallels Ale@@ ister Crow@@ ley &apos;s system of mag@@ ick and its emphasis on human will .
given the importance of the Will to Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s overarching system , this amounts to &quot; suggesting his whole philosophical system had magical powers . &quot; Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er rejected the theory of dis@@ enchantment and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic , which he believed amount to &quot; practical metaphysics . &quot; Ne@@ o@@ plat@@ onism , including the traditions of P@@ lo@@ tin@@ us and to a lesser extent Mar@@ si@@ lio Fic@@ ino , has also been cited as an influence on Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er .
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er had a wide range of interests , from science and opera to oc@@ cul@@ tism and literature .
in his student years Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy .
he kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death , and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library .
many evenings were spent in the theatre , opera and ballet ; the operas of Mozart , Ross@@ ini and Bell@@ ini were especially esteemed .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er considered music the highest art , and played the flute during his whole life .
as a poly@@ g@@ lot , the philosopher knew German , Italian , Spanish , French , English , Latin and ancient Greek , and he was an avid reader of poetry and literature .
he particularly revered Go@@ ethe , Petr@@ arch , Calderón and Shakespeare .
if Go@@ ethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him , so to speak , in the spirit of the age , the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction .
but now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity .
in philosophy , his most important influences were , according to himself , Kant , Plato and the U@@ pan@@ ish@@ ads .
concerning the U@@ pan@@ ish@@ ads and V@@ ed@@ as , he writes in &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; :
if the reader has also received the benefit of the V@@ ed@@ as , the access to which by means of the U@@ pan@@ ish@@ ads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century may claim before all previous centuries , if then the reader , I say , has received his initiation in prim@@ eval Indian wisdom , and received it with an open heart , he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him .
it will not sound to him strange , as to many others , much less disagreeable ; for I might , if it did not sound conceited , contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the U@@ pan@@ ish@@ ads , may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunci@@ ate , though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there .

<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er saw Bruno and Spin@@ oza as unique philosophers who were not bound to their age or nation .
&quot; both were fulfilled by the thought , that as manifold the appearances of the world may be , it is still &quot; one &quot; being , that appears in all of them . ... Con@@ sequ@@ ently , there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy , but God is the world itself . &quot; Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er expressed his regret that Spin@@ oza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of schol@@ as@@ ticism and Car@@ te@@ sian philosophy , and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of the vagueness and wid@@ eness of the definitions .
it is the common preference of philosophers of abstraction over perception .
Bruno on the other hand , who knew much about nature and ancient literature , presents his ideas with Italian vivi@@ dness , and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato &apos;s poetic and dramatic power of exposition .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics , and it is therefore very remarkable that Spin@@ oza called his main work &quot; Ethics &quot; .
in fact , it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life @-@ affirmation , if one completely ignores morality and self @-@ denial .
it is yet even more remarkable that Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er mentions Spin@@ oza as an example of the denial of the will , if one uses the French biography by Jean Maxim@@ ili@@ en Lucas as the key to &quot; T@@ rac@@ t@@ atus de Int@@ ellec@@ tus E@@ mend@@ ati@@ one &quot; .
</p>
<p>
the importance of Kant for Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , in philosophy as well as on a personal level , can hardly be overstated .
the philosophy of Kant was the foundation of his own .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and Plato , as C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us to H@@ ic@@ etas , Phil@@ ol@@ aus , and Ari@@ star@@ ch@@ us :
Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted .
in his study room one bust was of Buddha , the other was of Kant .
the bond which Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er felt with the philosopher of Kö@@ nig@@ sberg may be esteemed in a poem he dedicated to Kant :
with my eyes I followed thee into the blue sky , And there thy flight dissolved from view .
alone I stayed in the crowd below , Thy word and thy book my only solace . - Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er dedicated one fifth of his main work , &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; , to a criticism of the K@@ anti@@ an philosophy .
</p>
<p>
the leading figures of post @-@ K@@ anti@@ an philosophy , F@@ ich@@ te , Sch@@ elling and Heg@@ el , were not respected by Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er .
he argued that they were no philosophers at all , who merely sought to impress the public .
all this explains the painful impression with which we are seized when , after studying genuine thinkers , we come to the writings of F@@ ich@@ te and Sch@@ elling , or even to the presum@@ p@@ tuously scri@@ bbled nonsense of Heg@@ el , produced as it was with a boundless , though justified , confidence in German stupidity .
with those genuine thinkers one always found an &quot; honest &quot; investigation of truth and just as &quot; honest &quot; an attempt to communicate their ideas to others .
therefore whoever reads Kant , Locke , Hum@@ e , Mal@@ e@@ bran@@ che , Spin@@ oza , and Des@@ car@@ tes feels elevated and agre@@ eably impressed .
this is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awak@@ ens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking .
the reverse of all this takes place when we read the above @-@ mentioned three German sop@@ hists .
an unbiased reader , opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a char@@ lat@@ an wanting to impress , cannot be five minutes in any doubt ; here everything breath@@ es so much of &quot; dishonesty &quot; .
Sch@@ elling was deemed the most talented of the three , and Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er wrote that he would recommend his &quot; eluci@@ datory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of Kant &quot; concerning the intelligible character , if he had been honest enough to admit he was showing off with the thoughts of Kant , instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s favourite subject of attacks was Heg@@ el , whom he considered unworthy even of F@@ ich@@ te and Sch@@ elling .
whereas F@@ ich@@ te was merely a wind@@ bag , Heg@@ el was a &quot; stupid and clumsy char@@ lat@@ an . &quot; Karl Pop@@ per agreed with this distinction .
</p>
<p>
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er had a large pos@@ thum@@ ous effect and remained the most influential German philosopher until the First World War .
his philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers , which consisted of Julius Ba@@ hn@@ sen , Paul De@@ us@@ sen , Laz@@ ar von Hell@@ en@@ bach , Karl Robert Edu@@ ard von Hart@@ mann , Ernst Otto Lind@@ ner , Philip@@ p Main@@ l@@ än@@ der , Friedrich Nietzsche , Ol@@ ga Pl@@ ü@@ mac@@ her and Agnes Tal@@ bert .
his legacy shaped the intellectual debate , and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him , neo @-@ K@@ anti@@ anism and posi@@ tivism , to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored , and in doing so he changed them markedly .
the French writer Mau@@ pass@@ ant commented that &quot; to @-@ day even those who exec@@ rate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought . &quot; other philosophers of the 19th century who cited his influence include Hans V@@ ai@@ h@@ inger , Vol@@ kel@@ t , Sol@@ ov@@ y@@ ov and We@@ in@@ inger .
Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er was well read amongst physicists , most notably Einstein , Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger , Wolfgang Paul@@ i , and Maj@@ or@@ ana .
Einstein described Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s thoughts as a &quot; continual consolation &quot; and called him a genius .
in his Berlin study three figures hung on the wall : Far@@ ad@@ ay , Maxwell , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er .
Kon@@ rad W@@ ach@@ s@@ mann recalled : &quot; he often sat with one of the well @-@ worn Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er volumes , and as he sat there , he seemed so pleased , as if he were engaged with a serene and cheerful work . &quot; when Er@@ win Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger discovered Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy .
he maintained the idealistic views during the rest of his life .
Wolfgang Paul@@ i accepted the main tenet of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s metaphysics , that the thing @-@ in @-@ itself is will .
but most of all Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er is famous for his influence on artists .
Richard Wagner became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ erian philosophy .
the admiration was not mutual , and Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er proclaimed : &quot; I remain faithful to Ross@@ ini and Mozart ! &quot; so he has been nicknamed &quot; the artist &apos;s philosopher . &quot; see also Influence of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er on Tristan und Is@@ ol@@ de .
under the influence of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er Leo Tolstoy became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in self @-@ renunciation .
when he read his philosophy he exclaimed &quot; at present I am convinced that Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er is the greatest genius among men . ... It is the whole world in an in@@ compar@@ ably beautiful and clear reflection . &quot; he said that what he has written in &quot; War and Peace &quot; is also said by Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er in &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; .
Jorge Luis Bor@@ ges remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view , despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular , was because Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er had already written it for him .
other figures in literature who were strongly influenced by Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er were Thomas Man@@ n , Af@@ an@@ asy F@@ et , J.@@ -@@ K. Hu@@ ys@@ mans and George San@@ ta@@ yana .
Sergei Pro@@ ko@@ fi@@ ev , although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism , became fascinated with Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er after reading &quot; A@@ ph@@ or@@ isms on the Wisdom of Life &quot; in &quot; Par@@ erga and Par@@ al@@ ip@@ omen@@ a . &quot; &quot; with his truths Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness . &quot; Friedrich Nietzsche owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading &quot; The World as Will and Representation &quot; and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected , dedicating to him his essay &quot; Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er als Er@@ zi@@ e@@ her &quot; one of his &quot; Un@@ timely Med@@ itations &quot; .
as a teenager , Lud@@ wig W@@ itt@@ gen@@ stein adopted Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s epistem@@ ological idealism .
however , after his study of the philosophy of mathematics , he rejected epistem@@ ological transcendental idealism for Got@@ t@@ lo@@ b F@@ reg@@ e &apos;s conceptual realism .
in later years , W@@ itt@@ gen@@ stein was highly dismis@@ sive of Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker :
&quot; Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er has quite a crude mind ... where real depth starts , his comes to an end . &quot; his friend Bertrand Russell had a low opinion on the philosopher , and attacked him in his famous &quot; History of Western Philosophy &quot; for hypo@@ critically praising as@@ ce@@ ticism yet not acting upon it .
on the opposite is@@ le of Russell on the foundations of mathematics , the Dutch mathematician L. E. J. B@@ rou@@ wer incorporated the ideas of Kant and Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er in intu@@ i@@ tionism , where mathematics is considered a purely mental activity , instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed .
B@@ rou@@ wer was also influenced by Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er &apos;s metaphysics , and wrote an essay on mys@@ ticism .

Albert Sid@@ ney Johnston served as a general in three different armies : the Tex@@ ian Army , the United States Army , and the Confederate States Army .
he saw extensive combat during his 34 @-@ year military career , fighting actions in the Black Haw@@ k War , the Texas War of Independence , the Mexican @-@ American War , the Utah War , and the American Civil War .
considered by Confederate States President Jefferson Davis to be the finest general officer in the Confeder@@ acy before the later emergence of Robert E. Lee , he was killed early in the Civil War at the Battle of Shil@@ oh on April 6 , 18@@ 62 .
Johnston was the highest @-@ ranking officer , Union or Confederate , killed during the entire war .
Davis believed the loss of General Johnston &quot; was the turning point of our fate . &quot; Johnston was unrelated to Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston .
</p>
<p>
Johnston was born in Washington , Kentucky , the youngest son of Dr. John and Ab@@ ig@@ ail Johnston .
his father was a native of Sal@@ is@@ bury , Connecticut .
although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky , he lived much of his life in Texas , which he considered his home .
he was first educated at Tran@@ sylvania University in Lex@@ ington , Kentucky , where he met fellow student Jefferson Davis .
both were appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point , New York , Davis two years behind Johnston .
in 18@@ 26 , Johnston graduated eighth of 41 cadets in his class from West Point with a commission as a bre@@ vet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Infantry .
Johnston was assigned to posts in New York and Missouri and served in the brief Black Haw@@ k War in 18@@ 32 as chief of staff to B@@ vt .
Bri@@ g. Gen. Henry At@@ kinson .
</p>
<p>
in 18@@ 29 he married Henri@@ etta Pre@@ ston , sister of Kentucky politician and future Civil War general William Pre@@ ston .
they had one son , William Pre@@ ston Johnston , who became a colonel in the Confederate States Army .
the senior Johnston resigned his commission in 18@@ 34 in order to care for his dying wife in Kentucky , who succumbed two years later to tuberculosis .
after serving as Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas from 18@@ 38 to 1840 , Johnston resigned and returned to Kentucky .
in 18@@ 43 , he married Eliza Griffin , his late wife &apos;s first cousin .
the couple moved to Texas , where they settled on a large plantation in Braz@@ oria County .
Johnston named the property &quot; China Gro@@ ve . &quot; here they raised Johnston &apos;s two children from his first marriage and the first three children born to Eliza and him . .
</p>
<p>
in 18@@ 36 Johnston moved to Texas .
he enlisted as a private in the Tex@@ ian Army during the Texas War of Independence against the Republic of Mexico .
he was named Adj@@ ut@@ ant General as a colonel in the Republic of Texas Army on August 5 , 18@@ 36 .
on January 31 , 18@@ 37 , he became senior bri@@ gadier general in command of the Texas Army .
on February 5 , 18@@ 37 , he fought in a duel with Texas Bri@@ g. Gen. Felix H@@ ust@@ on , as they challenged each other for the command of the Texas Army ;
Johnston refused to fire on H@@ ust@@ on and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis .
on December 22 , 18@@ 38 , Mira@@ be@@ au B. Lam@@ ar , the second president of the Republic of Texas , appointed Johnston as Secretary of War .
he provided for the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion , and in 18@@ 39 conducted a campaign against Indians in northern Texas .
in February 1840 , he resigned and returned to Kentucky .
</p>
<p>
Johnston returned to Texas during the Mexican @-@ American War , under General Zach@@ ary Taylor as a colonel of the 1st Texas Rif@@ le Volunteers .
the en@@ list@@ ments of his volunteers ran out just before the Battle of Monterrey .
Johnston convinced a few volunteers to stay and fight as he served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and Bu@@ ena Vista .
he remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by later 12th President Zach@@ ary Taylor to the U.S. Army as a major and was made a pay@@ master in December 18@@ 49 .
he served in that role for more than five years , making six tours , and traveling more than annually on the Indian frontier of Texas .
he served on the Texas frontier at Fort Mason and elsewhere in the West .
in 18@@ 55 , 14th President Franklin Pierce appointed him colonel of the new 2nd U.S. Caval@@ ry , a new regiment , which he organized .
on August 19 , 18@@ 56 , Gen. Per@@ si@@ for Smith , at the request of Kansas Territorial Governor Wilson Shannon , sent Col. Johnston with 1300 men composed of the 2@@ d Caval@@ ry Dra@@ go@@ ons from Fort Ril@@ ey , a battalion of the 6th Infantry and Cap@@ t. H@@ owe &apos;s artillery company from Jefferson Bar@@ racks , near St. Louis to protect the territorial capital at Lec@@ om@@ p@@ ton from an imminent attack by James Henry Lane and his abolitionist &quot; Army of the North . &quot;
</p>
<p>
as a key figure in the Utah War , Johnston led U.S. troops who established a non @-@ Mor@@ mon government in the Mor@@ mon territory .
he received a bre@@ vet promotion to bri@@ gadier general in 1857 for his service in Utah .
he spent 1860 in Kentucky until December 21 , when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific .
</p>
<p>
at the outbreak of the American Civil War , Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army Department of the Pacific in California .
like many regular army officers from the South , he was opposed to secession .
but he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of his adopted state of Texas .
it was accepted by the War Department on May 6 , 1861 , effective May 3 .
on April 28 he moved to Los Angeles , the home of his wife &apos;s brother John Griffin .
considering staying in California with his wife and five children , Johnston remained there until May .
soon , under suspicion by local Union officials , he evaded arrest and joined the Los Angeles Moun@@ ted Rif@@ les as a private , leaving Warner &apos;s Ran@@ ch May 27 .
he participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to Texas , crossing the Colorado River into the Confederate Territory of Arizona on July 4 , 1861 .
early in the Civil War , Confederate President Jefferson Davis decided that the Confeder@@ acy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible , and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts .
in the summer of 1861 , Davis appointed several generals to defend Confederate lines from the Mississippi River east to the Al@@ le@@ gh@@ en@@ y Mountains .
the most sensitive , and in many ways the most crucial areas , along the Mississippi River and in western Tennessee along the Tennessee and the Cumber@@ land rivers were placed under the command of Maj@@ . Gen. Leon@@ id@@ as Pol@@ k and Bri@@ g. Gen. Gideon J. Pil@@ low .
the latter had initially been in command in Tennessee as that State &apos;s top general .
their im@@ politic occupation of Columbus , Kentucky , on September 3 , 1861 , two days before Johnston arrived in the Confeder@@ acy &apos;s capital of Richmond , Virginia , after his cross @-@ country journey , drove Kentucky from its stated neutrality .
the majority of Kentu@@ ck@@ ians allied with the Union camp .
Pol@@ k and Pil@@ low &apos;s action gave Union Bri@@ g. Gen. Ul@@ ys@@ ses S. Grant an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of Pad@@ u@@ ca@@ h , Kentucky , without raising the ire of most Kentu@@ ck@@ ians and the pro @-@ Union majority in the State legislature .
</p>
<p>
on September 10 , 1861 , Johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the Confeder@@ acy west of the Al@@ le@@ gh@@ en@@ y Mountains , except for coastal areas .
he became commander of the Confeder@@ acy &apos;s western armies in the area often called the Western Department or Western Military Department .
Johnston &apos;s appointment as a full general by his friend and admirer Jefferson Davis already had been confirmed by the Confederate Senate on August 31 , 1861 .
the appointment had been back@@ dated to rank from May 30 , 1861 , making him the second highest ranking general in the Confederate States Army .
only Adj@@ ut@@ ant General and Inspector General Samuel Cooper ranked ahead of him .
after his appointment , Johnston immediately headed for his new territory .
he was permitted to call on governors of Arkansas , Tennessee and Mississippi for new troops , although this authority was largely stifled by politics , especially with respect to Mississippi .
on September 13 , 1861 , Johnston ordered Bri@@ g. Gen. Felix Z@@ ol@@ lic@@ offer with 4,000 men to occupy Cumber@@ land Gap in Kentucky in order to block Union troops from coming into eastern Tennessee .
the Kentucky legislature had voted to side with the Union after the occupation of Columbus by Pol@@ k .
by September 18 , Johnston had Bri@@ g. Gen. Simon Bol@@ iv@@ ar Buck@@ ner with another 4,000 men blocking the railroad route to Tennessee at Bow@@ ling Green , Kentucky .
Johnston had fewer than 40,000 men spread throughout Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas and Missouri .
of these , 10,000 were in Missouri under Missouri State Guard Maj@@ . Gen. Ster@@ ling Price .
Johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors , but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had .
as the Confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the East , they gave Johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material .
Johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did , a strategy that worked for several months .
Johnston &apos;s tactics had so annoyed and confused Union Bri@@ g. Gen. William Tec@@ um@@ seh Sherman in Kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable .
Sherman overestimated Johnston &apos;s forces , and had to be relieved by Bri@@ g. Gen. Don Carlos Bu@@ ell on November 9 , 1861 .
</p>
<p>
East Tennessee was held for the Confeder@@ acy by two un@@ impressive bri@@ gadier generals appointed by Jefferson Davis :
Felix Z@@ ol@@ lic@@ offer , a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer , and soon @-@ to @-@ be Maj@@ . Gen. George B. Crit@@ ten@@ den , a former U.S. Army officer with apparent alcohol problems .
while Crit@@ ten@@ den was away in Richmond , Z@@ ol@@ lic@@ offer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper Cumber@@ land River near Mill Springs , putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap .
Z@@ ol@@ lic@@ offer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of Union troops .
when Union Bri@@ g. Gen. George H. Thomas moved against the Confeder@@ ates , Crit@@ ten@@ den decided to attack one of the two parts of Thomas &apos;s command at Logan &apos;s Cross Roads near Mill Springs before the Union forces could unite .
at the Battle of Mill Springs on January 19 , 18@@ 62 , the ill @-@ prepared Confeder@@ ates , after a night march in the rain , attacked the Union force with some initial success .
as the battle progressed , Z@@ ol@@ lic@@ offer was killed , Crit@@ ten@@ den was unable to lead the Confederate force , and the Confeder@@ ates were turned back and routed by a Union bay@@ onet charge , suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4,000 .
the Confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as General Crit@@ ten@@ den faced an investigation of his conduct .
after the Confederate defeat at the Mill Springs , Davis sent Johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements .
he also assigned him Gen. P. G. T. Beau@@ regard , who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war , and act as a competent subordinate for Johnston .
the brigade was led by Bri@@ g. Gen. John B. F@@ loy@@ d , considered incompetent .
he took command at Fort Don@@ elson as the senior general present just before Union Bri@@ g. Gen. Ul@@ ys@@ ses S. Grant attacked the fort .
historians believe the assignment of Beau@@ regard to the west stimulated Union commanders to attack the forts before Beau@@ regard could make a difference in the theater .
Union officers heard that he was bringing 15 regi@@ ments with him , but this was an exaggeration of his forces .
</p>
<p>
based on the assumption that Kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north , circumstances that no longer applied in September 1861 , Tennessee initially had sent men to Virginia and concentrated defenses in the Mississippi Valley .
even before Johnston arrived in Tennessee , construction of two forts had been started to defend the Tennessee and the Cumber@@ land rivers , which provided avenues into the State from the north .
both forts were located in Tennessee in order to respect Kentucky neutrality , but these were not in ideal locations .
Fort Henry on the Tennessee River was in an unfavorable low @-@ lying location , commanded by hills on the Kentucky side of the river .
Fort Don@@ elson on the Cumber@@ land River , although in a better location , had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gun@@ boats .
Maj@@ . Gen. Pol@@ k ignored the problems of the forts when he took command .
after Johnston took command , Pol@@ k at first refused to comply with Johnston &apos;s order to send an engineer , Lt. Joseph K. Di@@ xon , to inspect the forts .
after Johnston asserted his authority , Pol@@ k had to allow Di@@ xon to proceed .
Di@@ xon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened , although they were not in ideal locations , because much work had been done on them and the Confeder@@ ates might not have time to build new ones .
Johnston accepted his recommendations .
Johnston wanted Major Alexander P. Stewart to command the forts but President Davis appointed Bri@@ g. Gen. Lloyd Til@@ gh@@ man as commander .
to prevent Pol@@ k from dissip@@ ating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group , Johnston ordered him to send Bri@@ g. Gen. Gideon Pil@@ low and 5,000 men to Fort Don@@ elson .
pillow took up a position at nearby Clar@@ ks@@ ville , Tennessee and did not move into the fort until February 7 , 18@@ 62 .
alerted by a Union reconnaissance on January 14 , 18@@ 62 , Johnston ordered Til@@ gh@@ man to fortify the high ground opposite Fort Henry , which Pol@@ k had failed to do despite Johnston &apos;s orders .
Til@@ gh@@ man failed to act decisively on these orders , which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out .
Gen. Beau@@ regard arrived at Johnston &apos;s headquarters at Bow@@ ling Green on February 4 , 18@@ 62 , and was given overall command of Pol@@ k &apos;s force at the western end of Johnston &apos;s line at Columbus , Kentucky .
on February 6 , 18@@ 62 , Union Navy gun@@ boats quickly reduced the defenses of ill @-@ s@@ ited Fort Henry , inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining Confederate force .
Bri@@ g. Gen. Lloyd Til@@ gh@@ man surrendered the 94 remaining officers and men of his approximately 3,000 @-@ man force which had not been sent to Fort Don@@ elson before U.S. Grant &apos;s force could even take up their positions .
Johnston knew he could be trapped at Bow@@ ling Green if Fort Don@@ elson fell , so he moved his force to Nash@@ ville , the capital of Tennessee and an increasingly important Confederate industrial center , beginning on February 11 , 18@@ 62 .
Johnston also reinforced Fort Don@@ elson with 12,000 more men , including those under F@@ loy@@ d and Pil@@ low , a curious decision in view of his thought that the Union gun@@ boats alone might be able to take the fort .
he did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held .
the senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison , Gideon J. Pil@@ low and John B. F@@ loy@@ d , squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on February 16 , 18@@ 62 , Bri@@ g. Gen. Simon Buck@@ ner , having been abandoned by F@@ loy@@ d and Pil@@ low , surrendered Fort Don@@ elson .
Colonel Nathan Bed@@ ford Forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about 700 men before the surrender .
the Confeder@@ ates suffered about 1,500 casualties with an estimated 12,000 to 14,000 taken prisoner .
Union casualties were 500 killed , 2,@@ 108 wounded , 224 missing .
Johnston , who had little choice in allowing F@@ loy@@ d and Pil@@ low to take charge at Fort Don@@ elson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison , took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the Confederate position .
his passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at Bow@@ ling Green , spreading his forces too thinly , not concentrating his forces in the face of Union advances , and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians .
the fall of the forts exposed Nash@@ ville to imminent attack , and it fell without resistance to Union forces under Bri@@ g. Gen. Bu@@ ell on February 25 , 18@@ 62 , two days after Johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well .
</p>
<p>
Johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off .
Johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command , the Army of Central Kentucky , from the vicinity of Nash@@ ville .
with Beau@@ regard &apos;s help , Johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under Pol@@ k and now already under Beau@@ regard &apos;s command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of Corin@@ th , Mississippi , which he reached by a circu@@ itous route .
Johnston kept the Union forces , now under the overall command of the ponder@@ ous Maj@@ . Gen. Henry Hall@@ eck , confused and hesitant to move , allowing Johnston to reach his objective undetected .
this delay allowed Jefferson Davis finally to send reinforcements from the gar@@ ris@@ ons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prick@@ ly general , Bra@@ x@@ ton Bra@@ gg , to help organize the western forces .
Bra@@ gg at least calmed the nerves of Beau@@ regard and Pol@@ k , who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces , before Johnston &apos;s arrival on March 24 , 18@@ 62 .
Johnston &apos;s army of 17,000 men gave the Confeder@@ ates a combined force of about 40,000 to 44,@@ 669 men at Corin@@ th .
on March 29 , 18@@ 62 , Johnston officially took command of this combined force , which continued to use the Army of the Mississippi name under which it had been organized by Beau@@ regard on March 5 .
Johnston now planned to defeat the Union forces piecemeal before the various Union units in Kentucky and Tennessee under Grant with 40,000 men at nearby Pitt@@ sburg Lan@@ ding , Tennessee , and the now Maj@@ . Gen. Don Carlos Bu@@ ell on his way from Nash@@ ville with 35,000 men , could unite against him .
Johnston started his army in motion on April 3 , 18@@ 62 , intent on surprising Grant &apos;s force as soon as the next day , but they moved slowly due to their inexperience , bad roads , and lack of adequate staff planning .
Johnston decided to proceed as planned , stating &quot; I would fight them if they were a million . &quot; his army was finally in position within a mile or two of Grant &apos;s force , and undetected , by the evening of April 5 , 18@@ 62 .
</p>
<p>
Johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against Grant at the Battle of Shil@@ oh on April 6 , 18@@ 62 .
as the Confederate forces over@@ ran the Union camps , Johnston seemed to be everywhere , personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse .
at about 2 : 30 pm , while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the &quot; P@@ each Or@@ chard , &quot; he was wounded , taking a bullet behind his right knee .
he apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time , or even possibly did not feel it .
it is possible that Johnston &apos;s duel in 18@@ 37 had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result .
the bullet had in fact cl@@ ipped a part of his popl@@ it@@ eal artery and his boot was filling up with blood .
there were no medical personnel on scene at the time , since Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners earlier in the battle .
within a few minutes , Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fain@@ ting .
among his staff was Is@@ ham G. Harris , the Governor of Tennessee , who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that Abraham Lincoln had appointed Andrew Johnson as military governor of Tennessee .
seeing Johnston slum@@ ping in his saddle and his face turning dea@@ thly pale , Harris asked :
&quot; General , are you wounded ? &quot; Johnston glanced down at his leg wound , then faced Harris and replied in a weak voice his last words :
&quot; yes ... and I fear seriously . &quot; Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ra@@ vine near the &quot; Hor@@ nets Nest &quot; and desperately tried to aid the general who had lost consciousness by this point .
Harris then sent an aide to fetch Johnston &apos;s surgeon but did not apply a tour@@ ni@@ quet to Johnson &apos;s wounded leg .
before a doctor could be found , Johnston died from blood loss a few minutes later .
it is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound .
ironically , it was later discovered that Johnston had a tour@@ ni@@ quet in his pocket when he died .
Harris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston &apos;s body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops &apos; morale with the sight of the dead general .
Johnston and his wounded horse , Fire E@@ ater , were taken to his field headquarters on the Corin@@ th road , where his body remained in his tent until the Confederate Army withdrew to Corin@@ th the next day , April 7 , 18@@ 62 , after failing to gain a decisive victory over the Union armies .
from there , his body was taken to the home of Colonel William In@@ ge , which had been his headquarters in Corin@@ th .
it was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours .
it is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round .
no Union soldiers had ever been observed to have gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge , but it is known that many Confeder@@ ates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers .
furthermore , the surgeon who later dug the bullet out of Johnston &apos;s leg identified the round as one fired from a Pattern 18@@ 53 En@@ field .
no Union troops in the area in which Johnston was hit had been issued En@@ field rifles , but the En@@ field rifle was standard issue for the Confederate forces Johnston was leading .
Johnston was the highest @-@ ranking fatality of the war on either side , and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the Confeder@@ acy .
at the time , Davis considered him the best general in the country .
</p>
<p>
Johnston was survived by his wife Eliza and six children .
his wife and five younger children , including one born after he went to war , chose to live out their days at home in Los Angeles with Eliza &apos;s brother , Dr. John Stro@@ ther Griffin .
Johnston &apos;s eldest son , Albert Sid@@ ney Jr . , had already followed him into the Confederate States Army .
in 1863 , after taking home leave in Los Angeles , Albert J@@ r. was on his way out of San Pedro harbor on a ferry .
while a steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry , a wave swamped the smaller boat , causing its boilers to explode .
Albert J@@ r. was killed in the accident .
killed in action , General Johnston received the highest praise ever given by the Confederate government : accounts were published , on December 20 , 18@@ 62 , and thereafter , in the Los Angeles &quot; Star &quot; of his family &apos;s hometown .
Johnston Street , Han@@ cock Street , and Griffin Avenue , each in northeast Los Angeles , are named after the general and his family , who lived in the neighborhood .
Johnston was initially buried in New Orleans .
in 1866 , a joint resolution of the Texas Legislature was passed to have his body moved and re@@ inter@@ red at the Texas State Cemetery in Austin .
the re @-@ inter@@ ment occurred in 1867 .
forty years later , the state appointed Elis@@ abet N@@ ey to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the grave site , installed in 1905 .
the Texas Historical Commission has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once Johnston &apos;s plantation .
an adjacent marker was erected by the San Jac@@ into Chapter of the Dau@@ ghters of The Republic of Texas and the Lee , Roberts , and Davis Chapter of the United Dau@@ ghters of the Confederate States of America .
in 1916 , the University of Texas at Austin recognized several con@@ feder@@ ate veterans with statues on its South Mall .
on August 21 , 2017 , as part of the wave of con@@ feder@@ ate monument removals in America , Johnston &apos;s statue was taken down .
plans were announced to add it to the Bris@@ coe Center for American History on the east side of the university campus .

Albert Einstein was a German @-@ born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity , one of the two pillars of modern physics .
his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science .
he is best known to the general public for his mass @-@ energy equivalence formula , which has been dubbed &quot; the world &apos;s most famous equation . &quot; he received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot; for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect , &quot; a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory .
near the beginning of his career , Einstein thought that New@@ tonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field .
this led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern , Switzerland .
however , he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields , and he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 with his theory of gravitation .
he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory , which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules .
he also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light .
in 1917 , he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe .
except for one year in Prague , Einstein lived in Switzerland between 18@@ 95 and 1914 , during which time he renounced his German citizenship in 1896 , then received his academic diploma from the Swiss federal poly@@ technic school in Z@@ ü@@ rich in 1900 .
after being stateless for more than five years , he acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901 , which he kept for the rest of his life .
in 1905 , he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich .
the same year , he published four groundbreaking papers during his renowned &quot; ann@@ us mi@@ ra@@ bil@@ is &quot; which brought him to the notice of the academic world at the age of 26 .
Einstein taught theoretical physics at Zurich between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin , where he was elected to the Pr@@ ussian Academy of Sciences .
in 1933 , while Einstein was visiting the United States , Ad@@ olf Hitler came to power .
because of his Jewish background , Einstein did not return to Germany .
he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940 .
on the eve of World War II , he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential development of &quot; extremely powerful bombs of a new type &quot; and recommending that the US begin similar research .
this eventually led to the Manhattan Project .
Einstein supported the Allies , but he generally denounced the idea of using nuclear fission as a weapon .
he signed the Russell @-@ Einstein Manif@@ esto with British philosopher Bertrand Russell , which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons .
he was affiliated with the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey , until his death in 1955 .
Einstein published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non @-@ scientific works .
his intellectual achievements and originality have made the word &quot; Einstein &quot; synonymous with &quot; genius . &quot; Eugene W@@ ig@@ ner wrote of Einstein in comparison to his contemporaries that &quot; Einstein &apos;s understanding was deeper even than J@@ anc@@ si von Ne@@ um@@ ann &apos;s . his mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Ne@@ um@@ ann &apos;s . and that is a very remarkable statement . &quot;

Albert Einstein was born in Ul@@ m , in the Kingdom of W@@ ür@@ tt@@ ember@@ g in the German Empire , on 14 March 18@@ 79 .
his parents were Her@@ mann Einstein , a salesman and engineer , and Pauline Ko@@ ch .
in 1880 , the family moved to Munich , where Einstein &apos;s father and his uncle Jak@@ ob founded &quot; Ele@@ k@@ tro@@ techn@@ ische Fab@@ rik J. Einstein &amp; C@@ ie &quot; , a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current .
the E@@ inste@@ ins were non @-@ observant Ash@@ ken@@ azi Jews , and Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich , from the age of 5 , for three years .
at the age of 8 , he was transferred to the Lu@@ it@@ po@@ ld Gym@@ n@@ asium , where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later .
in 1894 , Her@@ mann and Jak@@ ob &apos;s company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current standard to the more efficient alternating current standard .
the loss forced the sale of the Munich factory .
in search of business , the Einstein family moved to Italy , first to Milan and a few months later to Pa@@ via .
when the family moved to Pa@@ via , Einstein , then 15 , stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Lu@@ it@@ po@@ ld Gym@@ n@@ asium .
his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering , but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school &apos;s regimen and teaching method .
he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning .
at the end of December 1894 , he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pa@@ via , convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor &apos;s note .
during his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title &quot; On the Investigation of the State of the E@@ ther in a Magnetic Field . &quot; Einstein always exc@@ elled at math and physics from a young age , reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers .
the twelve year old Einstein taught himself algebra and Eu@@ cl@@ ide@@ an geometry over a single summer .
Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Py@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ ean theorem at age 12 .
&quot; at the time he was still a child , only thirteen years old , yet Kant &apos;s works , incomprehensible to ordinary mortals , seemed to be clear to him . &quot; in 18@@ 95 , at the age of 16 , Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Z@@ ü@@ rich .
he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination , but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics .
on the advice of the principal of the Polytechnic , he attended the Ar@@ go@@ vian cantonal school in Aar@@ au , Switzerland , in 18@@ 95 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling .
while lodging with the family of professor Jo@@ st W@@ int@@ eler , he fell in love with W@@ int@@ eler &apos;s daughter , Marie .
Albert &apos;s sister Ma@@ ja later married W@@ int@@ eler &apos;s son Paul .
in January 1896 , with his father &apos;s approval , Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of W@@ ür@@ tt@@ ember@@ g to avoid military service .
in September 1896 , he passed the Swiss Mat@@ ura with mostly good grades , including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects , on a scale of 1 @-@ 6 .
at 17 , he enrolled in the four @-@ year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Z@@ ü@@ rich Polytechnic .
Marie W@@ int@@ eler , who was a year older , moved to Ol@@ sberg , Switzerland , for a teaching post .
Einstein &apos;s future wife , a 20 @-@ year old Serbian woman Mil@@ eva Mari@@ ć , also enrolled at the Polytechnic that year .
she was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course .
over the next few years , Einstein and Mari@@ ć &apos;s friendship developed into romance , and they read books together on extra @-@ curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest .
in 1900 , Einstein passed the exams in Ma@@ ths and Physics and was awarded the Federal Polytechnic teaching diploma .
there have been claims that Mari@@ ć collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers , known as the &quot; Ann@@ us Mira@@ bil@@ is &quot; papers , but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions .
</p>
<p>
an early correspondence between Einstein and Mari@@ ć was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named &quot; Li@@ es@@ er@@ l , &quot; born in early 19@@ 02 in Novi S@@ ad where Mari@@ ć was staying with her parents .
Mari@@ ć returned to Switzerland without the child , whose real name and fate are unknown .
the contents of Einstein &apos;s letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy .
Einstein and Mari@@ ć married in January 1903 .
in May 1904 , their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern , Switzerland .
their son Edu@@ ard was born in Z@@ ü@@ rich in July 1910 .
the couple moved to Berlin in April 1914 , but Mari@@ ć returned to Z@@ ü@@ rich with their sons after learning that Einstein &apos;s chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin Elsa .
they divorced on 14 February 1919 , having lived apart for five years .
Edu@@ ard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia .
his mother cared for him and he was also committed to asyl@@ ums for several periods , finally being committed permanently after her death .
in letters revealed in 2015 , Einstein wrote to his early love Marie W@@ int@@ eler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her .
he wrote in 1910 , while his wife was pregnant with their second child :
&quot; I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be . &quot; he spoke about a &quot; misguided love &quot; and a &quot; missed life &quot; regarding his love for Marie .
Einstein married Elsa L@@ ö@@ wen@@ thal in 1919 , after having a relationship with her since 1912 .
she was a first cousin mater@@ nally and a second cousin pater@@ nally .
they emigrated to the United States in 1933 .
Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936 .
</p>
<p>
among Einstein &apos;s well @-@ known friends were Michel@@ e Bes@@ so , Paul E@@ h@@ ren@@ f@@ est , Marcel Gro@@ ss@@ mann , J@@ á@@ nos Ples@@ ch , Daniel Q. Po@@ sin , Maurice Sol@@ ov@@ ine , and Stephen Wise .
</p>
<p>
after graduating in 1900 , Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post .
he acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901 , but for medical reasons was not con@@ scripted .
with the help of Marcel Gro@@ ss@@ mann &apos;s father , he secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property , the patent office , as an assistant examiner - level III .
Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sor@@ ter and an electromechanical typewriter .
in 1903 , his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent , although he was passed over for promotion until he &quot; fully mastered machine technology . &quot; much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical @-@ mechanical synchronization of time , two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time .
with a few friends he had met in Bern , Einstein started a small discussion group in 19@@ 02 , self @-@ mock@@ ingly named &quot; The Olympia Academy , &quot; which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy .
their readings included the works of Henri Po@@ incar@@ é , Ernst M@@ ach , and David Hum@@ e , which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook .
</p>
<p>
in 1900 , Einstein &apos;s paper &quot; Fol@@ ger@@ un@@ gen aus den Cap@@ ill@@ ar@@ it@@ ä@@ t@@ ser@@ sch@@ e@@ inun@@ gen &quot; was published in the journal &quot; Ann@@ al@@ en der Physi@@ k &quot; .
on 30 April 1905 , Einstein completed his thesis , with Alfred Kle@@ iner , Professor of Experimental Physics , serving as &quot; pro @-@ forma &quot; advisor .
as a result , Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Z@@ ü@@ rich , with his dissertation &quot; &quot; A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions &quot; . &quot; in that same year , which has been called Einstein &apos;s &quot; ann@@ us mi@@ ra@@ bil@@ is &quot; , he published four groundbreaking papers , on the photoelectric effect , Brow@@ nian motion , special relativity , and the equivalence of mass and energy , which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world , at the age of 26 .
</p>
<p>
by 1908 , he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern .
the following year , after giving a lecture on electro@@ dynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Z@@ ü@@ rich , Alfred Kle@@ iner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created profess@@ orship in theoretical physics .
Einstein was appointed associate professor in 19@@ 09 .
Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles @-@ Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911 , accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austr@@ o @-@ Hungarian Empire to do so .
during his Prague stay , he wrote 11 scientific works , five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids .
in July 1912 , he returned to his alma mater in Z@@ ü@@ rich .
from 1912 until 1914 , he was professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich , where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics .
he also studied continuum mechanics , the molecular theory of heat , and the problem of gravitation , on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Gro@@ ss@@ mann .
on 3 July 19@@ 13 , he was voted for membership in the Pr@@ ussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin .
Max Planck and Wal@@ ther N@@ ern@@ st visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy , additionally offering him the post of director at the Ka@@ iser Wilhelm Institute for Physics , which was soon to be established .
he was officially elected to the academy on 24 July , and he accepted to move to the German Empire the next year .
his decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa , with whom he had developed a romantic affair .
he joined the academy and thus the Berlin University on 1 April 1914 .
as World War I broke out that year , the plan for Ka@@ iser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted .
the institute was established on 1 October 1917 , with Einstein as its director .
in 1916 , Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society .
based on calculations Einstein made in 1911 , about his new theory of general relativity , light from another star should be bent by the Sun &apos;s gravity .
in 1919 , that prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Ed@@ d@@ ington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 .
those observations were published in the international media , making Einstein world @-@ famous .
on 7 November 1919 , the leading British newspaper &quot; The Times &quot; printed a banner headline that read :
&quot; Revolution in Science - New Theory of the Universe - New@@ tonian Ideas Over@@ thrown . &quot; in 1920 , he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences .
in 1922 , he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot; for his services to Theoretical Physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect . &quot; while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial , the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an &quot; explanation &quot; but merely as a &quot; discovery of the law &quot; , as the idea of photons was considered out@@ lan@@ dish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bo@@ se .
Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1921 .
he also received the Co@@ ple@@ y Medal from the Royal Society in 1925 .
</p>
<p>
Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921 , where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis H@@ ylan , followed by three weeks of lectures and recep@@ tions .
he went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University , and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House .
on his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Vis@@ count Hal@@ dane in London , where he met several renowned scientific , intellectual and political figures , and delivered a lecture at King &apos;s College London .
he also published an essay , &quot; My First Im@@ pression of the U.S.A. , &quot; in July 1921 , in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans , much as had Alexis de T@@ oc@@ qu@@ eville , who published his own impressions in &quot; Democracy in America &quot; .
for some of his observations , Einstein was clearly surprised :
&quot; what strikes a visitor is the joyous , positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly , self @-@ confident , optimistic , and without envy . &quot; in 1922 , his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine , as part of a six @-@ month excursion and speaking tour , as he visited Singapore , Cey@@ lon and Japan , where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese .
after his first public lecture , he met the emperor and em@@ press at the Imperial Palace , where thousands came to watch .
in a letter to his sons , he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest , intelligent , considerate , and having a true feel for art .
in his own travel diaries from his 1922 @-@ 23 visit to Asia , he expresses some views on the Chinese , Japanese and Indian people , which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were re@@ discovered in 2018 .
because of Einstein &apos;s travels to the Far East , he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922 .
in his place , the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat , who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peac@@ emaker and activist .
on his return voyage , he visited Palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region .
he was greeted as if he were a head of state , rather than a physicist , which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner , Sir Herbert Samuel .
during one reception , the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him .
in Einstein &apos;s talk to the audience , he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world .
Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923 , where he briefly met Santiago Ramón y Ca@@ j@@ al and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences .
from 1922 to 1932 , Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva , a body created to promote international exchange between scientists , researchers , teachers , artists and intellectuals .
originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate , Secretary @-@ General Eric Dr@@ um@@ mond was persuaded by Catholic activists O@@ sk@@ ar Hal@@ ec@@ ki and Gi@@ us@@ eppe Mot@@ ta to instead have him become the German delegate , thus allowing Gonz@@ ague de Reyn@@ old to take the Swiss spot , from which he promoted tradition@@ alist Catholic values .
Einstein &apos;s former physics professor Hend@@ rik Lor@@ ent@@ z and the French chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee .
</p>
<p>
in December 1930 , Einstein visited America for the second time , originally intended as a two @-@ month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology .
after the national attention he received during his first trip to the US , he and his arran@@ gers aimed to protect his privacy .
although swamped with teleg@@ rams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly , he declined them all .
after arriving in New York City , Einstein was taken to various places and events , including Chinatown , a lunch with the editors of &quot; The New York Times &quot; , and a performance of &quot; Carmen &quot; at the Metropolitan Opera , where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival .
during the days following , he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University , who described Einstein as &quot; the ruling monarch of the mind . &quot; Harry Emerson Fos@@ dick , pastor at New York &apos;s River@@ side Church , gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full @-@ size statue that the church made of Einstein , standing at the entrance .
also during his stay in New York , he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a H@@ anu@@ k@@ kah celebration .
Einstein next traveled to California , where he met Cal@@ tech president and Nobel laureate , Robert A. Mil@@ lik@@ an .
his friendship with Mil@@ lik@@ an was &quot; awkward , &quot; as Mil@@ lik@@ an &quot; had a penchant for patriotic militarism , &quot; where Einstein was a pronounced pacif@@ ist .
during an address to Cal@@ tech &apos;s students , Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good .
this aversion to war also led Einstein to be@@ friend author Up@@ ton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin , both noted for their pacif@@ ism .
Carl La@@ em@@ m@@ le , head of Universal Stu@@ di@@ os , gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin .
they had an instant rapport , with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife , Elsa , to his home for dinner .
Chaplin said Einstein &apos;s outward persona , calm and gentle , seemed to conceal a &quot; highly emotional temperament , &quot; from which came his &quot; extraordinary intellectual energy . &quot; Chaplin &apos;s film , &quot; City Li@@ ghts &quot; , was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood , and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests .
Walter Isa@@ ac@@ son , Einstein &apos;s bi@@ ographer , described this as &quot; one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity . &quot; Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin , and recalled his &quot; modest little flat &quot; and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory .
Chaplin speculated that it was &quot; possibly used as kind@@ ling wood by the Nazis . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in February 1933 while on a visit to the United States , Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany &apos;s new chancellor , Ad@@ olf Hitler .
while at American universities in early 1933 , he undertook his third two @-@ month visiting profess@@ orship at the California Institute of Technology in Pas@@ ad@@ ena .
he and his wife Elsa returned to Belgium by ship in March , and during the trip they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sail@@ boat confiscated .
upon landing in Antwerp on 28 March , he immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport , formally renouncing his German citizenship .
the Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp .
</p>
<p>
in April 1933 , Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions , including teaching at universities .
historian Gerald Hol@@ ton describes how , with &quot; virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues , &quot; thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed .
a month later , Einstein &apos;s works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book bur@@ nings , with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s proclaiming , &quot; Jewish intellectu@@ alism is dead . &quot; one German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase , &quot; not yet hanged , &quot; offering a $ 5,000 bounty on his head .
in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born , who had already emigrated from Germany to England , Einstein wrote , ... &quot;
I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise . &quot; after moving to the US , he described the book bur@@ nings as a &quot; spontaneous emotional outburst &quot; by those who &quot; shun popular enlightenment , &quot; and &quot; more than anything else in the world , fear the influence of men of intellectual independence . &quot; Einstein was now without a permanent home , unsure where he would live and work , and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany .
he rented a house in De Ha@@ an , Belgium , where he lived for a few months .
in late July 1933 , he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Lock@@ er @-@ L@@ amp@@ son , who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years .
to protect Einstein , Lock@@ er @-@ L@@ amp@@ son had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London , with a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein , published in the &quot; Daily Herald &quot; on 24 July 1933 .
locker @-@ L@@ amp@@ son took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home , and later , Austen Chamber@@ lain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George .
Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany .
British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately , and sent his friend , physicist Frederick Lin@@ dem@@ ann , to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities .
Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out , they had lowered their &quot; technical standards &quot; and put the Allies &apos; technology ahead of theirs .
Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations , including Turkey &apos;s Prime Minister , İ@@ s@@ met İ@@ n@@ ö@@ n@@ ü , to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German @-@ Jewish scientists .
as a result of Einstein &apos;s letter , Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over &quot; 1,000 saved individuals . &quot; locker @-@ L@@ amp@@ son also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein , during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe .
in one of his speeches he denounced Germany &apos;s treatment of Jews , while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine , as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere .
in his speech he described Einstein as a &quot; citizen of the world &quot; who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK .
both bills failed , however , and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study , in Princeton , New Jersey , US , to become a resident scholar .
</p>
<p>
in October 1933 Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study , noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany .
at the time , most American universities , including Harvard , Princeton and Yale , had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students , as a result of their Jewish quotas , which lasted until the late 1940s .
Einstein was still undecided on his future .
he had offers from several European universities , including Christ Church , Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5 @-@ year stud@@ ent@@ ship , but in 1935 he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship .
Einstein &apos;s affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955 .
he was one of the four first selected at the new Institute , where he soon developed a close friendship with Gö@@ del .
the two would take long walks together discussing their work .
Bru@@ ria Kau@@ f@@ man , his assistant , later became a physicist .
during this period , Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics , both unsuccessfully .
</p>
<p>
in 1939 , a group of Hungarian scientists that included é@@ mig@@ ré physicist Le@@ ó Sz@@ il@@ á@@ rd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research .
the group &apos;s warnings were discounted .
Einstein and Sz@@ il@@ á@@ rd , along with other refugees such as Edward T@@ eller and Eugene W@@ ig@@ ner , &quot; regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb , and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon . &quot; to make certain the US was aware of the danger , in July 1939 , a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe , Sz@@ il@@ á@@ rd and W@@ ig@@ ner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs , which Einstein , a pacif@@ ist , said he had never considered .
he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter , with Sz@@ il@@ á@@ rd , to President Roosevelt , recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research .
the letter is believed to be &quot; arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II . &quot; in addition to the letter , Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House &apos;s O@@ val Office .
some say that as a result of Einstein &apos;s letter and his meetings with Roosevelt , the US entered the &quot; race &quot; to develop the bomb , drawing on its &quot; immense material , financial , and scientific resources &quot; to initiate the Manhattan Project .
for Einstein , &quot; war was a disease ... &#91; and &#93; he called for resistance to war . &quot; by signing the letter to Roosevelt , some argue he went against his pacif@@ ist principles .
in 1954 , a year before his death , Einstein said to his old friend , Lin@@ us Paul@@ ing , &quot; I made one great mistake in my life - when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made ; but there was some justification - the danger that the Germans would make them ... &quot;
</p>
<p>
Einstein became an American citizen in 1940 .
not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study , he expressed his appreciation of the merit@@ ocracy in American culture when compared to Europe .
he recognized the &quot; right of individuals to say and think what they pleased , &quot; without social barriers , and as a result , individuals were encouraged , he said , to be more creative , a trait he valued from his own early education .
Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Col@@ ored People in Princeton , where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans .
he considered racism America &apos;s &quot; worst disease , &quot; seeing it as &quot; handed down from one generation to the next . &quot; as part of his involvement , he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bo@@ is and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951 .
when Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bo@@ is , the judge decided to drop the case .
in 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania , a historically black college , where he was awarded an honorary degree .
Einstein gave a speech about racism in America , adding , &quot; I do not intend to be quiet about it . &quot; a resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student .
</p>
<p>
Einstein was a fig@@ ure@@ head leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , which opened in 1925 , and was among its first Board of Governors .
earlier , in 1921 , he was asked by the bio@@ chemist and president of the World Zionist Organization , Cha@@ im We@@ iz@@ mann , to help raise funds for the planned university .
he also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs .
among those , he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land .
that should be followed , he suggested , by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Micro@@ biology , to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria , which he called an &quot; evil &quot; that was undermining a third of the country &apos;s development .
establishing an Oriental Studies Institute , to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic , for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments , was also important .
Cha@@ im We@@ iz@@ mann later became Israel &apos;s first president .
upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ez@@ riel Car@@ le@@ bach , Prime Minister David Ben @-@ Guri@@ on offered Einstein the position of President of Israel , a mostly ceremonial post .
the offer was presented by Israel &apos;s ambassador in Washington , Ab@@ ba E@@ ban , who explained that the offer &quot; embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons . &quot; Einstein declined , and wrote in his response that he was &quot; deeply moved , &quot; and &quot; at once saddened and ashamed &quot; that he could not accept it .

Einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age , and later wrote :
&quot; if I were not a physicist , I would probably be a musician . I often think in music . I live my day@@ dreams in music . I see my life in terms of music ... I get most joy in life out of music . &quot; his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin , not only to in@@ still in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture .
according to conductor Leon Bot@@ stein , Einstein began playing when he was 5 , although he did not enjoy it at that age .
when he turned 13 , he discovered the violin son@@ atas of Mozart , whereupon &quot; Einstein fell in love &quot; with Mozart &apos;s music and studied music more willingly .
although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time , among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals , and he performed for private audiences and friends .
Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern , Z@@ ü@@ rich , and Berlin , where he played with Max Planck and his son , among others .
he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Kö@@ ch@@ el catalogue of Mozart &apos;s work ; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein , who may have been a distant relation .
in 1931 , while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology , he visited the Zo@@ ell@@ ner family conserv@@ atory in Los Angeles , where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart &apos;s works with members of the Zo@@ ell@@ ner Quartet .
near the end of his life , when the young Ju@@ illi@@ ard Quartet visited him in Princeton , he played his violin with them , and the quartet was &quot; impressed by Einstein &apos;s level of coordination and intonation . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Einstein &apos;s political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism , which he detailed in his essays such as &quot; Why Soci@@ alism ? . &quot; Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics .
he strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation @-@ states in the framework of a world federation .
the FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932 , and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,4@@ 27 pages long .
Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi .
he exchanged written letters with Gandhi , and called him &quot; a role model for the generations to come &quot; in a letter writing about him .
Einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews .
Einstein stated that he had sympathy for the impersonal pan@@ theistic God of Bar@@ uch Spin@@ oza &apos;s philosophy .
he did not believe in a personal God who concerns himself with f@@ ates and actions of human beings , a view which he described as na@@ ï@@ ve .
he clarified , however , that &quot; I am not an athe@@ ist , &quot; preferring to call himself an ag@@ nostic , or a &quot; deeply religious non@@ believer . &quot; when asked if he believed in an afterlife , Einstein replied , &quot; No . and one life is enough for me . &quot; Einstein was primarily affiliated with non @-@ religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US .
he served on the advisory board of the First Human@@ ist Society of New York , and was an honorary associate of the Ration@@ alist Association , which publishes &quot; New Human@@ ist &quot; in Britain .
for the seventy @-@ fifth anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture , he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism .
he observed , &quot; Without &apos; ethical culture &apos; there is no salvation for humanity . &quot;

on 17 April 1955 , Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm , which had previously been reinforced surg@@ ically by Rud@@ olph N@@ iss@@ en in 1948 .
he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the State of Israel &apos;s seventh anniversary with him to the hospital , but he did not live long enough to complete it .
Einstein refused surgery , saying , &quot; I want to go when I want . it is tasteless to prolong life artificially . I have done my share ; it is time to go . I will do it eleg@@ antly . &quot; he died in Princeton Hospital early the next morning at the age of 76 , having continued to work until near the end .
during the autopsy , the path@@ ologist of Princeton Hospital , Thomas Stol@@ tz Harvey , removed Einstein &apos;s brain for preservation without the permission of his family , in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent .
Einstein &apos;s remains were cre@@ mated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location .
in a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 , at UNESCO headquarters , nuclear physicist J. Robert Op@@ pen@@ heimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person :
&quot; he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without world@@ liness ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn . &quot;
</p>
<p>
throughout his life , Einstein published hundreds of books and articles .
he published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non @-@ scientific ones .
on 5 December 2014 , universities and archives announced the release of Einstein &apos;s papers , comprising more than 30,000 unique documents .
Einstein &apos;s intellectual achievements and originality have made the word &quot; Einstein &quot; synonymous with &quot; genius . &quot; in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bo@@ se @-@ Einstein statistics , the Einstein refrigerator and others .

the &quot; Ann@@ us Mira@@ bil@@ is &quot; papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect , Brow@@ nian motion , the special theory of relativity , and E = mc@@ 2 that Einstein published in the &quot; Ann@@ al@@ en der Physi@@ k &quot; scientific journal in 1905 .
these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space , time , and matter .
</p>
<p>
Einstein &apos;s first paper submitted in 1900 to &quot; Ann@@ al@@ en der Physi@@ k &quot; was on capillary attraction .
it was published in 1901 with the title &quot; Fol@@ ger@@ un@@ gen aus den Cap@@ ill@@ ar@@ it@@ ä@@ t@@ ser@@ sch@@ e@@ inun@@ gen , &quot; which translates as &quot; Conclusions from the cap@@ ill@@ arity phenomena . &quot; two papers he published in 19@@ 02 @-@ 1903 attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view .
these papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brow@@ nian motion , which showed that Brow@@ nian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist .
his research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena .
</p>
<p>
Einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations , giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point .
ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density .
at the critical point , this derivative is zero , leading to large fluctuations .
the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered , making the fluid look milky white .
Einstein relates this to Ray@@ le@@ igh scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength , and which explains why the sky is blue .
Einstein quantitatively derived critical op@@ al@@ escence from a treatment of density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and Ray@@ le@@ igh scattering originate from the atom@@ istic constitution of matter .

Einstein &apos;s &quot; &quot; Z@@ ur Ele@@ k@@ tro@@ dynam@@ ik be@@ weg@@ ter K@@ ör@@ per &quot; &quot; was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year .
it reconciled conflicts between Maxwell &apos;s equations and the laws of New@@ tonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics .
observ@@ ationally , the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds .
the theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein &apos;s special theory of relativity .
this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer , a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down , and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion .
this paper also argued that the idea of a lum@@ ini@@ ferous a@@ ether - one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time - was superfluous .
in his paper on mass @-@ energy equivalence , Einstein produced &quot; E &quot; = &quot; m@@ c &quot; 2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations .
Einstein &apos;s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was accepted by leading physicists , starting with Max Planck .
Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics .
in 1908 , Her@@ mann Min@@ k@@ owski re@@ interpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of space@@ time .
Einstein adopted Min@@ k@@ owski &apos;s form@@ alism in his 1915 general theory of relativity .

General relativity is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915 .
according to general relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the war@@ ping of space and time by those masses .
General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics .
it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes , regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape .
as Einstein later said , the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory , while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion should appear more satisfactory .
consequently , in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity .
in that article titled &quot; On the Rel@@ ativity Principle and the Conclusions Dra@@ wn from It , &quot; he argued that free fall is really inertial motion , and that for a free @-@ falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply .
this argument is called the equivalence principle .
in the same article , Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dil@@ ation , gravitational red shift and deflection of light .
in 1911 , Einstein published another article &quot; On the Influence of Gra@@ v@@ itation on the Prop@@ ag@@ ation of Light &quot; expanding on the 1907 article , in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies .
thus , the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally .
</p>
<p>
in 1916 , Einstein predicted gravitational waves , ripples in the curvature of space@@ time which propagate as waves , traveling outward from the source , transporting energy as gravitational radiation .
the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lor@@ ent@@ z invari@@ ance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it .
by contrast , gravitational waves cannot exist in the New@@ tonian theory of gravitation , which post@@ ulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed .
the first , indirect , detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars , P@@ SR B@@ 19@@ 13 + 16 .
the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves .
Einstein &apos;s prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016 , when researchers at LI@@ GO published the first observation of gravitational waves , detected on Earth on 14 September 2015 , exactly one hundred years after the prediction .
</p>
<p>
while developing general relativity , Einstein became confused about the gauge invari@@ ance in the theory .
he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relati@@ vis@@ tic field theory is impossible .
he gave up looking for fully generally co@@ variant ten@@ sor equations , and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only .
in June 19@@ 13 , the En@@ tw@@ ur@@ f theory was the result of these investigations .
as its name suggests , it was a sketch of a theory , less elegant and more difficult than general relativity , with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions .
after more than two years of intensive work , Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915 .
</p>
<p>
in 1917 , Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole .
he discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic , either contracting or expanding .
as observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time , Einstein introduced a new term , the cosm@@ ological constant , to the field equations , in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe .
the modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature , in accordance with Einstein &apos;s understanding of M@@ ach &apos;s principle in these years .
this model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein &apos;s static universe .
following the discovery of the recession of the nebul@@ ae by Edwin Hubble in 1929 , Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe , and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos , The Fried@@ mann @-@ Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein @-@ de Sit@@ ter universe of 1932 .
in each of these models , Einstein discarded the cosm@@ ological constant , claiming that it was &quot; in any case theoretically unsatisfactory . &quot; in many Einstein bi@@ ographies , it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosm@@ ological constant in later years as his &quot; biggest blunder . &quot; the astro@@ physicist Mario Li@@ vio has recently cast doubt on this claim , suggesting that it may be exaggerated .
in late 2013 , a team led by the Irish physicist Cor@@ mac O &apos;@@ Ra@@ if@@ ear@@ ta@@ igh discovered evidence that , shortly after learning of Hubble &apos;s observations of the recession of the nebul@@ ae , Einstein considered a steady @-@ state model of the universe .
in a hitherto overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter , a process he associated with the cosm@@ ological constant .
as he stated in the paper , &quot; In what follows , I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation that can account for Hub@@ bel &apos;s &#91; &quot; sic &quot; &#93; facts , and in which the density is constant over time &quot; ...
&quot; if one considers a physically bounded volume , particles of matter will be continually leaving it . for the density to remain constant , new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space . &quot; it thus appears that Einstein considered a steady @-@ state model of the expanding universe many years before Ho@@ yle , Bon@@ di and Gold .
however , Einstein &apos;s steady @-@ state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea .
</p>

General relativity includes a dynamical space@@ time , so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum .
No@@ ether &apos;s theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lag@@ ran@@ gian with translation invari@@ ance , but general co@@ variance makes translation invari@@ ance into something of a gauge symmetry .
the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by No@@ ether &apos;s prescriptions do not make a real ten@@ sor for this reason .
Einstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons , because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates .
he maintained that the non @-@ co@@ variant energy momentum pseud@@ ot@@ ensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field .
this approach has been echoed by L@@ ev Land@@ au and Ev@@ geny Lif@@ sh@@ itz , and others , and has become standard .
the use of non @-@ co@@ variant objects like pseud@@ ot@@ ens@@ ors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Er@@ win Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger and others .
</p>
<p>
in 1935 , Einstein collaborated with Nathan Ro@@ sen to produce a model of a worm@@ hole , often called Einstein @-@ Ro@@ sen bridges .
his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations , in line with the program outlined in the paper &quot; Do Gra@@ vit@@ ational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Par@@ ticles ? . &quot; these solutions cut and pasted Schwar@@ z@@ s@@ child black holes to make a bridge between two patches .
if one end of a worm@@ hole was positively charged , the other end would be negatively charged .
these properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and anti@@ particles could be described in this way .
</p>
<p>
in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity , the aff@@ ine connection needed to be generalized to include an anti@@ symmetric part , called the torsion .
this modification was made by Einstein and Car@@ tan in the 1920s .
</p>
<p>
the theory of general relativity has a fundamental law - the Einstein equations which describe how space curves , the geo@@ des@@ ic equation which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations .
since the equations of general relativity are non @-@ linear , a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields , like a black hole , would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves , not by a new law .
so Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution , like a black hole , would be determined to be a geo@@ des@@ ic from general relativity itself .
this was established by Einstein , Inf@@ eld , and Hoffmann for point@@ like objects without angular momentum , and by Roy K@@ err for spinning objects .
</p>
<p>
in a 1905 paper , Einstein post@@ ulated that light itself consists of localized particles .
Einstein &apos;s light qu@@ anta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists , including Max Planck and Ni@@ els Bo@@ hr .
this idea only became universally accepted in 1919 , with Robert Mil@@ lik@@ an &apos;s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect , and with the measurement of Comp@@ ton scattering .
Einstein concluded that each wave of frequency &quot; f &quot; is associated with a collection of photons with energy &quot; h@@ f &quot; each , where &quot; h &quot; is Planck &apos;s constant .
he does not say much more , because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave .
but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the photoelectric effect .
</p>
<p>
in 1907 , Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator .
in the Einstein model , each atom oscill@@ ates independently - a series of equally spaced quanti@@ zed states for each oscillator .
Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscill@@ ations would be difficult , but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics .
Peter De@@ bye refined this model .
</p>
<p>
throughout the 19@@ 10@@ s , quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems .
after Ernest Ru@@ ther@@ ford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets , Ni@@ els Bo@@ hr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical post@@ ulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms , and the periodic table of the elements .
Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wi@@ en had made .
Wi@@ en had shown that the hypothesis of adi@@ ab@@ atic invari@@ ance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the black@@ body curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process .
Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adi@@ ab@@ atic principle shows that the quantity which is quanti@@ zed in any mechanical motion must be an adi@@ ab@@ atic invariant .
Arnold Som@@ mer@@ feld identified this adi@@ ab@@ atic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics .
</p>
<p>
in 1924 , Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Sat@@ y@@ endra N@@ ath Bo@@ se , based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles .
Einstein noted that Bo@@ se &apos;s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles , and submitted his translation of Bo@@ se &apos;s paper to the &quot; Ze@@ it@@ sch@@ rift für Physi@@ k &quot; .
Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications , among them the Bo@@ se @-@ Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures .
it was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Al@@ lin Cornell and Carl Wi@@ eman using ultra @-@ cooling equipment built at the N@@ IST @-@ J@@ ILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boul@@ der .
Bo@@ se @-@ Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bo@@ sons .
Einstein &apos;s sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Le@@ iden University .
</p>
<p>
although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Exam@@ iner Second Class in 1906 , he had not given up on academia .
in 1908 , he became a &quot; Priv@@ at@@ do@@ z@@ ent &quot; at the University of Bern .
in &quot; &quot; Ü@@ ber die En@@ tw@@ ick@@ lung un@@ ser@@ er An@@ scha@@ u@@ un@@ gen ü@@ ber das Wes@@ en und die Kon@@ stitution der Stra@@ h@@ lung &quot; &quot; , on the quanti@@ zation of light , and in an earlier 19@@ 09 paper , Einstein showed that Max Planck &apos;s energy qu@@ anta must have well @-@ defined moment@@ a and act in some respects as independent , point @-@ like particles .
this paper introduced the &quot; photon &quot; concept and inspired the notion of wave @-@ particle duality in quantum mechanics .
Einstein saw this wave @-@ particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new , unified foundation .
</p>
<p>
in a series of works completed from 1911 to 19@@ 13 , Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero @-@ point energy in his &quot; second quantum theory . &quot; soon , this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern .
assuming the energy of rotating di@@ atomic molecules contains zero @-@ point energy , they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data .
the numbers matched nicely .
however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero @-@ point energy .
</p>
<p>
in 1917 , at the height of his work on relativity , Einstein published an article in &quot; Physi@@ kal@@ ische Ze@@ it@@ sch@@ rift &quot; that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission , the physical process that makes possible the m@@ aser and the laser .
this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck &apos;s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode .
this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics , because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws .
</p>
<p>
Einstein discovered Louis de Bro@@ g@@ lie &apos;s work and supported his ideas , which were received skep@@ tically at first .
this paper would inspire Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger &apos;s work of 1926 .
</p>
<p>
Einstein was displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925 .
contrary to popular belief , his doubts were not due to a conviction that God &quot; is not playing at dice . &quot; indeed , it was Einstein himself , in his 1917 paper that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission , who first proposed the fundamental role of chance in explaining quantum processes .
rather , he objected to what quantum mechanics implies about the nature of reality .
Einstein believed that a physical reality exists independent of our ability to observe it .
in contrast , Bo@@ hr and his followers maintained that all we can know are the results of measurements and observations , and that it makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions .
</p>
<p>
the Bo@@ hr @-@ Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Ni@@ els Bo@@ hr , who were two of its founders .
their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science .
their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics .
</p>
<p>
in 1935 , Einstein returned quantum mechanics , in particular to the question of its completeness , in the &quot; EPR paper . &quot; in a thought experiment , he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated .
no matter how far the two particles were separated , a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle ; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle , without needing to disturb the other particle in any way .
given Einstein &apos;s concept of local realism , there were two possibilities : either the other particle had these properties already determined , or the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle .
Einstein rejected this second possibility .
Einstein &apos;s belief in local realism led him to assert that , while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question , it must be incomplete .
but as a physical principle , local realism was shown to be incorrect when the Aspec@@ t experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell &apos;s theorem , which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964 .
the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which &quot; particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical @-@ like entities , each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated . &quot; although Einstein was wrong about local realism , his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite , &quot; entangled quantum states &quot; , has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in Physical Review .
it is considered a center@@ piece of the development of quantum information theory .
</p>
<p>
following his research on general relativity , Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromag@@ ne@@ tism as another aspect of a single entity .
in 1950 , he described his &quot; unified field theory &quot; in a &quot; Scientific American &quot; article titled &quot; On the Generalized Theory of Gra@@ v@@ itation . &quot; although he continued to be lauded for his work , Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research , and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful .
in his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces , Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics , most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces , which were not well understood until many years after his death .
mainstream physics , in turn , largely ignored Einstein &apos;s approaches to unification .
Einstein &apos;s dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory , where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum @-@ mechanical setting .
</p>
<p>
Einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned .
these pertain to force , super@@ conductivity , and other research .
</p>
<p>
in addition to longtime collaborators Le@@ opo@@ ld Inf@@ eld , Nathan Ro@@ sen , Peter Berg@@ mann and others , Einstein also had some one @-@ shot collaborations with various scientists .
</p>
<p>
Einstein and De Ha@@ as demonstrated that magne@@ tization is due to the motion of electrons , nowadays known to be the spin .
in order to show this , they reversed the magne@@ tization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum .
they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate , because the electron &apos;s angular momentum changes as the magne@@ tization changes .
this experiment needed to be sensitive , because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small , but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magne@@ tization .
</p>
<p>
Einstein suggested to Er@@ win Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bo@@ se @-@ Einstein gas by considering a box .
then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator .
quanti@@ zing these oscill@@ ators , each level will have an integer occupation number , which will be the number of particles in it .
this formulation is a form of second quanti@@ zation , but it pre@@ dates modern quantum mechanics .
Er@@ win Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semic@@ l@@ ass@@ ical ideal gas .
Sch@@ r@@ ö@@ d@@ inger urged Einstein to add his name as co @-@ author , although Einstein declined the invitation .
</p>
<p>
in 1926 , Einstein and his former student Le@@ ó Sz@@ il@@ á@@ rd co @-@ invented the Einstein refrigerator .
this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input .
on 11 November 1930 , was awarded to Einstein and Le@@ ó Sz@@ il@@ á@@ rd for the refrigerator .
their invention was not immediately put into commercial production , and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electro@@ lu@@ x .
</p>
<p>
while traveling , Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted step@@ daughters Mar@@ got and Il@@ se .
the letters were included in the papers beque@@ athed to The Hebrew University .
Mar@@ got Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public , but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death .
Einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the Plum@@ bers and Ste@@ am@@ fit@@ ters Union .
Barbara Wol@@ ff , of The Hebrew University &apos;s Albert Einstein Archives , told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 .
Cor@@ bis , successor to The Roger Rich@@ man Agency , licenses the use of his name and associated imagery , as agent for the university .
</p>
<p>
in the period before World War II , &quot; The New Yor@@ ker &quot; published a vig@@ nette in their &quot; The Talk of the Town &quot; feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain &quot; that theory . &quot; he finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries .
he told his inqu@@ ir@@ ers &quot; Par@@ don me , sorry ! always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein . &quot; Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels , films , plays , and works of music .
he is a favorite model for depic@@ tions of mad scientists and absent @-@ minded professors ; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated . &quot;
time &quot; magazine &apos;s Freder@@ ic Golden wrote that Einstein was &quot; a carto@@ onist &apos;s dream come true . &quot; many popular quotations are often mis@@ attributed to him .
</p>
<p>
Einstein received numerous awards and honors and in 1922 he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot; for his services to Theoretical Physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect . &quot; none of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel , so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922 .

<p>
Alexander III of Mac@@ ed@@ on , commonly known as Alexander the Great , was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Mac@@ ed@@ on and a member of the Ar@@ ge@@ ad dynasty .
he was born in P@@ ella in 356 BC and succeeded his father Philip II to the throne at the age of 20 .
he spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa , and he created one of the largest empires of the ancient world by the age of thirty , stretching from Greece to northwestern India .
he was un@@ defeated in battle and is widely considered one of history &apos;s most successful military commanders .
during his youth , Alexander was tutor@@ ed by Aristotle until age 16 .
after Philip &apos;s assassination in 336 BC , he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army .
Alexander was awarded the gener@@ al@@ ship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father &apos;s pan @-@ Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia .
in 334 BC , he invaded the Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years .
following the conquest of Anatol@@ ia , Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles , most notably the battles of Is@@ sus and Gau@@ gam@@ ela .
he subsequently overthrew Persian King D@@ arius III and conquered the Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id Empire in its entirety .
at that point , his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indu@@ s River .
he endeav@@ ored to reach the &quot; ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea &quot; and invaded India in 326 BC , winning an important victory over the P@@ au@@ rav@@ as at the Battle of the Hy@@ das@@ pes .
he eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops .
Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC , the city that he planned to establish as his capital , without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia .
in the years following his death , a series of civil wars tore his empire apart , resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the Di@@ ad@@ o@@ chi , Alexander &apos;s surviving generals and heirs .
Alexander &apos;s legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syn@@ cre@@ tism which his conqu@@ ests engendered , such as G@@ rec@@ o @-@ Buddhism .
he founded some twenty cities that bore his name , most notably Alexandria in Egypt .
Alexander &apos;s settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hell@@ en@@ istic civilization , aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid @-@ 15th century AD and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatol@@ ia until the 1920s .
Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles , and he features prominently in the history and my@@ thic traditions of both Greek and non @-@ Greek cultures .
he became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves , and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics .
he is often ranked among the most influential people in history .
</p>
<p>
Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of He@@ k@@ atom@@ ba@@ ion , which probably corresponds to 20@@ July 356 BC , although the exact date is disputed , in P@@ ella , the capital of the Kingdom of Mac@@ ed@@ on .
he was the son of the king of Mac@@ ed@@ on , Philip II , and his fourth wife , Olymp@@ ias , the daughter of Ne@@ op@@ tol@@ em@@ us I , king of E@@ pir@@ us .
although Philip had seven or eight wives , Olymp@@ ias was his principal wife for some time , likely because she gave birth to Alexander .
several legends surround Alexander &apos;s birth and childhood .
according to the ancient Greek bi@@ ographer Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch , on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip , Olymp@@ ias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt that caused a flame to spread &quot; far and wide &quot; before dying away .
sometime after the wedding , Philip is said to have seen himself , in a dream , securing his wife &apos;s womb with a seal engraved with a lion &apos;s image .
Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams : that Olymp@@ ias was pregnant before her marriage , indicated by the sealing of her womb ; or that Alexander &apos;s father was Zeus .
ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olymp@@ ias promulgated the story of Alexander &apos;s divine parentage , variously claiming that she had told Alexander , or that she dismissed the suggestion as imp@@ ious .
on the day Alexander was born , Philip was preparing a siege on the city of P@@ oti@@ dea on the peninsula of Chal@@ ci@@ dice .
that same day , Philip received news that his general Par@@ men@@ ion had defeated the combined Il@@ ly@@ rian and Pa@@ e@@ onian armies , and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games .
it was also said that on this day , the Temple of Artem@@ is in Ep@@ he@@ sus , one of the Seven Won@@ ders of the World , burnt down .
this led Heg@@ e@@ sias of Mag@@ nesia to say that it had burnt down because Artem@@ is was away , attending the birth of Alexander .
such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king , and possibly at his own instigation , to show that he was super@@ human and destined for greatness from conception .
in his early years , Alexander was raised by a nurse , Lan@@ ike , sister of Alexander &apos;s future general Cle@@ itus the Black .
later in his childhood , Alexander was tutor@@ ed by the strict Leon@@ id@@ as , a relative of his mother , and by Ly@@ sim@@ ach@@ us of Ac@@ ar@@ n@@ ania .
Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths , learning to read , play the ly@@ re , ride , fight , and hunt .
when Alexander was ten years old , a trader from Thess@@ aly brought Philip a horse , which he offered to sell for thirteen talents .
the horse refused to be mounted , and Philip ordered it away .
Alexander however , detecting the horse &apos;s fear of its own shadow , asked to tame the horse , which he eventually managed .
Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch stated that Philip , overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition , kissed his son tear@@ fully , declaring :
&quot; my boy , you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions . Mac@@ ed@@ on is too small for you , &quot; and bought the horse for him .
Alexander named it Bu@@ cephal@@ as , meaning &quot; ox @-@ head . &quot; Bu@@ cephal@@ as carried Alexander as far as India .
when the animal died , Alexander named a city after him , Bu@@ cephal@@ a .
</p>
<p>
when Alexander was 13 , Philip began to search for a tutor , and considered such academics as Is@@ oc@@ rates and Spe@@ u@@ sip@@ pus , the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the Academy to take up the post .
in the end , Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the N@@ ym@@ phs at Mi@@ e@@ za as a classroom .
in return for teaching Alexander , Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle &apos;s hometown of St@@ age@@ ira , which Philip had razed , and to re@@ populate it by buying and freeing the ex @-@ citizens who were slaves , or par@@ doning those who were in exile .
Mi@@ e@@ za was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles , such as P@@ tol@@ emy , Hep@@ ha@@ is@@ tion , and Cass@@ ander .
many of these students would become his friends and future generals , and are often known as the &apos; Compan@@ ions &apos; .
Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine , philosophy , morals , religion , logic , and art .
under Aristotle &apos;s tutel@@ age , Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer , and in particular the &quot; Ili@@ ad &quot; ;
Aristotle gave him an annotated copy , which Alexander later carried on his campaigns .
during his youth , Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court , who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes III .
among them were Ar@@ ta@@ baz@@ os II and his daughter Bar@@ sine , future mistress of Alexander , who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC , as well as Am@@ min@@ apes , future sat@@ rap of Alexander , or a Persian nobl@@ eman named Sis@@ ines .
this gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues , and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state .
</p>
<p>
at age 16 , Alexander &apos;s education under Aristotle ended .
Philip waged war against Byz@@ an@@ tion , leaving Alexander in charge as reg@@ ent and heir apparent .
during Philip &apos;s absence , the Th@@ rac@@ ian Ma@@ e@@ di revol@@ ted against Macedonia .
Alexander responded quickly , driving them from their territory .
he colonized it with Greeks , and founded a city named Alexand@@ ro@@ polis .
upon Philip &apos;s return , he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revol@@ ts in southern Thrace .
campaigning against the Greek city of Per@@ in@@ thus , Alexander is reported to have saved his father &apos;s life .
meanwhile , the city of Am@@ ph@@ issa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi , a sac@@ r@@ ileg@@ e that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs .
still occupied in Thrace , he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece .
concerned that other Greek states might intervene , Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Il@@ ly@@ ria instead .
during this turmoil , the Il@@ ly@@ rians invaded Macedonia , only to be repelled by Alexander .
Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC , and they marched south through Ther@@ m@@ op@@ y@@ la@@ e , taking it after stubborn resistance from its The@@ ban garrison .
they went on to occupy the city of E@@ lat@@ ea , only a few days &apos; march from both Athens and The@@ bes .
the Ath@@ en@@ ians , led by Dem@@ os@@ then@@ es , voted to seek alliance with The@@ bes against Macedonia .
both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win The@@ bes &apos; favour , but Athens won the contest .
Philip marched on Am@@ ph@@ issa , capturing the mercenaries sent there by Dem@@ os@@ then@@ es and accepting the city &apos;s surrender .
Philip then returned to E@@ lat@@ ea , sending a final offer of peace to Athens and The@@ bes , who both rejected it .
as Philip marched south , his opponents blocked him near Cha@@ er@@ on@@ ea , Bo@@ e@@ oti@@ a .
during the ensuing Battle of Cha@@ er@@ on@@ ea , Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left , accompanied by a group of Philip &apos;s trusted generals .
according to the ancient sources , the two sides fought bitterly for some time .
Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat , counting on the un@@ tested Ath@@ en@@ ian ho@@ pl@@ ites to follow , thus breaking their line .
Alexander was the first to break the The@@ ban lines , followed by Philip &apos;s generals .
having damaged the enemy &apos;s cohesion , Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them .
with the Ath@@ en@@ ians lost , the The@@ bans were surrounded .
left to fight alone , they were defeated .
after the victory at Cha@@ er@@ on@@ ea , Philip and Alexander marched un@@ opposed into the Pel@@ op@@ onn@@ ese , welcomed by all cities ; however , when they reached Spart@@ a , they were refused , but did not resort to war .
at Corin@@ th , Philip established a &quot; Hellenic Alliance &quot; , which included most Greek city @-@ states except Spart@@ a .
Philip was then named &quot; Heg@@ em@@ on &quot; of this league , and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire .
</p>
<p>
when Philip returned to P@@ ella , he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eur@@ y@@ dice in 338 BC , the niece of his general At@@ tal@@ us .
the marriage made Alexander &apos;s position as heir less secure , since any son of Cleopatra Eur@@ y@@ dice would be a fully Macedonian heir , while Alexander was only half @-@ Macedonian .
during the wedding banquet , a drunken At@@ tal@@ us publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir .
at the wedding of Cleopatra , whom Philip fell in love with and married , she being much too young for him , her uncle At@@ tal@@ us in his drink desired the Mac@@ ed@@ onians would impl@@ ore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece .
this so irritated Alexander , that throwing one of the cups at his head , &quot; You villain , &quot; said he , &quot; what , am I then a bastard ? &quot; then Philip , taking At@@ tal@@ us &apos;s part , rose up and would have run his son through ; but by good fortune for them both , either his over @-@ hasty rage , or the wine he had drunk , made his foot slip , so that he fell down on the floor .
at which Alexander repro@@ ach@@ fully insulted over him : &quot; see there , &quot; said he , &quot; the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia , overturned in passing from one seat to another . &quot; Alexander fled Mac@@ ed@@ on with his mother , dropping her off with her brother , King Alexander I of E@@ pir@@ us in Do@@ don@@ a , capital of the Mol@@ os@@ sians .
he continued to Il@@ ly@@ ria , where he sought refuge with the Il@@ ly@@ rian king and was treated as a guest , despite having defeated them in battle a few years before .
however , it appears Philip never intended to dis@@ own his politically and militarily trained son .
accordingly , Alexander returned to Mac@@ ed@@ on after six months due to the efforts of a family friend , Demar@@ atus , who mediated between the two parties .
in the following year , the Persian sat@@ rap of C@@ aria , Pi@@ x@@ o@@ dar@@ us , offered his eldest daughter to Alexander &apos;s half @-@ brother , Philip Ar@@ r@@ hid@@ a@@ eus .
Olymp@@ ias and several of Alexander &apos;s friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Ar@@ r@@ hid@@ a@@ eus his heir .
Alexander reacted by sending an actor , Thess@@ al@@ us of Corin@@ th , to tell Pi@@ x@@ o@@ dar@@ us that he should not offer his daughter &apos;s hand to an illegitimate son , but instead to Alexander .
when Philip heard of this , he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a C@@ arian , explaining that he wanted a better bride for him .
Philip exiled four of Alexander &apos;s friends , Har@@ pal@@ us , N@@ ear@@ ch@@ us , P@@ tol@@ emy and Eri@@ gy@@ ius , and had the Corin@@ thians bring Thess@@ al@@ us to him in chains .
</p>
<p>
in summer 336 BC , while at Aeg@@ ae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olymp@@ ias &apos;s brother , Alexander I of E@@ pir@@ us , Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards , P@@ aus@@ ani@@ as .
as P@@ aus@@ ani@@ as tried to escape , he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursu@@ ers , including two of Alexander &apos;s companions , Per@@ dic@@ cas and Leon@@ nat@@ us .
Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20 .
</p>
<p>
Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne .
he had his cousin , the former A@@ my@@ n@@ tas IV , executed .
he also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyn@@ c@@ esti@@ s killed , but spared a third , Alexander Lyn@@ c@@ est@@ es .
Olymp@@ ias had Cleopatra Eur@@ y@@ dice and Europa , her daughter by Philip , burned alive .
when Alexander learned about this , he was furious .
Alexander also ordered the murder of At@@ tal@@ us , who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra &apos;s uncle .
At@@ tal@@ us was at that time corresponding with Dem@@ os@@ then@@ es , regarding the possibility of defec@@ ting to Athens .
At@@ tal@@ us also had severely insulted Alexander , and following Cleopatra &apos;s murder , Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive .
Alexander spared Ar@@ r@@ hid@@ a@@ eus , who was by all accounts mentally disabled , possibly as a result of poisoning by Olymp@@ ias .
news of Philip &apos;s death roused many states into revolt , including The@@ bes , Athens , Thess@@ aly , and the Th@@ rac@@ ian tribes north of Mac@@ ed@@ on .
when news of the revol@@ ts reached Alexander , he responded quickly .
though advised to use diplomacy , Alexander must@@ ered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thess@@ aly .
he found the Thess@@ alian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount O@@ ssa , and ordered his men to ride over Mount O@@ ssa .
when the Thess@@ alians awoke the next day , they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered , adding their cavalry to Alexander &apos;s force .
he then continued south towards the Pel@@ op@@ onn@@ ese .
Alexander stopped at Ther@@ m@@ op@@ y@@ la@@ e , where he was recognized as the leader of the Am@@ ph@@ ic@@ ty@@ onic League before heading south to Corin@@ th .
Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels .
the famous encounter between Alexander and Di@@ o@@ genes the Cy@@ nic occurred during Alexander &apos;s stay in Corin@@ th .
when Alexander asked Di@@ o@@ genes what he could do for him , the philosopher disd@@ ain@@ fully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side , as he was blocking the sunlight .
this reply apparently delighted Alexander , who is reported to have said &quot; But verily , if I were not Alexander , I would like to be Di@@ o@@ genes . &quot; at Corin@@ th , Alexander took the title of &quot; Heg@@ em@@ on &quot; and , like Philip , was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia .
he also received news of a Th@@ rac@@ ian uprising .
</p>
<p>
before crossing to Asia , Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders .
in the spring of 335 BC , he advanced to suppress several revol@@ ts .
starting from Amp@@ hi@@ polis , he travelled east into the country of the &quot; Independent Th@@ rac@@ ians &quot; ; and at Mount Ha@@ em@@ us , the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Th@@ rac@@ ian forces manning the heights .
the Mac@@ ed@@ onians marched into the country of the Tri@@ bal@@ li , and defeated their army near the Ly@@ gin@@ us river .
Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube , encountering the Ge@@ ta@@ e tribe on the opposite shore .
crossing the river at night , he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirm@@ ish .
news then reached Alexander that Cle@@ itus , King of Il@@ ly@@ ria , and King G@@ lau@@ ki@@ as of the Ta@@ ul@@ anti@@ i were in open revolt against his authority .
marching west into Il@@ ly@@ ria , Alexander defeated each in turn , forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops .
with these victories , he secured his northern frontier .
while Alexander campaigned north , the The@@ bans and Ath@@ en@@ ians rebelled once again .
Alexander immediately headed south .
while the other cities again hesitated , The@@ bes decided to fight .
the The@@ ban resistance was ineffective , and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Bo@@ e@@ oti@@ an cities .
the end of The@@ bes co@@ wed Athens , leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace .
Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign , leaving Anti@@ p@@ ater as reg@@ ent .
</p>
<p>
in 336 BC Philip II had already sent Par@@ men@@ ion , with A@@ my@@ n@@ tas , And@@ rom@@ enes and At@@ tal@@ us , and an army of 10,000 men into Anatol@@ ia to make preparations for an invasion to free the Greeks living on the western coast and islands from Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id rule .
at first , all went well .
the Greek cities on the western coast of Anatol@@ ia revol@@ ted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander .
the Mac@@ ed@@ onians were demor@@ alized by Philip &apos;s death and were subsequently defeated near Mag@@ nesia by the Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ ids under the command of the mercenary Mem@@ non of Rhodes .
taking over the invasion project of Philip II , Alexander &apos;s army crossed the Hell@@ es@@ pon@@ t in 334 BC with approximately 4@@ 8,100 soldiers , 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000 , drawn from Mac@@ ed@@ on and various Greek city @-@ states , mercenaries , and feud@@ ally raised soldiers from Thrace , Pai@@ onia , and Il@@ ly@@ ria .
he showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods .
this also showed Alexander &apos;s eagerness to fight , in contrast to his father &apos;s preference for diplomacy .
after an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Gran@@ icus , Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of S@@ ard@@ is ; he then proceeded along the I@@ onian coast , granting autonomy and democracy to the cities .
Mil@@ etus , held by Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id forces , required a delicate siege operation , with Persian naval forces nearby .
further south , at Hal@@ ic@@ ar@@ nas@@ sus , in C@@ aria , Alexander successfully waged his first large @-@ scale siege , eventually forcing his opponents , the mercenary captain Mem@@ non of Rhodes and the Persian sat@@ rap of C@@ aria , O@@ ron@@ tob@@ ates , to withdraw by sea .
Alexander left the government of C@@ aria to a member of the H@@ ec@@ atom@@ n@@ id dynasty , Ad@@ a , who adopted Alexander .
from Hal@@ ic@@ ar@@ nas@@ sus , Alexander proceeded into mountainous Ly@@ cia and the Pam@@ phy@@ lian plain , asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Per@@ sians naval bases .
from Pam@@ phy@@ lia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland .
at Ter@@ mess@@ os , Alexander humbled but did not storm the Pi@@ si@@ dian city .
at the ancient Ph@@ ry@@ gian capital of Gor@@ dium , Alexander &quot; un@@ did &quot; the hitherto un@@ sol@@ vable Gor@@ dian K@@ not , a feat said to await the future &quot; king of Asia . &quot; according to the story , Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword .
</p>
<p>
in spring 333 BC , Alexander crossed the Taurus into C@@ il@@ ic@@ ia .
after a long pause due to an illness , he marched on towards Syria .
though out@@ man@@ oeu@@ vered by D@@ arius &apos; significantly larger army , he marched back to C@@ il@@ ic@@ ia , where he defeated D@@ arius at Is@@ sus .
D@@ arius fled the battle , causing his army to collapse , and left behind his wife , his two daughters , his mother Sis@@ yg@@ amb@@ is , and a fabulous treasure .
he offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost , and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family .
Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia , it was he alone who decided territorial divisions .
Alexander proceeded to take possession of Syria , and most of the coast of the Lev@@ ant .
in the following year , 332 BC , he was forced to attack Tyre , which he captured after a long and difficult siege .
the men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery .
</p>
<p>
when Alexander destroyed Tyre , most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capit@@ ulated .
however , Alexander met with resistance at Gaza .
the stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill , requiring a siege .
when &quot; his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible ... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt . &quot; after three unsuccessful assaults , the stronghold fell , but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound .
as in Tyre , men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery .
Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC , where he was regarded as a liber@@ ator .
he was pronounced son of the deity A@@ mun at the Oracle of Si@@ wa O@@ asis in the Libyan desert .
henceforth , Alexander often referred to Zeus @-@ Ammon as his true father , and after his death , currency depicted him adorned with the horns of a ram as a symbol of his divinity .
during his stay in Egypt , he founded Alexandria @-@ by @-@ Egypt , which would become the prosperous capital of the P@@ tol@@ em@@ a@@ ic Kingdom after his death .
</p>
<p>
leaving Egypt in 331 BC , Alexander marched eastward into Mesopotam@@ ia and again defeated D@@ arius , at the Battle of Gau@@ gam@@ ela .
D@@ arius once more fled the field , and Alexander chased him as far as Ar@@ bel@@ a .
Gau@@ gam@@ ela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two .
D@@ arius fled over the mountains to Ec@@ bat@@ ana , while Alexander captured Babylon .
</p>
<p>
from Babylon , Alexander went to Sus@@ a , one of the Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id capitals , and captured its treasury .
he sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Per@@ se@@ polis via the Persian Royal Road .
Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city .
he then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ari@@ ob@@ ar@@ z@@ anes and then hurried to Per@@ se@@ polis before its garrison could loot the treasury .
on entering Per@@ se@@ polis , Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days .
Alexander stayed in Per@@ se@@ polis for five months .
during his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of X@@ er@@ xes I and spread to the rest of the city .
possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Ac@@ ro@@ polis of Athens during the Second Persian War by X@@ er@@ xes .
even as he watched the city burn , Alexander immediately began to regret his decision .
Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires , but that the flames had already spread to most of the city .
Cur@@ tius claims that Alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning .
Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch re@@ counts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of X@@ er@@ xes as if it were a live person :
shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece , or shall I set you up again because of your magnanim@@ ity and your virtues in other respects ?
</p>
<p>
Alexander then chased D@@ arius , first into Media , and then Par@@ thia .
the Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny , and was taken prisoner by Bes@@ sus , his Bac@@ tri@@ an sat@@ rap and kin@@ sman .
as Alexander approached , Bes@@ sus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself D@@ arius &apos; successor as Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes V , before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander .
Alexander buried D@@ arius &apos; remains next to his Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id predecessors in a reg@@ al funeral .
he claimed that , while dying , D@@ arius had named him as his successor to the Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id throne .
the Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id Empire is normally considered to have fallen with D@@ arius .
Alexander viewed Bes@@ sus as a usur@@ per and set out to defeat him .
this campaign , initially against Bes@@ sus , turned into a grand tour of central Asia .
Alexander founded a series of new cities , all called Alexandria , including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan , and Alexandria E@@ sch@@ ate in modern Tajikistan .
the campaign took Alexander through Media , Par@@ thia , Ari@@ a , D@@ ran@@ gi@@ ana , Ar@@ acho@@ sia , Bac@@ tri@@ a , and Scy@@ thia .
Sp@@ it@@ amen@@ es , who held an undefined position in the sat@@ rap@@ y of S@@ og@@ di@@ ana , in 329 BC betrayed Bes@@ sus to P@@ tol@@ emy , one of Alexander &apos;s trusted companions , and Bes@@ sus was executed .
however , when , at some point later , Alexander was on the J@@ ax@@ ar@@ tes dealing with an incursion by a horse nom@@ ad army , Sp@@ it@@ amen@@ es raised S@@ og@@ di@@ ana in revolt .
Alexander personally defeated the Scy@@ thians at the Battle of J@@ ax@@ ar@@ tes and immediately launched a campaign against Sp@@ it@@ amen@@ es , defeating him in the Battle of Gab@@ ai .
after the defeat , Sp@@ it@@ amen@@ es was killed by his own men , who then sued for peace .
</p>
<p>
during this time , Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court , notably the custom of &quot; pro@@ sky@@ ne@@ sis &quot; , either a symbolic kissing of the hand , or pro@@ stration on the ground , that Per@@ sians showed to their social superiors .
the Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of de@@ ities and believed that Alexander meant to de@@ ify himself by requiring it .
this cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen , and he eventually abandoned it .
a plot against his life was revealed , and one of his officers , Phil@@ ot@@ as , was executed for failing to alert Alexander .
the death of the son necessitated the death of the father , and thus Par@@ men@@ ion , who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ec@@ bat@@ ana , was assassinated at Alexander &apos;s command , to prevent attempts at vengeance .
most in@@ famously , Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Gran@@ icus , Cle@@ itus the Black , during a violent drunken alter@@ cation at Mar@@ ac@@ anda , in which Cle@@ itus accused Alexander of several judg@@ mental mistakes and most especially , of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle .
later , in the Central Asian campaign , a second plot against his life was revealed , this one instigated by his own royal pages .
his official historian , Call@@ is@@ then@@ es of O@@ lyn@@ thus , was implicated in the plot , and in the &quot; An@@ ab@@ asis of Alexander &quot; , Ar@@ rian states that Call@@ is@@ then@@ es and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment , and likely died soon after .
it remains unclear if Call@@ is@@ then@@ es was actually involved in the plot , for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce pro@@ sky@@ ne@@ sis .
</p>
<p>
when Alexander set out for Asia , he left his general Anti@@ p@@ ater , an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II &apos;s &quot; Old Guard , &quot; in charge of Mac@@ ed@@ on .
Alexander &apos;s s@@ acking of The@@ bes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence .
the one exception was a call to arms by Spart@@ an king Ag@@ is III in 331 BC , whom Anti@@ p@@ ater defeated and killed in the battle of Meg@@ alo@@ polis .
Anti@@ p@@ ater referred the Spart@@ ans &apos; punishment to the League of Corin@@ th , which then deferred to Alexander , who chose to pardon them .
there was also considerable friction between Anti@@ p@@ ater and Olymp@@ ias , and each complained to Alexander about the other .
in general , Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander &apos;s campaign in Asia .
Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest , which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire .
however , Alexander &apos;s constant demands for troops and the migration of Mac@@ ed@@ onians throughout his empire depleted Mac@@ ed@@ on &apos;s strength , greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander , and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War .
</p>
<p>
after the death of Sp@@ it@@ amen@@ es and his marriage to Ro@@ x@@ ana to cement relations with his new sat@@ rap@@ ies , Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent .
he invited the chief@@ tains of the former sat@@ rap@@ y of Gand@@ hara , to come to him and submit to his authority .
O@@ mp@@ his , the ruler of Tax@@ ila , whose kingdom extended from the Indu@@ s to the Hy@@ das@@ pes , complied , but the chief@@ tains of some hill clans , including the As@@ pa@@ si@@ oi and Ass@@ ak@@ en@@ oi sections of the Kam@@ bo@@ jas , refused to submit .
Amb@@ hi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents , placing himself and all his forces at his disposal .
Alexander not only returned Amb@@ hi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of &quot; Persian robes , gold and silver ornaments , 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold . &quot; Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces , and Amb@@ hi assisted Hep@@ ha@@ estion and Per@@ dic@@ cas in constructing a bridge over the Indu@@ s where it bends at Hun@@ d , supplied their troops with provisions , and received Alexander himself , and his whole army , in his capital city of Tax@@ ila , with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality .
on the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king , Tax@@ iles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the battle of the Hy@@ das@@ pes River .
after that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Por@@ us , to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms , but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy .
subsequently , however , the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander ; and Tax@@ iles , after having contributed zeal@@ ously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hy@@ das@@ pes , was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indu@@ s .
a considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip , son of Mach@@ atas ; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself , as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Tri@@ parad@@ is@@ us , 321 BC .
in the winter of 327 / 326 BC , Alexander personally led a campaign against the As@@ pa@@ si@@ oi of Kun@@ ar valleys , the Gu@@ ra@@ eans of the Gu@@ ra@@ eus valley , and the Ass@@ ak@@ en@@ oi of the Sw@@ at and Bun@@ er valleys .
a fierce contest ensued with the As@@ pa@@ si@@ oi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart , but eventually the As@@ pa@@ si@@ oi lost .
Alexander then faced the Ass@@ ak@@ en@@ oi , who fought against him from the strongholds of Mass@@ aga , Or@@ a and A@@ or@@ nos .
the fort of Mass@@ aga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting , in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle .
according to Cur@@ tius , &quot; Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Mass@@ aga , but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble . &quot; a similar slaughter followed at Or@@ a .
in the aftermath of Mass@@ aga and Or@@ a , numerous Ass@@ ak@@ en@@ ians fled to the fortress of A@@ or@@ nos .
Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill @-@ fort after four bloody days .
after A@@ or@@ nos , Alexander crossed the Indu@@ s and fought and won an epic battle against King Por@@ us , who ruled a region lying between the Hy@@ das@@ pes and the Ac@@ es@@ ines , in what is now the Punjab , in the Battle of the Hy@@ das@@ pes in 326 BC .
Alexander was impressed by Por@@ us &apos; bravery , and made him an ally .
he appointed Por@@ us as sat@@ rap , and added to Por@@ us &apos; territory land that he did not previously own , towards the south @-@ east , up to the H@@ yp@@ ha@@ sis .
choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece .
Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the Hy@@ das@@ pes river , naming one Bu@@ cephal@@ a , in honour of his horse , who died around this time .
the other was Nic@@ a@@ ea , thought to be located at the site of modern @-@ day Mong , Punjab .
</p>
<p>
East of Por@@ us &apos; kingdom , near the Gan@@ ges River , was the N@@ anda Empire of Mag@@ ad@@ ha , and further east , the G@@ ang@@ ari@@ da@@ i Empire of Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent .
fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning , Alexander &apos;s army mutin@@ ied at the H@@ yp@@ ha@@ sis River , refusing to march farther east .
this river thus marks the e@@ aster@@ nmost extent of Alexander &apos;s conqu@@ ests .
as for the Mac@@ ed@@ onians , however , their struggle with Por@@ us bl@@ unted their courage and stayed their further advance into India .
for having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who must@@ ered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse , they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Gan@@ ges also , the width of which , as they learned , was thirty @-@ two fur@@ longs , its depth a hundred fath@@ oms , while its banks on the further side were covered with multi@@ tudes of men @-@ at @-@ arms and horsemen and elephants .
for they were told that the kings of the Gan@@ der@@ ites and Pra@@ e@@ si@@ i were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen , two hundred thousand foot@@ men , eight thousand chariots , and six thousand war elephants .
Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther , but his general Co@@ en@@ us pleaded with him to change his opinion and return ; the men , he said , &quot; longed to again see their parents , their wives and children , their homeland . &quot; Alexander eventually agreed and turned south , marching along the Indu@@ s .
along the way his army conquered the Mal@@ hi and other Indian tribes and Alexander sustained an injury during the siege .
Alexander sent much of his army to Car@@ mania with general Cr@@ ater@@ us , and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admir@@ al N@@ ear@@ ch@@ us , while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the Ged@@ ro@@ sian Desert and Mak@@ ran .
Alexander reached Sus@@ a in 324 BC , but not before losing many men to the harsh desert .
</p>
<p>
discovering that many of his sat@@ rap@@ s and military governors had mis@@ behaved in his absence , Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Sus@@ a .
as a gesture of thanks , he paid off the debts of his soldiers , and announced that he would send over @-@ aged and disabled veterans back to Mac@@ ed@@ on , led by Cr@@ ater@@ us .
his troops misunderstood his intention and mutin@@ ied at the town of Op@@ is .
they refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units .
after three days , unable to persuade his men to back down , Alexander gave Per@@ sians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units .
the Mac@@ ed@@ onians quickly begged forgiveness , which Alexander accepted , and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together .
in an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects , Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other no@@ ble@@ women at Sus@@ a , but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year .
meanwhile , upon his return to Persia , Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cy@@ rus the Great in Pas@@ ar@@ gad@@ ae had desec@@ rated it , and swiftly executed them .
Alexander admired Cy@@ rus the Great , from an early age reading X@@ en@@ oph@@ on &apos;s &quot; Cy@@ ro@@ pa@@ edia &quot; , which described Cy@@ rus &apos;s heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator .
during his visit to Pas@@ ar@@ gad@@ ae Alexander ordered his architect Arist@@ ob@@ ulus to decorate the interior of the sepulch@@ ral chamber of Cy@@ rus &apos; tomb .
afterwards , Alexander travelled to Ec@@ bat@@ ana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure .
there , his closest friend and possible lover , Hep@@ ha@@ estion , died of illness or poisoning .
Hep@@ ha@@ estion &apos;s death devastated Alexander , and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral py@@ re in Babylon , as well as a decree for public mourning .
back in Babylon , Alexander planned a series of new campaigns , beginning with an invasion of Arabia , but he would not have a chance to realize them , as he died shortly after Hep@@ ha@@ estion .
</p>
<p>
on either 10 or 11 June 323 BC , Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II , in Babylon , at age 32 .
there are two different versions of Alexander &apos;s death and details of the death differ slightly in each .
Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch &apos;s account is that roughly 14 days before his death , Alexander entertained admir@@ al N@@ ear@@ ch@@ us , and spent the night and next day drinking with Medi@@ us of Lar@@ issa .
he developed a fever , which worsened until he was unable to speak .
the common soldiers , anxious about his health , were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them .
in the second account , Di@@ od@@ orus re@@ counts that Alexander was struck with pain after dow@@ ning a large bowl of un@@ mixed wine in honour of Her@@ acles , followed by 11 days of weakness ; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony .
Ar@@ rian also mentioned this as an alternative , but Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch specifically denied this claim .
given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination , foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death .
Di@@ od@@ orus , Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch , Ar@@ rian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned .
Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy , Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch dismissed it as a fabrication , while both Di@@ od@@ orus and Ar@@ rian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness .
the accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Anti@@ p@@ ater , recently removed as Macedonian vic@@ ero@@ y , and at odds with Olymp@@ ias , as the head of the alleged plot .
perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence , and having seen the fate of Par@@ men@@ ion and Phil@@ ot@@ as , Anti@@ p@@ ater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son I@@ ol@@ las , who was Alexander &apos;s wine @-@ p@@ our@@ er .
there was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated .
the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death ; such long @-@ acting poisons were probably not available .
however , in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander , Leo Sch@@ ep from the New Zealand National Po@@ isons Centre proposed that the plant white hel@@ le@@ bore , which was known in antiquity , may have been used to poison Alexander .
in a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Tox@@ icology , Sch@@ ep suggested Alexander &apos;s wine was spiked with &quot; Ver@@ at@@ rum album &quot; , and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the &quot; Alexander Rom@@ ance &quot; . &quot;
Ver@@ at@@ rum album &quot; poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned , &quot; Ver@@ at@@ rum album &quot; offers the most plausible cause .
another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Sty@@ x that contained cal@@ ic@@ he@@ am@@ icin , a dangerous compound produced by bacteria .
several natural causes have been suggested , including malaria and typhoid fever .
a 1998 article in the &quot; New England Journal of Medicine &quot; attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis .
another recent analysis suggested py@@ ogenic spon@@ dy@@ li@@ tis or meningitis .
other illnesses fit the symptoms , including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus .
natural @-@ cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander &apos;s health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds .
the anguish that Alexander felt after Hep@@ ha@@ estion &apos;s death may also have contributed to his declining health .
</p>
<p>
Alexander &apos;s body was laid in a gold anthropo@@ id sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us that was filled with honey , which was in turn placed in a gold casket .
according to A@@ el@@ ian , a se@@ er called Ari@@ stan@@ der foret@@ old that the land where Alexander was laid to rest &quot; would be happy and un@@ vanqu@@ ishable forever . &quot; perhaps more likely , the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy , since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative .
while Alexander &apos;s funeral cor@@ t@@ ege was on its way to Mac@@ ed@@ on , P@@ tol@@ emy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis .
his successor , P@@ tol@@ emy II Philadel@@ ph@@ us , transferred the sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us to Alexandria , where it remained until at least late Anti@@ quity .
P@@ tol@@ emy IX L@@ ath@@ y@@ ros , one of P@@ tol@@ emy &apos;s final successors , replaced Alexander &apos;s sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us with a glass one so he could convert the original to co@@ inage .
the recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece , at Amp@@ hi@@ polis , dating from the time of Alexander the Great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander .
this would fit with the intended destination of Alexander &apos;s funeral cor@@ t@@ ege .
Pom@@ pe@@ y , Julius Caesar and August@@ us all visited the tomb in Alexandria , where August@@ us , allegedly , accidentally knocked the nose off .
Cal@@ ig@@ ula was said to have taken Alexander &apos;s breast@@ plate from the tomb for his own use .
around AD 200 , Emperor Sep@@ tim@@ ius Sever@@ us closed Alexander &apos;s tomb to the public .
his son and successor , Carac@@ alla , a great admirer , visited the tomb during his own reign .
after this , details on the fate of the tomb are hazy .
the so @-@ called &quot; Alexander Sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us , &quot; discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archae@@ ology Museum , is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander &apos;s remains , but because its bas @-@ reli@@ efs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Per@@ sians and hunting .
it was originally thought to have been the sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us of Abd@@ al@@ onym@@ us , the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Is@@ sus in 331 .
however , more recently , it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abd@@ al@@ onym@@ us &apos; death .
</p>
<p>
Alexander &apos;s death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece , they were not immediately believed .
Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir , his son Alexander IV by Ro@@ x@@ ane being born after Alexander &apos;s death .
according to Di@@ od@@ orus , Alexander &apos;s companions asked him on his death@@ bed to whom he beque@@ athed his kingdom ; his lac@@ onic reply was &quot; t@@ ô@@ i k@@ rati@@ st@@ ô@@ i &quot; - &quot; to the strongest . &quot; another theory is that his successors will@@ fully or erroneously mish@@ ear@@ d &quot; t@@ ô@@ i Kr@@ ater@@ ô@@ i &quot; - &quot; to Cr@@ ater@@ us , &quot; the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the reg@@ ency of Macedonia .
Ar@@ rian and Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point , implying that this was an apo@@ cry@@ ph@@ al story .
Di@@ od@@ orus , Cur@@ tius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his sig@@ net ring to Per@@ dic@@ cas , a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry , in front of witnesses , thereby nominating him .
Per@@ dic@@ cas initially did not claim power , instead suggesting that Ro@@ x@@ ane &apos;s baby would be king , if male ; with himself , Cr@@ ater@@ us , Leon@@ nat@@ us , and Anti@@ p@@ ater as guardians .
however , the infantry , under the command of M@@ ele@@ ager , rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion .
instead , they supported Alexander &apos;s half @-@ brother Philip Ar@@ r@@ hid@@ a@@ eus .
eventually , the two sides reconciled , and after the birth of Alexander IV , he and Philip III were appointed joint kings , albeit in name only .
dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Mac@@ ed@@ onians , however .
the sat@@ rap@@ ies handed out by Per@@ dic@@ cas at the Parti@@ tion of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power .
after the assassination of Per@@ dic@@ cas in 321 BC , Macedonian unity collapsed , and 40 years of war between &quot; The Succ@@ essors &quot; ensued before the Hell@@ en@@ istic world settled into four stable power blocs :
P@@ tol@@ em@@ a@@ ic Egypt , Sel@@ eu@@ cid Mesopotam@@ ia and Central Asia , At@@ tal@@ id Anatol@@ ia , and Anti@@ gon@@ id Mac@@ ed@@ on .
in the process , both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered .
</p>
<p>
Di@@ od@@ orus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Cr@@ ater@@ us some time before his death .
Cr@@ ater@@ us started to carry out Alexander &apos;s commands , but the successors chose not to further implement them , on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant .
nevertheless , Per@@ dic@@ cas read Alexander &apos;s will to his troops .
Alexander &apos;s will called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean , monumental constructions , and the inter@@ mixing of Eastern and Western populations .
</p>
<p>
Alexander earned the epi@@ the@@ t &quot; the Great &quot; due to his unparalleled success as a military commander .
he never lost a battle , despite typically being outnumbered .
this was due to use of terrain , ph@@ alan@@ x and cavalry tactics , bold strategy , and the fierce loyalty of his troops .
the Macedonian ph@@ alan@@ x , armed with the sar@@ issa , a spear long , had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training , and Alexander used its speed and maneu@@ ver@@ ability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces .
Alexander also recognized the potential for dis@@ unity among his diverse army , which employed various languages and weapons .
he overcame this by being personally involved in battle , in the manner of a Macedonian king .
in his first battle in Asia , at Gran@@ icus , Alexander used only a small part of his forces , perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry , against a much larger Persian force of 40,000 .
Alexander placed the ph@@ alan@@ x at the center and cavalry and arch@@ ers on the wings , so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line , about .
by contrast , the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry .
this ensured that Alexander would not be out@@ flan@@ ked , while his ph@@ alan@@ x , armed with long pi@@ kes , had a considerable advantage over the Per@@ sians &apos; sc@@ im@@ it@@ ars and jav@@ el@@ ins .
Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Per@@ sians .
at Is@@ sus in 333 BC , his first confrontation with D@@ arius , he used the same deployment , and again the central ph@@ alan@@ x pushed through .
Alexander personally led the charge in the center , routing the opposing army .
at the decisive encounter with D@@ arius at Gau@@ gam@@ ela , D@@ arius equipped his chariots with sc@@ y@@ thes on the wheels to break up the ph@@ alan@@ x and equipped his cavalry with pi@@ kes .
Alexander arranged a double ph@@ alan@@ x , with the center advancing at an angle , parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming .
the advance was successful and broke D@@ arius &apos; center , causing the latter to flee once again .
when faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques , such as in Central Asia and India , Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents &apos; style .
thus , in Bac@@ tri@@ a and S@@ og@@ di@@ ana , Alexander successfully used his jav@@ elin throw@@ ers and arch@@ ers to prevent out@@ flan@@ king movements , while mass@@ ing his cavalry at the center .
in India , confronted by Por@@ us &apos; elephant corps , the Mac@@ ed@@ onians opened their ranks to envel@@ op the elephants and used their sar@@ iss@@ as to strike upwards and dis@@ lodge the elephants &apos; handlers .
</p>
<p>
Greek bi@@ ographer Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch describes Alexander &apos;s appearance as : the outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Ly@@ sip@@ pus made , and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled .
for those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate , namely , the poise of the neck , which was bent slightly to the left , and the melting glance of his eyes , this artist has accurately observed .
Ap@@ elles , however , in painting him as wi@@ elder of the thunder @-@ bolt , did not reproduce his complexion , but made it too dark and s@@ war@@ thy .
whereas he was of a fair colour , as they say , and his fairness passed into rud@@ diness on his breast particularly , and in his face .
moreover , that a very pleasant odour exhal@@ ed from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh , so that his garments were filled with it , this we have read in the &quot; M@@ emo@@ irs of Arist@@ ox@@ en@@ us &quot; .
Greek historian Ar@@ rian described Alexander as : &#91; T &#93; he strong , handsome commander with one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky .
the semi @-@ legendary &quot; Alexander Rom@@ ance &quot; also suggests that Alexander exhibited hetero@@ chrom@@ ia i@@ rid@@ um : that one eye was dark and the other light .
British historian Peter Green provided a description of Alexander &apos;s appearance , based on his review of statues and some ancient documents : physically , Alexander was not pre@@ possessing .
even by Macedonian standards he was very short , though stock@@ y and tough .
his beard was scanty , and he stood out against his hir@@ su@@ te Macedonian bar@@ ons by going clean @-@ sha@@ ven .
his neck was in some way twisted , so that he appeared to be gazing upward at an angle .
his eyes revealed a dew@@ y , feminine quality .
he had a high complexion and a harsh voice .
ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by Ly@@ sip@@ pos that he forbade other sculp@@ tors from crafting his image .
Ly@@ sip@@ pos had often used the contra@@ p@@ pos@@ to sculp@@ tural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as Apo@@ xy@@ omen@@ os , Hermes and E@@ ros .
Ly@@ sip@@ pos &apos; sculpture , famous for its natur@@ alism , as opposed to a sti@@ ffer , more static pose , is thought to be the most faithful depiction .
</p>
<p>
some of Alexander &apos;s strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents .
his mother had huge ambitions , and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire .
Olymp@@ ias &apos; influence instilled a sense of destiny in him , and Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch tells how his ambition &quot; kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years . &quot; however , his father Philip was Alexander &apos;s most immediate and influential role model , as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year , winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds .
Alexander &apos;s relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality ; he had a need to out@@ do his father , illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle .
while Alexander worried that his father would leave him &quot; no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world , &quot; he also down@@ played his father &apos;s achievements to his companions .
according to Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch , among Alexander &apos;s traits were a violent temper and rash , impulsive nature , which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions .
although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father , he was open to reasoned debate .
he had a calmer side - percep@@ tive , logical , and calculating .
he had a great desire for knowledge , a love for philosophy , and was an avid reader .
this was no doubt in part due to Aristotle &apos;s tutel@@ age ; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn .
his intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general .
he had great self @-@ restraint in &quot; pleasures of the body , &quot; in contrast with his lack of self @-@ control with alcohol .
Alexander was er@@ ud@@ ite and patron@@ ized both arts and sciences .
however , he had little interest in sports or the Olympic games , seeking only the Hom@@ eric ideals of honour and glory .
he had great charisma and force of personality , characteristics which made him a great leader .
his unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death - only Alexander had the ability to do so .
during his final years , and especially after the death of Hep@@ ha@@ estion , Alexander began to exhibit signs of me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania and paranoia .
his extraordinary achievements , coupled with his own ine@@ ff@@ able sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions , may have combined to produce this effect .
his delu@@ sions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world , in as much as he is by various sources described as having &quot; boundless ambition &quot; , an epi@@ the@@ t , the meaning of which has descended into an historical cl@@ ich@@ é .
he appears to have believed himself a deity , or at least sought to de@@ ify himself .
Olymp@@ ias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus , a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of A@@ mun at Si@@ wa .
he began to identify himself as the son of Zeus @-@ Ammon .
Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court , notably &quot; pro@@ sky@@ ne@@ sis &quot; , a practice of which Mac@@ ed@@ onians disapproved , and were loath to perform .
this behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen .
however , Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples , many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine .
thus , rather than me@@ gal@@ om@@ ania , his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together .
</p>
<p>
Alexander married three times : Ro@@ x@@ ana , daughter of the S@@ og@@ dian nobl@@ eman Ox@@ yar@@ tes of Bac@@ tri@@ a , out of love ; and the Persian princ@@ esses Stat@@ eira II and Par@@ ys@@ atis II , the former a daughter of D@@ arius III and latter a daughter of Ar@@ tax@@ er@@ xes III , for political reasons .
he apparently had two sons , Alexander IV of Mac@@ ed@@ on by Ro@@ x@@ ana and , possibly , Her@@ acles of Mac@@ ed@@ on from his mistress Bar@@ sine .
he lost another child when Ro@@ x@@ ana mis@@ carried at Babylon .
Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend , general , and bodyguard Hep@@ ha@@ estion , the son of a Macedonian noble .
Hep@@ ha@@ estion &apos;s death devastated Alexander .
this event may have contributed to Alexander &apos;s failing health and detached mental state during his final months .
Alexander &apos;s sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times .
the Roman era writer Ath@@ en@@ a@@ eus says , based on the scholar Dic@@ a@@ ear@@ ch@@ us , who was Alexander &apos;s contemporary , that the king &quot; was also very much in the habit of giving in to this fashion &quot; , and that Alexander sexually embraced his eun@@ uch Bag@@ o@@ as in public .
this episode is also told by Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch , probably based on the same source .
no ancient writer , however , explicitly describes Alexander &apos;s relationship with Hep@@ ha@@ estion as sexual , though the pair was often compared to Achilles and Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us , whom classical Greek culture painted as a couple .
A@@ el@@ ian writes of Alexander &apos;s visit to Troy where &quot; Alexander gar@@ landed the tomb of Achilles , and Hep@@ ha@@ estion that of Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us , the latter hin@@ ting that he was a beloved of Alexander , in just the same way as Pat@@ ro@@ cl@@ us was of Achilles . &quot; some modern historians believe not only that Alexander &apos;s youthful relationship with Hep@@ ha@@ estion was sexual , but that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood , which went against the social norms of at least some Greek cities , such as Athens , though some modern researchers have provisionally proposed that Macedonia may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults .
Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women ; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life .
however , he was relatively young when he died , and Og@@ den suggests that Alexander &apos;s matrimonial record is more impressive than his father &apos;s at the same age .
apart from wives , Alexander had many more female companions .
Alexander accumulated a ha@@ rem in the style of Persian kings , but he used it rather sparingly , showing great self @-@ control in &quot; pleasures of the body . &quot; nevertheless , Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch described how Alexander was infat@@ uated by Ro@@ x@@ ana while compli@@ menting him on not forcing himself on her .
Green suggested that , in the context of the period , Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women , including Ad@@ a of C@@ aria , who adopted him , and even D@@ arius &apos; mother Sis@@ yg@@ amb@@ is , who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander &apos;s death .
</p>
<p>
Alexander &apos;s legacy extended beyond his military conqu@@ ests .
his campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West , and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence .
some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers , many surviving into the 21st century .
his chron@@ ic@@ lers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched , while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean .
</p>
<p>
Alexander &apos;s most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swa@@ thes of Asia .
at the time of his death , Alexander &apos;s empire covered some , and was the largest state of its time .
many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200 @-@ 300 years .
the successor states that emerged were , at least initially , dominant forces , and these 300 years are often referred to as the Hell@@ en@@ istic period .
the eastern borders of Alexander &apos;s empire began to collapse even during his lifetime .
however , the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history , the Maur@@ ya Empire .
taking advantage of this power vacuum , Chandra@@ gupta Maur@@ ya , of relatively humble origin , took control of the Punjab , and with that power base proceeded to conquer the N@@ anda Empire .
</p>
<p>
over the course of his conqu@@ ests , Alexander founded some twenty cities that bore his name , most of them east of the Tig@@ ris .
the first , and greatest , was Alexandria in Egypt , which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities .
the cities &apos; locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions .
at first , the cities must have been inhospitable , little more than defensive gar@@ ris@@ ons .
following Alexander &apos;s death , many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece .
however , a century or so after Alexander &apos;s death , many of the Alexand@@ ri@@ as were thriving , with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples .
</p>
<p>
in 334 BC , Alexander the Great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of Athena Poli@@ as in Pri@@ ene .
an inscription from the temple , now housed in the British Museum , declares :
&quot; King Alexander dedicated &#91; this temple &#93; to Athena Poli@@ as . &quot; this inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from Alexander &apos;s life .
the temple was designed by Py@@ the@@ os , one of the architects of the Ma@@ us@@ oleum at Hal@@ ic@@ ar@@ nas@@ sus .
</p>
<p>
&quot; Hell@@ en@@ ization &quot; was coined by the German historian Johann Gust@@ av Dro@@ ys@@ en to denote the spread of Greek language , culture , and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander &apos;s conquest .
that this export took place is undoubted , and can be seen in the great Hell@@ en@@ istic cities of , for instance , Alexandria , Anti@@ och and Sel@@ eu@@ cia .
Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybri@@ di@@ ze Greek and Persian culture .
this culminated in his aspiration to homogen@@ ize the populations of Asia and Europe .
however , his successors explicitly rejected such policies .
nevertheless , Hell@@ en@@ ization occurred throughout the region , accompanied by a distinct and opposite &apos; Orient@@ alization &apos; of the successor states .
the core of the Hell@@ en@@ istic culture promulgated by the conqu@@ ests was essentially Ath@@ en@@ ian .
the close association of men from across Greece in Alexander &apos;s army directly led to the emergence of the largely At@@ tic @-@ based &quot; ko@@ ine , &quot; or &quot; common &quot; Greek dialect .
Ko@@ ine spread throughout the Hell@@ en@@ istic world , becoming the lingu@@ a fran@@ ca of Hell@@ en@@ istic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern Greek .
furthermore , town planning , education , local government , and art current in the Hell@@ en@@ istic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals , evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hell@@ en@@ istic .
aspects of Hell@@ en@@ istic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid @-@ 15th century .
some of the most pronounced effects of Hell@@ en@@ ization can be seen in Afghanistan and India , in the region of the relatively late @-@ rising G@@ rec@@ o @-@ Bac@@ tri@@ an Kingdom and the Indo @-@ Greek Kingdom in modern Afghanistan and India .
there on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybri@@ di@@ zed with Indian , and especially Buddhist culture .
the resulting syn@@ cre@@ tism known as G@@ rec@@ o @-@ Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of G@@ rec@@ o @-@ Buddhist art .
these G@@ rec@@ o @-@ Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China , Sri Lanka , and the Mediterranean .
some of the first and most influential figur@@ ative portra@@ yals of the Buddha appeared at this time , perhaps modeled on Greek statues of Apollo in the G@@ rec@@ o @-@ Buddhist style .
several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion : the concept of Bo@@ dd@@ his@@ at@@ vas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes , and some Maha@@ yana ceremonial practices are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks ; however , similar practices were also observed amongst the native In@@ dic culture .
one Greek king , Men@@ ander I , probably became Buddhist , and was im@@ mort@@ alized in Buddhist literature as &apos; Mil@@ inda &apos; .
the process of Hell@@ en@@ ization also spurred trade between the east and west .
for example , Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the G@@ rec@@ o @-@ Bac@@ tri@@ an city of Ai Khan@@ oum in modern @-@ day Afghanistan , while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually suppl@@ anted the long @-@ standing Indian cosm@@ ological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain like the petals of a flower .
the Y@@ av@@ an@@ aj@@ at@@ aka and Paul@@ isa Sid@@ d@@ han@@ ta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy .
following the conqu@@ ests of Alexander the Great in the east , Hell@@ en@@ istic influence on Indian art was far @-@ ranging .
in the area of architecture , a few examples of the I@@ onic order can be found as far as Pakistan with the Jan@@ dial temple near Tax@@ ila .
several examples of capitals displaying I@@ onic influences can be seen as far as Pat@@ na , especially with the Pat@@ ali@@ pu@@ tra capital , dated to the 3rd century BC .
the Corin@@ th@@ ian order is also heavily represented in the art of Gand@@ hara , especially through Indo @-@ Corin@@ th@@ ian capitals .

Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans , especially generals , who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements .
Poly@@ bi@@ us began his &quot; Hist@@ ories &quot; by reminding Romans of Alexander &apos;s achievements , and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model .
Pom@@ pe@@ y the Great adopted the epi@@ the@@ t &quot; Magn@@ us &quot; and even Alexander &apos;s an@@ ast@@ ole @-@ type haircut , and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander &apos;s 260 @-@ year @-@ old cloak , which he then wore as a sign of greatness .
Julius Caesar dedicated a Ly@@ sip@@ pe@@ an equ@@ estrian bronze statue but replaced Alexander &apos;s head with his own , while Oc@@ ta@@ vian visited Alexander &apos;s tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sph@@ inx to Alexander &apos;s profile .
the emperor Tra@@ jan also admired Alexander , as did N@@ ero and Carac@@ alla .
the Mac@@ ri@@ ani , a Roman family that in the person of Mac@@ rin@@ us briefly ascended to the imperial throne , kept images of Alexander on their persons , either on jewelry , or embroidered into their clothes .
on the other hand , some Roman writers , particularly Republican figures , used Alexander as a cau@@ tionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values .
Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as am@@ ic@@ ita and cle@@ men@@ tia , but also ir@@ ac@@ un@@ dia and cup@@ id@@ itas glori@@ ae .
</p>
<p>
legendary accounts surround the life of Alexander the Great , many deriving from his own lifetime , probably encouraged by Alexander himself .
his court historian Call@@ is@@ then@@ es portrayed the sea in C@@ il@@ ic@@ ia as drawing back from him in pro@@ sky@@ ne@@ sis .
writing shortly after Alexander &apos;s death , another participant , On@@ es@@ ic@@ rit@@ us , invented a try@@ st between Alexander and Thal@@ estr@@ is , queen of the mythical Amaz@@ ons .
when On@@ es@@ ic@@ rit@@ us read this passage to his patron , Alexander &apos;s general and later King Ly@@ sim@@ ach@@ us reportedly qu@@ ipped , &quot; I wonder where I was at the time . &quot; in the first centuries after Alexander &apos;s death , probably in Alexandria , a quantity of the legendary material coales@@ ced into a text known as the &quot; Alexander Rom@@ ance &quot; , later falsely ascribed to Call@@ is@@ then@@ es and therefore known as &quot; P@@ seud@@ o @-@ Call@@ is@@ then@@ es &quot; .
this text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Anti@@ quity and the Middle Ages , containing many dubious stories , and was translated into numerous languages .

Alexander the Great &apos;s accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures .
Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day .
the &quot; Alexander Rom@@ ance &quot; , in particular , has had a significant impact on portra@@ yals of Alexander in later cultures , from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek .
Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore , more so than any other ancient figure .
the colloqu@@ ial form of his name in modern Greek is a household name , and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the Kar@@ ag@@ io@@ z@@ is shadow play .
one well @-@ known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship &apos;s pro@@ w during a storm and ask the captain &quot; Is King Alexander alive ? &quot; the correct answer is &quot; He is alive and well and rules the world ! &quot; causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm .
any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging G@@ org@@ on who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea , all hands aboard .
in pre @-@ Islamic Middle Persian literature , Alexander is referred to by the epi@@ the@@ t &quot; gu@@ j@@ ast@@ ak &quot; , meaning &quot; accur@@ sed , &quot; and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zor@@ o@@ ast@@ ri@@ anism .
in Sunni Islamic Persia , under the influence of the &quot; Alexander Rom@@ ance &quot; , a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges .
Fir@@ dau@@ si &apos;s &quot; Sha@@ hn@@ ame@@ h &quot; includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Persian sha@@ hs , a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the F@@ oun@@ tain of Youth .
later Persian writers associate him with philosophy , portraying him at a symposium with figures such as Socrates , Plato and Aristotle , in search of immortality .
the figure of D@@ hu@@ l @-@ Qar@@ n@@ ayn mentioned in the Qur@@ an is believed by some scholars to represent Alexander , due to parallels with the &quot; Alexander Rom@@ ance &quot; .
in this tradition , he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of Go@@ g and Mag@@ og .
he then travelled the known world in search of the Water of Life and Im@@ mortality , eventually becoming a prophet .
the Syri@@ ac version of the &quot; Alexander Rom@@ ance &quot; portrays him as an ideal Christian world conquer@@ or who prayed to &quot; the one true God . &quot; in Egypt , Alexander was portrayed as the son of Nec@@ tan@@ e@@ bo II , the last phar@@ aoh before the Persian conquest .
his defeat of D@@ arius was depicted as Egypt &apos;s salvation , &quot; proving &quot; Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian .
according to Joseph@@ us , Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel when he entered Jerusalem , which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire .
this is cited as a reason for sparing Jerusalem .
in Hindi and Ur@@ du , the name &quot; Si@@ k@@ and@@ ar , &quot; derived from Persian , denotes a rising young talent .
in medieval Europe , Alexander the Great was revered as a member of the Nine Wor@@ th@@ ies , a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsul@@ ate all the ideal qualities of chival@@ ry .
Irish play@@ wright Au@@ bre@@ y Thomas de V@@ ere wrote &quot; Alexander the Great , a Dra@@ matic Po@@ em &quot; .
British heavy Metal band Iron Ma@@ iden had Alexander the Great as a track on the 1986 &quot; Some@@ where in Time &quot; Album .
the song written by bass player Steve Harris captures and summar@@ ises Alexand@@ ers battles and life .
it was one of the first Ma@@ iden albums to use guitar syn@@ ths .
</p>
<p>
apart from a few inscriptions and fragments , texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost .
contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander &apos;s campaign historian Call@@ is@@ then@@ es ; Alexander &apos;s generals P@@ tol@@ emy and N@@ ear@@ ch@@ us ; Arist@@ ob@@ ulus , a junior officer on the campaigns ; and On@@ es@@ ic@@ rit@@ us , Alexander &apos;s chief hel@@ m@@ sman .
their works are lost , but later works based on these original sources have survived .
the earliest of these is Di@@ od@@ orus Sic@@ ulus , followed by Quin@@ tus Cur@@ tius Ru@@ f@@ us , Ar@@ rian , the bi@@ ographer Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch , and finally Justin , whose work dated as late as the 4th century .
of these , Ar@@ rian is generally considered the most reliable , given that he used P@@ tol@@ emy and Arist@@ ob@@ ulus as his sources , closely followed by Di@@ od@@ orus .

Alfred Hab@@ d@@ ank Sk@@ ar@@ bek Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski was a Polish @-@ American independent scholar who developed a field called general semantics , which he viewed as both distinct from , and more encompassing than , the field of semantics .
he argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed , and thus no one can have direct access to reality , given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain &apos;s responses to reality .
his best known dictum is &quot; The map is not the territory . &quot;
</p>
<p>
born in Warsaw , Poland , then part of the Russian Empire , Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski belonged to an aristocratic Polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians , scientists , and engineers for generations .
he learned the Polish language at home and the Russian language in schools ; and having a French and German govern@@ ess , he became fluent in four languages as a child .
Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski studied engineering at the Warsaw University of Technology .
during the First World War Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski served as an intelligence officer in the Russian Army .
after being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries , he moved to North America in 1916 to coordinate the shipment of artillery to Russia .
he also lectured to Polish @-@ American audiences about the conflict , promoting the sale of war bonds .
after the war he decided to remain in the United States , becoming a naturalized citizen in 1940 .
he met M@@ ira Ed@@ ger@@ ly , a painter of portraits on ivory , shortly after the 1918 Armistice ; They married in January 1919 ; the marriage lasted until his death .
E. P. Dut@@ ton published Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski &apos;s first book , &quot; Man@@ hood of Humanity &quot; , in 1921 .
in this work he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind : mankind as a &quot; time @-@ binding &quot; class of life .
</p>
<p>
Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski &apos;s work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named general semantics .
this should not be confused with semantics .
the basic principles of general semantics , which include time @-@ binding , are described in the publication &quot; Science and San@@ ity &quot; , published in 1933 .
in 1938 Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski founded the Institute of General Sem@@ antics in Chicago .
the post @-@ World War II housing shortage in Chicago cost him the Institute &apos;s building lease , so in 1946 he moved the Institute to Lak@@ eville , Connecticut , U.S. , where he directed it until his death in 1950 .
Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by the structure of their nervous systems , and the structure of their languages .
humans cannot experience the world directly , but only through their &quot; abstr@@ actions &quot; .
these sometimes mislead us about what is the truth .
our understanding sometimes lacks &quot; similarity of structure &quot; with what is actually happening .
he sought to train our awareness of abstr@@ acting , using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science .
he called this awareness , this goal of his system , &quot; consciousness of abstr@@ acting . &quot; his system included the promotion of attitudes such as &quot; I don &apos;t know ; let &apos;s see , &quot; in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science .
another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet , an experience he termed , &quot; silence on the objective levels . &quot;
</p>
<p>
many devot@@ ees and critics of Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form &quot; is &quot; of the general verb &quot; to be . &quot; his system , however , is based primarily on such terminology as the different &quot; orders of abstraction , &quot; and formulations such as &quot; consciousness of abstr@@ acting . &quot; the contention that Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski &quot; opposed &quot; the use of the verb &quot; to be &quot; would be a profound exaggeration .
he thought that &quot; certain uses &quot; of the verb &quot; to be , &quot; called the &quot; is of identity &quot; and the &quot; is of pre@@ dication , &quot; were faulty in structure , e.g. , a statement such as , &quot; Elizabeth is a fool &quot; .
in Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski &apos;s system , one &apos;s assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself .
Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski &apos;s remedy was to &quot; deny &quot; identity ; in this example , to be aware continually that &quot; Elizabeth &quot; is &quot; not &quot; what we &quot; call &quot; her .
we find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain , the world of words , but the nonverbal domain .
this was expressed by Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski &apos;s most famous premise , &quot; the map is not the territory . &quot; note that this premise uses the phrase &quot; is not , &quot; a form of &quot; to be &quot; ; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon &quot; to be &quot; as such .
in fact , he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb &quot; to be &quot; when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location .
it was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb &quot; to be , &quot; as long as one was aware of their structural limitations .
</p>
<p>
one day , Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski was giving a lecture to a group of students , and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits , wrapped in white paper , from his briefcase .
he muttered that he just had to eat something , and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit .
a few students took a biscuit .
&quot; nice biscuit , don &apos;t you think , &quot; said Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski , while he took a second one .
the students were chewing vigorously .
then he tore the white paper from the biscuits , in order to reveal the original packaging .
on it was a big picture of a dog &apos;s head and the words &quot; Dog Coo@@ k@@ ies . &quot; the students looked at the package , and were shocked .
two of them wanted to vomit , put their hands in front of their mouths , and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet .
&quot; you see , &quot; Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski remarked , &quot; I have just demonstrated that people don &apos;t just eat food , but also words , and that the taste of the former is often out@@ done by the taste of the latter . &quot; William Bur@@ rough@@ s went to a Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski workshop in the Autumn of 1939 .
he was 25 years old , and paid $ 40 .
his fellow students - there were 38 in all - included young Samuel I. Hay@@ ak@@ awa , Ralph M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty de@@ B@@ it and Wend@@ ell Johnson .
</p>
<p>
Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski was well received in numerous disciplines , as evidenced by the positive reactions from leading figures in the sciences and humanities in the 1940s and 1950s .
as reported in the third edition of &quot; Science and San@@ ity &quot; , in World War II the US Army used Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski &apos;s system to treat battle fatigue in Europe , under the supervision of Dr. Douglas M. Kel@@ ley , who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of the Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg .
some of the General Sem@@ antics tradition was continued by Samuel I. Hay@@ ak@@ awa .

there is no surviving first @-@ hand account of At@@ til@@ a &apos;s appearance , but there is a possible second @-@ hand source provided by Jord@@ anes , who cites a description given by Pris@@ cus .
he was a man born into the world to shake the nations , the scourge of all lands , who in some way terrified all mankind by the dreadful rumors no@@ ised abroad concerning him .
he was haughty in his walk , rolling his eyes hither and thither , so that the power of his proud spirit appeared in the movement of his body .
he was indeed a lover of war , yet restrained in action , mighty in counsel , gracious to suppli@@ ants and lenient to those who were once received into his protection .
short of stature , with a broad chest and a large head ; his eyes were small , his beard thin and sprinkled with grey ; and he had a flat nose and t@@ anned skin , showing evidence of his origin .
some scholars have suggested that this description is typically East Asian , because it has all the combined features that fit the physical type of people from Eastern Asia , and At@@ til@@ a &apos;s ancestors may have come from there .
other historians also believed that the same descriptions were also evident on some Scy@@ th@@ ian people .
</p>
<p>
many scholars have argued that At@@ til@@ a derives from East German@@ ic origin ;
&quot; At@@ til@@ a &quot; is formed from the Gothic or G@@ epid@@ ic noun &quot; atta &quot; , &quot; father , &quot; by means of the dimin@@ u@@ tive suff@@ ix &quot; -@@ ila &quot; , meaning &quot; little father . &quot; the Gothic et@@ ym@@ ology was first proposed by Jacob and Wilhelm Gri@@ mm in the early 19th century .
Ma@@ en@@ chen @-@ Hel@@ fen notes that this derivation of the name &quot; offers neither phonetic nor semantic difficulties , &quot; and Gerhard Do@@ er@@ fer notes that the name is simply correct Gothic .
the name has sometimes been interpreted as a German@@ ization of a name of Hun@@ nic origin .
other scholars have argued for a Turkic origin of the name .
the stressed back syllab@@ ic &quot; til &quot; assimilated the front member &quot; es &quot; , so it became * &quot; as &quot; .

<p>
the histor@@ i@@ ography of At@@ til@@ a is faced with a major challenge , in that the only complete sources are written in Greek and Latin by the enemies of the Hun@@ s .
At@@ til@@ a &apos;s contemporaries left many testimon@@ ials of his life , but only fragments of these remain .
Pris@@ cus was a Byzantine diplomat and historian who wrote in Greek , and he was both a witness to and an actor in the story of At@@ til@@ a , as a member of the embassy of The@@ o@@ do@@ sius II at the Hun@@ nic court in 449 .
he was obviously biased by his political position , but his writing is a major source for information on the life of At@@ til@@ a , and he is the only person known to have recorded a physical description of him .
he wrote a history of the late Roman Empire in eight books covering the period from 430 to 476 .
today we have only fragments of Pris@@ cus &apos; work , but it was cited extensively by 6th @-@ century historians Pro@@ cop@@ ius and Jord@@ anes , especially in Jord@@ anes &apos; &quot; The Origin and De@@ eds of the Go@@ ths &quot; .
it contains numerous references to Pris@@ cus &apos;s history , and it is also an important source of information about the Hun@@ nic empire and its neighbors .
he describes the legacy of At@@ til@@ a and the Hun@@ nic people for a century after At@@ til@@ a &apos;s death .
Mar@@ cell@@ in@@ us Com@@ es , a chancellor of Jus@@ tin@@ ian during the same era , also describes the relations between the Hun@@ s and the Eastern Roman Empire .
numerous ec@@ clesiastical writings contain useful but scattered information , sometimes difficult to authenticate or distorted by years of hand @-@ copying between the 6th and 17th centuries .
the Hungarian writers of the 12th century wished to portray the Hun@@ s in a positive light as their glorious ancestors , and so repressed certain historical elements and added their own legends .
the literature and knowledge of the Hun@@ s themselves was transmitted orally , by means of ep@@ ics and chan@@ ted poems that were handed down from generation to generation .
indirectly , fragments of this oral history have reached us via the literature of the Scandin@@ avi@@ ans and Germans , neighbors of the Hun@@ s who wrote between the 9th and 13th centuries .
At@@ til@@ a is a major character in many Medi@@ eval ep@@ ics , such as the Ni@@ bel@@ un@@ gen@@ lied , as well as various Ed@@ das and sag@@ as .

<p>
the Hun@@ s were a group of Eurasian nomads , appearing from east of the Vol@@ ga , who migrated further into Western Europe c .
370 and built up an enormous empire there .
their main military techniques were mounted archery and jav@@ elin throwing .
they were in the process of developing settlements before their arrival in Western Europe , yet the Hun@@ s were a society of pastoral warriors whose primary form of nourishment was meat and milk , products of their herds .
the origin and language of the Hun@@ s has been the subject of debate for centuries .
according to some theories , their leaders at least may have spoken a Turkic language , perhaps closest to the modern Chu@@ v@@ ash language .
one scholar suggests a relationship to Yen@@ is@@ ei@@ an .
according to the &quot; En@@ cycl@@ opedia of European Peoples &quot; , &quot; the Hun@@ s , especially those who migrated to the west , may have been a combination of central Asian Turkic , Mongol@@ ic , and U@@ gr@@ ic stocks . &quot; At@@ til@@ a &apos;s father M@@ und@@ zu@@ k was the brother of kings Oc@@ tar and Ru@@ ga , who reigned jointly over the Hun@@ nic empire in the early fifth century .
this form of di@@ archy was recurrent with the Hun@@ s , but historians are unsure whether it was institutionalized , merely customary , or an occasional occurrence .
his family was from a noble lineage , but it is uncertain whether they constituted a royal dynasty .
At@@ til@@ a &apos;s birth@@ date is debated ; journalist É@@ ric Des@@ cho@@ dt and writer Herman Sch@@ re@@ i@@ ber have proposed a date of 395 .
however , historian I@@ ar@@ o@@ slav Le@@ be@@ dy@@ n@@ sky and archae@@ ologist Kat@@ alin E@@ sch@@ er prefer an estimate between the 39@@ 0s and the first decade of the fifth century .
several historians have proposed 406 as the date .
At@@ til@@ a grew up in a rapidly changing world .
his people were nomads who had only recently arrived in Europe .
they crossed the Vol@@ ga river during the 37@@ 0s and annexed the territory of the Al@@ ans , then attacked the Gothic kingdom between the Car@@ path@@ ian mountains and the Danube .
they were a very mobile people , whose mounted arch@@ ers had acquired a reputation for invinci@@ bility , and the German@@ ic tribes seemed unable to withstand them .
vast populations fleeing the Hun@@ s moved from Ger@@ mania into the Roman Empire in the west and south , and along the banks of the Rhine and Danube .
in 376 , the Go@@ ths crossed the Danube , initially submitting to the Romans but soon rebel@@ ling against Emperor Val@@ ens , whom they killed in the Battle of Adri@@ ano@@ ple in 378 .
large numbers of V@@ and@@ als , Al@@ ans , Su@@ e@@ bi , and Bur@@ gun@@ dians crossed the Rhine and invaded Roman G@@ aul on December 31 , 406 to escape the Hun@@ s .
the Roman Empire had been split in half since 395 and was ruled by two distinct governments , one based in Ra@@ ven@@ na in the West , and the other in Constan@@ tin@@ o@@ ple in the East .
the Roman Em@@ per@@ ors , both East and West , were generally from the The@@ o@@ do@@ sian family in At@@ til@@ a &apos;s lifetime .
the Hun@@ s dominated a vast territory with nebul@@ ous borders determined by the will of a constellation of ethnically varied peoples .
some were assimilated to Hun@@ nic nationality , whereas many retained their own identities and rulers but acknowledged the su@@ zer@@ ain@@ ty of the king of the Hun@@ s .
the Hun@@ s were also the indirect source of many of the Romans &apos; problems , driving various German@@ ic tribes into Roman territory , yet relations between the two empires were cordial : the Romans used the Hun@@ s as mercenaries against the Germans and even in their civil wars .
thus , the usur@@ per Jo@@ ann@@ es was able to recruit thousands of Hun@@ s for his army against Valen@@ tin@@ ian III in 424 .
it was A@@ ë@@ tius , later Patric@@ ian of the West , who managed this operation .
they exchanged ambassadors and hostages , the alliance lasting from 401 to 450 and permitting the Romans numerous military victories .
the Hun@@ s considered the Romans to be paying them tribute , whereas the Romans preferred to view this as payment for services rendered .
the Hun@@ s had become a great power by the time that At@@ til@@ a came of age during the reign of his uncle Ru@@ ga , to the point that Nest@@ ori@@ us , the Patri@@ arch of Constan@@ tin@@ o@@ ple , deplored the situation with these words :
&quot; they have become both masters and slaves of the Romans . &quot;
</p>
<p>
the death of Rug@@ ila in 434 left the sons of his brother M@@ und@@ zu@@ k , At@@ til@@ a and B@@ led@@ a , in control of the united Hun tribes .
at the time of the two brothers &apos; accession , the Hun tribes were bargaining with Eastern Roman Emperor The@@ o@@ do@@ sius II &apos;s envoys for the return of several who had taken refuge within the Eastern Roman Empire , possibly Hun@@ nic nobles who disagreed with the brothers &apos; assumption of leadership .
the following year , At@@ til@@ a and B@@ led@@ a met with the imperial leg@@ ation at Mar@@ gus , all seated on horseback in the Hun@@ nic manner , and negotiated an advantageous treaty .
the Romans agreed to return the fugitives , to double their previous tribute of 350 Roman pounds of gold , to open their markets to Hun@@ nish traders , and to pay a ransom of eight &quot; sol@@ idi &quot; for each Roman taken prisoner by the Hun@@ s .
the Hun@@ s , satisfied with the treaty , dec@@ amped from the Roman Empire and returned to their home in the Great Hungarian Plain , perhaps to consolidate and strengthen their empire .
The@@ o@@ do@@ sius used this opportunity to strengthen the walls of Constan@@ tin@@ o@@ ple , building the city &apos;s first sea wall , and to build up his border defenses along the Danube .
the Hun@@ s remained out of Roman sight for the next few years while they invaded the Sass@@ an@@ id Empire .
they were defeated in Armenia by the Sass@@ an@@ ids , abandoned their invasion , and turned their attentions back to Europe .
in 440 , they reappeared in force on the borders of the Roman Empire , attacking the merchants at the market on the north bank of the Danube that had been established by the treaty .
crossing the Danube , they laid waste to the cities of Il@@ ly@@ ric@@ um and forts on the river , including V@@ im@@ in@@ ac@@ ium , a city of Mo@@ esia .
their advance began at Mar@@ gus , where they demanded that the Romans turn over a bishop who had retained property that At@@ til@@ a regarded as his .
while the Romans discussed the bishop &apos;s fate , he slipped away secretly to the Hun@@ s and betrayed the city to them .
while the Hun@@ s attacked city @-@ states along the Danube , the V@@ and@@ als captured the Western Roman province of Africa and its capital of Car@@ th@@ age .
Car@@ th@@ age was the richest province of the Western Empire and a main source of food for Rome .
the Sass@@ an@@ id Shah Yaz@@ deg@@ er@@ d II invaded Armenia in 441 .
the Romans stripped the Balkan area of forces , sending them to Sicily in order to mount an expedition against the V@@ and@@ als in Africa .
this left At@@ til@@ a and B@@ led@@ a a clear path through Il@@ ly@@ ric@@ um into the Balkans , which they invaded in 441 .
the Hun@@ nish army sacked Mar@@ gus and V@@ im@@ in@@ ac@@ ium , and then took Sing@@ id@@ un@@ um and Sirmium .
during 442 , The@@ o@@ do@@ sius recalled his troops from Sicily and ordered a large issue of new coins to finance operations against the Hun@@ s .
he believed that he could defeat the Hun@@ s and refused the Hun@@ nish kings &apos; demands .
At@@ til@@ a responded with a campaign in 443 .
the Hun@@ s were equipped with new military weapons as they advanced along the Danube , such as battering rams and rolling siege towers , and they over@@ ran the military centers of Rati@@ ara and successfully besieged Na@@ issus .
advancing along the Ni@@ š@@ ava River , the Hun@@ s next took Ser@@ dic@@ a , Philip@@ po@@ polis , and Ar@@ cad@@ io@@ polis .
they encountered and destroyed a Roman army outside Constan@@ tin@@ o@@ ple but were stopped by the double walls of the Eastern capital .
they defeated a second army near Calli@@ polis .
The@@ o@@ do@@ sius , stripped of his armed forces , admitted defeat , sending the &quot; Mag@@ ister milit@@ um per Orient@@ em &quot; Anat@@ oli@@ us to negotiate peace terms .
the terms were harsher than the previous treaty : the Emperor agreed to hand over 6,000 Roman pounds of gold as punishment for having dis@@ obeyed the terms of the treaty during the invasion ; the yearly tribute was tripled , rising to 2,100 Roman pounds in gold ; and the ransom for each Roman prisoner rose to 12 &quot; sol@@ idi &quot; .
their demands were met for a time , and the Hun kings withdrew into the interior of their empire .
B@@ led@@ a died following the Hun@@ s &apos; withdrawal from Byz@@ anti@@ um .
At@@ til@@ a then took the throne for himself , becoming the sole ruler of the Hun@@ s .
</p>
<p>
in 447 , At@@ til@@ a again rode south into the Eastern Roman Empire through Mo@@ esia .
the Roman army , under Gothic &quot; mag@@ ister milit@@ um &quot; Ar@@ neg@@ is@@ cl@@ us , met him in the Battle of the U@@ tus and was defeated , though not without inflicting heavy losses .
the Hun@@ s were left un@@ opposed and ramp@@ aged through the Balkans as far as Ther@@ m@@ op@@ y@@ la@@ e .
Constan@@ tin@@ o@@ ple itself was saved by the Is@@ au@@ rian troops of &quot; mag@@ ister milit@@ um per Orient@@ em &quot; Z@@ eno and protected by the intervention of prefect Constan@@ tin@@ us , who organized the reconstruction of the walls that had been previously damaged by earthquakes and , in some places , to construct a new line of fortification in front of the old .
an account of this invasion survives : the barb@@ arian nation of the Hun@@ s , which was in Thrace , became so great that more than a hundred cities were captured and Constan@@ tin@@ o@@ ple almost came into danger and most men fled from it . ...
and there were so many murders and blood @-@ let@@ tings that the dead could not be numbered .
A@@ y , for they took captive the churches and monasteries and slew the monks and maid@@ ens in great numbers .

<p>
in 450 , At@@ til@@ a proclaimed his intent to attack the Vi@@ si@@ go@@ th kingdom of Toul@@ ouse by making an alliance with Emperor Valen@@ tin@@ ian III .
he had previously been on good terms with the Western Roman Empire and its influential general Fla@@ vi@@ us A@@ ë@@ tius .
A@@ ë@@ tius had spent a brief exile among the Hun@@ s in 433 , and the troops that At@@ til@@ a provided against the Go@@ ths and Bag@@ aud@@ ae had helped earn him the largely honorary title of &quot; mag@@ ister milit@@ um &quot; in the west .
the gifts and diplomatic efforts of Ge@@ is@@ eric , who opposed and feared the Vi@@ si@@ go@@ ths , may also have influenced At@@ til@@ a &apos;s plans .
however , Valen@@ tin@@ ian &apos;s sister was Hon@@ oria , who had sent the Hun@@ nish king a plea for help - and her engagement ring - in order to escape her forced betrothal to a Roman senator in the spring of 450 .
Hon@@ oria may not have intended a proposal of marriage , but At@@ til@@ a chose to interpret her message as such .
he accepted , asking for half of the western Empire as dowry .
when Valen@@ tin@@ ian discovered the plan , only the influence of his mother Gall@@ a Pl@@ aci@@ dia convinced him to exile Hon@@ oria , rather than killing her .
he also wrote to At@@ til@@ a , stren@@ uously denying the legitimacy of the supposed marriage proposal .
At@@ til@@ a sent an em@@ iss@@ ary to Ra@@ ven@@ na to proclaim that Hon@@ oria was innocent , that the proposal had been legitimate , and that he would come to claim what was rightfully his .
At@@ til@@ a interfered in a succession struggle after the death of a Frank@@ ish ruler .
At@@ til@@ a supported the elder son , while A@@ ë@@ tius supported the younger .
At@@ til@@ a gathered his v@@ ass@@ als - G@@ ep@@ ids , O@@ stro@@ go@@ ths , Ru@@ gi@@ ans , Sci@@ rians , Her@@ uls , Thur@@ ing@@ ians , Al@@ ans , Bur@@ gun@@ dians , among others @-@ and began his march west .
in 451 , he arrived in Bel@@ g@@ ica with an army exaggerated by Jord@@ anes to half a million strong .
on April 7 , he captured Met@@ z .
other cities attacked can be determined by the h@@ agi@@ ographic &quot; vitae &quot; written to commemorate their bishops :
Nic@@ asi@@ us was slaughtered before the altar of his church in Rhe@@ ims ;
Serv@@ atus is alleged to have saved Tong@@ er@@ en with his prayers , as Saint Gen@@ evi@@ eve is said to have saved Paris .
lu@@ pus , bishop of Tro@@ yes , is also credited with saving his city by meeting At@@ til@@ a in person .
A@@ ë@@ tius moved to oppose At@@ til@@ a , gathering troops from among the Fran@@ ks , the Bur@@ gun@@ dians , and the Cel@@ ts .
a mission by A@@ vit@@ us and At@@ til@@ a &apos;s continued westward advance convinced the Vi@@ si@@ go@@ th king The@@ odor@@ ic I to ally with the Romans .
the combined armies reached Or@@ l@@ é@@ ans ahead of At@@ til@@ a , thus checking and turning back the Hun@@ nish advance .
A@@ ë@@ tius gave chase and caught the Hun@@ s at a place usually assumed to be near Catal@@ a@@ un@@ um .
At@@ til@@ a decided to fight the Romans on plains where he could use his cavalry .
the two armies clashed in the Battle of the Catal@@ a@@ un@@ ian Plains , the outcome of which is commonly considered to be a strategic victory for the Vi@@ si@@ go@@ thic @-@ Roman alliance .
The@@ odor@@ ic was killed in the fighting , and A@@ ë@@ tius failed to press his advantage , according to Edward Gib@@ bon and Edward C@@ reas@@ y , because he feared the consequences of an overwhelming Vi@@ si@@ go@@ thic triumph as much as he did a defeat .
from A@@ ë@@ tius &apos; point of view , the best outcome was what occurred :
The@@ odor@@ ic died , At@@ til@@ a was in retreat and disarray , and the Romans had the benefit of appearing victorious .

At@@ til@@ a returned in 452 to renew his marriage claim with Hon@@ oria , invading and rav@@ aging Italy along the way .
communities became established in what would later become Venice as a result of these attacks when the residents fled to small islands in the Venetian L@@ ago@@ on .
his army sacked numerous cities and razed Aqu@@ il@@ e@@ ia so completely that it was afterwards hard to recognize its original site .
A@@ ë@@ tius lacked the strength to offer battle , but managed to harass and slow At@@ til@@ a &apos;s advance with only a shadow force .
At@@ til@@ a finally halted at the River Po .
by this point , disease and starvation may have taken hold in At@@ til@@ a &apos;s camp , thus hindering his war efforts and potentially contributing to the cessation of invasion .
Emperor Valen@@ tin@@ ian III sent three envoys , the high civilian officers G@@ enn@@ adi@@ us Avi@@ en@@ us and Tri@@ ge@@ tius , as well as the Bishop of Rome Leo I , who met At@@ til@@ a at M@@ inci@@ o in the vicinity of Man@@ tu@@ a and obtained from him the promise that he would withdraw from Italy and negotiate peace with the Emperor .
prosper of Aqu@@ it@@ aine gives a short description of the historic meeting , but gives all the credit to Leo for the successful negotiation .
Pris@@ cus reports that superstitious fear of the fate of Alar@@ ic gave him pause - as Alar@@ ic died shortly after s@@ acking Rome in 410 .
Italy had suffered from a terrible famine in 451 and her crops were faring little better in 452 .
At@@ til@@ a &apos;s devastating invasion of the plains of northern Italy this year did not improve the harvest .
to advance on Rome would have required supplies which were not available in Italy , and taking the city would not have improved At@@ til@@ a &apos;s supply situation .
therefore , it was more profitable for At@@ til@@ a to conclude peace and retreat to his homeland .
furthermore , an East Roman force had crossed the Danube under the command of another officer also named A@@ eti@@ us - who had participated in the Council of Chal@@ ced@@ on the previous year - and proceeded to defeat the Hun@@ s who had been left behind by At@@ til@@ a to safeguard their home territories .
At@@ til@@ a , hence , faced heavy human and natural pressures to retire &quot; from Italy without ever setting foot south of the Po . &quot; as Hy@@ d@@ ati@@ us writes in his &quot; Chron@@ ica Min@@ ora &quot; :
the Hun@@ s , who had been plundering Italy and who had also stormed a number of cities , were victims of divine punishment , being visited with heaven @-@ sent disasters : famine and some kind of disease .
in addition , they were slaughtered by auxiliaries sent by the Emperor Mar@@ cian and led by A@@ eti@@ us , and at the same time , they were crushed in their &#91; home &#93; settlements ...
thus crushed , they made peace with the Romans and all returned to their homes .
</p>
<p>
Mar@@ cian was the successor of The@@ o@@ do@@ sius , and he had ceased paying tribute to the Hun@@ s in late 450 while At@@ til@@ a was occupied in the west .
multiple invasions by the Hun@@ s and others had left the Balkans with little to plunder .
after At@@ til@@ a left Italy and returned to his palace across the Danube , he planned to strike at Constan@@ tin@@ o@@ ple again and reclaim the tribute which Mar@@ cian had stopped .
however , he died in the early months of 453 .
the conventional account from Pris@@ cus says that At@@ til@@ a was at a feast celebrating his latest marriage , this time to the beautiful young Il@@ dic@@ o .
in the midst of the rev@@ els , however , he suffered a severe no@@ se@@ bleed and choked to death in a stu@@ por .
an alternative theory is that he succumbed to internal bleeding after heavy drinking , possibly a condition called esophageal var@@ ices , where dil@@ ated veins in the lower part of the esophagus rupture leading to death by hemorrhage .
another account of his death was first recorded 80 years after the events by Roman chron@@ ic@@ ler Mar@@ cell@@ in@@ us Com@@ es .
it reports that &quot; At@@ til@@ a , King of the Hun@@ s and rav@@ ager of the provinces of Europe , was pierced by the hand and blade of his wife . &quot; most scholars reject these accounts as no more than hearsay , preferring instead the account given by At@@ til@@ a &apos;s contemporary Pris@@ cus .
Pris@@ cus &apos; version , however , has recently come under renewed scrutiny by Michael A. Bab@@ cock .
based on detailed phil@@ ological analysis , Bab@@ cock concludes that the account of natural death given by Pris@@ cus was an ec@@ clesiastical &quot; cover story , &quot; and that Emperor Mar@@ cian was the political force behind At@@ til@@ a &apos;s death .
Jord@@ anes re@@ counts : on the following day , when a great part of the morning was spent , the royal attendants suspected some ill and , after a great uproar , broke in the doors .
there they found the death of At@@ til@@ a accomplished by an effusion of blood , without any wound , and the girl with down@@ cast face weeping beneath her veil .
then , as is the custom of that race , they plucked out the hair of their heads and made their faces hideous with deep wounds , that the renowned warrior might be mourned , not by eff@@ emin@@ ate w@@ ail@@ ings and tears , but by the blood of men .
moreover a wondrous thing took place in connection with At@@ til@@ a &apos;s death .
for in a dream some god stood at the side of Mar@@ cian , Emperor of the East , while he was disqui@@ eted about his fierce foe , and showed him the bow of At@@ til@@ a broken in that same night , as if to intimate that the race of Hun@@ s owed much to that weapon .
this account the historian Pris@@ cus says he accepts upon truthful evidence .
for so terrible was At@@ til@@ a thought to be to great empires that the gods announced his death to rulers as a special boon .
his body was placed in the midst of a plain and lay in state in a sil@@ ken tent as a sight for men &apos;s admiration .
the best horsemen of the entire tribe of the Hun@@ s rode around in circles , after the manner of circus games , in the place to which he had been brought and told of his deeds in a funeral dir@@ ge in the following manner :
they gave way in turn to the extremes of feeling and displayed fun@@ ereal grief alternating with joy .
then in the secrecy of night they buried his body in the earth .
they bound his coff@@ ins , the first with gold , the second with silver and the third with the strength of iron , showing by such means that these three things suited the migh@@ tiest of kings ; iron because he subdued the nations , gold and silver because he received the honors of both empires .
they also added the arms of fo@@ emen won in the fight , trap@@ pings of rare worth , sparkling with various gems , and ornaments of all sorts whereby princ@@ ely state is maintained .
and that so great riches might be kept from human curiosity , they slew those appointed to the work - a dreadful pay for their labor ; and thus sudden death was the lot of those who buried him as well as of him who was buried .
At@@ til@@ a &apos;s sons Ell@@ ac , D@@ eng@@ iz@@ ich and Er@@ n@@ ak , &quot; &quot; in their rash eagerness to rule they all alike destroyed his empire &quot; . &quot; they &quot; were clam@@ oring that the nations should be divided among them equally and that war@@ like kings with their peoples should be apportioned to them by lot like a family estate . &quot; against the treatment as &quot; slaves of the bas@@ est condition &quot; a German@@ ic alliance led by the G@@ ep@@ id ruler Ar@@ dar@@ ic revol@@ ted and fought with the Hun@@ s in P@@ ann@@ onia in the Battle of N@@ ed@@ ao 454 AD .
At@@ til@@ a &apos;s eldest son Ell@@ ac was killed in that battle .
At@@ til@@ a &apos;s sons &quot; regarding the Go@@ ths as deserters from their rule , came against them as though they were seeking fugitive slaves , &quot; attacked O@@ stro@@ go@@ thic co @-@ ruler Val@@ am@@ ir , but were repelled , and some group of Hun@@ s moved to Scy@@ thia .
his brother D@@ eng@@ iz@@ ich attempted a renewed invasion across the Danube in 468 AD , but was defeated at the Battle of B@@ assi@@ an@@ ae by the O@@ stro@@ go@@ ths .
D@@ eng@@ iz@@ ich was killed by Roman @-@ Gothic general An@@ ag@@ ast the following year , after which the Hun@@ nic dominion ended .
At@@ til@@ a &apos;s many children and relatives are known by name and some even by deeds , but soon valid geneal@@ og@@ ical sources all but dried up , and there seems to be no verifiable way to trace At@@ til@@ a &apos;s descendants .
this has not stopped many gene@@ alo@@ gists from attempting to reconstruct a valid line of descent for various medieval rulers .
one of the most credible claims has been that of the &quot; Nomin@@ alia of the Bulgarian k@@ han@@ s &quot; for myth@@ ological A@@ vit@@ o@@ hol and Ir@@ nik from the D@@ ulo clan of the Bulg@@ ars .
</p>
<p>
At@@ til@@ a himself is said to have claimed the titles &quot; Des@@ cend@@ ant of the Great Nim@@ rod , &quot; and &quot; King of the Hun@@ s , the Go@@ ths , the Danes , and the Med@@ es &quot; - the last two peoples being mentioned to show the extent of his control over subject nations even on the periph@@ eries of his domain .
Jord@@ anes embell@@ ished the report of Pris@@ cus , reporting that At@@ til@@ a had possessed the &quot; Holy War S@@ word of the Scy@@ thians , &quot; which was given to him by Mars and made him a &quot; prince of the entire world . &quot; by the end of the 12th century the royal court of Hungary proclaimed their descent from At@@ til@@ a .
Lam@@ pert of Her@@ sfeld &apos;s contemporary chron@@ icles report that shortly before the year 10@@ 71 , the S@@ word of At@@ til@@ a had been presented to Otto of Nord@@ heim by the exiled queen of Hungary , An@@ ast@@ asia of Kiev .
this sword , a cavalry sab@@ re now in the Kun@@ sth@@ ist@@ or@@ is@@ ches Museum in Vienna , appears to be the work of Hungarian gold@@ sm@@ iths of the ninth or tenth century .
an anonymous chron@@ ic@@ ler of the medieval period represented the meeting of Pope Leo and A@@ tilla as attended also by Saint Peter and Saint Paul , &quot; a miraculous tale calculated to meet the taste of the time &quot; This apo@@ the@@ osis was later portrayed artis@@ tically by the Renaissance artist Rap@@ hael and sculptor Al@@ gar@@ di , whom eighteenth @-@ century historian Edward Gib@@ bon praised for establishing &quot; one of the noblest legends of ec@@ clesiastical tradition . &quot; according to a version of this narrative related in the Chron@@ icon Pic@@ tum , a medi@@ a@@ eval Hungarian chronicle , the Pope promised At@@ til@@ a that if he left Rome in peace , one of his successors would receive a holy crown .
some histories and chron@@ icles describe him as a great and noble king , and he plays major roles in three Nor@@ se sag@@ as :
&quot; At@@ la@@ k@@ vi@@ ð@@ a &quot; , &quot; Vol@@ sun@@ ga saga &quot; , and &quot; Atl@@ am@@ á@@ l &quot; .
the &quot; Polish Chronicle &quot; represents At@@ til@@ a &apos;s name as &quot; Aquila &quot; .
Fru@@ t@@ olf of Michel@@ sberg and Otto of Fre@@ ising pointed out that some songs as &quot; vulgar f@@ ables &quot; made The@@ o@@ der@@ ic the Great , At@@ til@@ a and Er@@ man@@ ar@@ ic contemporaries , when any reader of Jord@@ anes knew that this was not the case .
this refers to the so @-@ called historical poems about Di@@ etr@@ ich von Bern , in which E@@ tz@@ el is Di@@ etr@@ ich &apos;s refuge in exile from his wicked uncle Er@@ men@@ rich .
E@@ tz@@ el is most prominent in the poems &quot; Di@@ etr@@ ich@@ s Flu@@ cht &quot; and &quot; Die Rab@@ en@@ sch@@ l@@ acht &quot; .
E@@ tz@@ el also appears as Kri@@ em@@ hil@@ d &apos;s second noble husband in the &quot; Ni@@ bel@@ un@@ gen@@ lied &quot; , in which Kri@@ em@@ hil@@ d causes the destruction of both the Hun@@ nish kingdom and that of her Bur@@ gun@@ dian relatives .
in 18@@ 12 , Lud@@ wig van Beethoven conceived the idea of writing an opera about At@@ til@@ a and approached August von Kot@@ ze@@ bu@@ e to write the lib@@ ret@@ to .
it was , however , never written .
in 18@@ 46 , Gi@@ us@@ eppe Ver@@ di wrote the opera At@@ til@@ a _ , loosely based on episodes in At@@ til@@ a &apos;s invasion of Italy .
in World War I , Allied propaganda referred to Germans as the &quot; Hun@@ s , &quot; based on a 1900 speech by Emperor Wilhelm II praising At@@ til@@ a the Hun &apos;s military prowess , according to J@@ awa@@ har@@ lal Neh@@ ru &apos;s &quot; G@@ lim@@ pses of World History &quot; . &quot;

Alfred Bern@@ hard Nobel was a Swedish chemist , engineer , inventor , businessman , and philanth@@ rop@@ ist .
known for inventing dynamite , Nobel also owned Bo@@ for@@ s , which he had redirected from its previous role as primarily an iron and steel producer to a major manufacturer of cannon and other armaments .
Nobel held 355 different patents , dynamite being the most famous .
after reading a premature ob@@ itu@@ ary which condemned him for profiting from the sales of arms , he beque@@ athed his fortune to institute the Nobel Pri@@ zes .
the synthetic element no@@ bel@@ ium was named after him .
his name also survives in modern @-@ day companies such as Dynam@@ it Nobel and Ak@@ zo@@ Nobel , which are descendants of mergers with companies Nobel himself established .
</p>
<p>
born in Stockholm , Alfred Nobel was the third son of Im@@ manuel Nobel , an inventor and engineer , and Carolina Andri@@ ette Nobel .
the couple married in 18@@ 27 and had eight children .
the family was impoverished , and only Alfred and his three brothers survived past childhood .
through his father , Alfred Nobel was a descendant of the Swedish scientist O@@ la@@ us Rud@@ beck , and in his turn the boy was interested in engineering , particularly explosives , learning the basic principles from his father at a young age .
Alfred Nobel &apos;s interest in technology was inherited from his father , an alum@@ n@@ us of Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm .
following various business failures , Nobel &apos;s father moved to Saint Petersburg in 18@@ 37 and grew successful there as a manufacturer of machine tools and explosives .
he invented veneer lathe and started work on the torpedo .
in 18@@ 42 , the family joined him in the city .
now prosperous , his parents were able to send Nobel to private tutors and the boy exc@@ elled in his studies , particularly in chemistry and languages , achieving fluency in English , French , German and Russian .
for 18 months , from 18@@ 41 to 18@@ 42 , Nobel went to the only school he ever attended as a child , the Jacobs Apo@@ logistic School in Stockholm .
as a young man , Nobel studied with chemist Nikol@@ ai Z@@ inin ; then , in 1850 , went to Paris to further the work .
there he met As@@ can@@ io Sob@@ r@@ ero , who had invented nitro@@ glycerin three years before .
Sob@@ r@@ ero strongly opposed the use of nitro@@ glycerin , as it was unpredictable , exploding when subjected to heat or pressure .
but Nobel became interested in finding a way to control and use nitro@@ glycerin as a commercially usable explosive , as it had much more power than gunpowder .
at age 18 , he went to the United States for one year to study , working for a short period under Swedish @-@ American inventor John Ericsson , who designed the American Civil War iron@@ clad &quot; US@@ S Monitor &quot; .
Nobel filed his first patent , an English patent for a gas meter , in 1857 , while his first Swedish patent , which he received in 1863 , was on &apos; ways to prepare gunpowder &apos; .
the family factory produced armaments for the Crimean War , but had difficulty switching back to regular domestic production when the fighting ended and they filed for bankruptcy .
in 1859 , Nobel &apos;s father left his factory in the care of the second son , Lud@@ vi@@ g Nobel , who greatly improved the business .
Nobel and his parents returned to Sweden from Russia and Nobel devoted himself to the study of explosives , and especially to the safe manufacture and use of nitro@@ glycerin .
Nobel invented a deton@@ ator in 1863 , and in 18@@ 65 designed the blasting cap .
on 3 September 1864 , a shed used for preparation of nitro@@ glycerin exploded at the factory in Hel@@ ene@@ borg , Stockholm , killing five people , including Nobel &apos;s younger brother Em@@ il .
dogged and un@@ fa@@ zed by more minor accidents , Nobel went on to build further factories , focusing on improving the stability of the explosives he was developing .
Nobel invented dynamite in 1867 , a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitro@@ glycerin .
Dynam@@ ite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally .
in 18@@ 75 Nobel invented gel@@ ignite , more stable and powerful than dynamite , and in 1887 patented ball@@ is@@ tite , a predecessor of cord@@ ite .
Nobel was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 18@@ 84 , the same institution that would later select laure@@ ates for two of the Nobel prizes , and he received an honorary doctorate from Up@@ psal@@ a University in 18@@ 93 .
Nobel &apos;s brothers Lud@@ vi@@ g and Robert exploited oilfields along the Caspian Sea and became hugely rich in their own right .
Nobel invested in these and amassed great wealth through the development of these new oil regions .
during his life Nobel was issued 355 patents internationally and by his death his business had established more than 90 armaments factories , despite his apparently pacif@@ ist character .
in 1888 , the death of his brother Lud@@ vi@@ g caused several newspapers to publish ob@@ itu@@ aries of Alfred in error .
one French newspaper published an ob@@ itu@@ ary titled &quot; Le mar@@ ch@@ and de la mor@@ t est mor@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; .
Nobel read the ob@@ itu@@ ary and was appalled at the idea that he would be remembered in this way .
his decision to pos@@ thum@@ ously donate the majority of his wealth to found the Nobel Prize has been credited at least in part to him wanting to leave a behind a better legacy .
</p>
<p>
accused of &quot; high treason against France &quot; for selling Ball@@ is@@ tite to Italy , Nobel moved from Paris to San@@ rem@@ o , Italy in 18@@ 91 .
on December 10 , 1896 , Alfred Nobel succumbed to a lingering heart ailment , suffered a stroke , and died .
un@@ be@@ know@@ nst to his family , friends or colleagues , he had left most of his wealth in trust , in order to fund the awards that would become known as the Nobel Pri@@ zes .
he is buried in Nor@@ ra be@@ grav@@ ning@@ s@@ plat@@ sen in Stockholm .
</p>
<p>
through baptism and confirmation Alfred Nobel was Lutheran and during his Paris years he regularly attended the Church of Sweden Abroad , led by pastor Nathan S@@ ö@@ der@@ bl@@ om , who himself received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1930 .
he became an ag@@ nostic in youth and was an athe@@ ist later in life .
Nobel travelled for much of his business life , maintaining companies in various countries in Europe and North America and keeping a permanent home in Paris from 18@@ 73 to 18@@ 91 .
he remained a solitary character , given to periods of depression .
though Nobel remained unmarried , his bi@@ ographers note that he had at least three loves .
Nobel &apos;s first love was in Russia with a girl named Alexandra , who rejected his proposal .
in 18@@ 76 Austr@@ o @-@ Bo@@ hem@@ ian Coun@@ tess Bertha Kin@@ sky became Alfred Nobel &apos;s secretary , but after only a brief stay she left him to marry her previous lover , Baron Arthur G@@ und@@ acc@@ ar von S@@ utt@@ ner .
though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief , she corresponded with him until his death in 1896 , and it is believed that she was a major influence in his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will .
as Baroness Bertha von S@@ utt@@ ner she was awarded the 1905 Nobel Peace prize , &apos; for her sincere peace activities &apos; .
Nobel &apos;s third and longest @-@ lasting relationship was with So@@ fie H@@ ess from Vienna , whom he met in 18@@ 76 .
the liaison lasted for 18 years .
after his death , according to his bi@@ ographers Ev@@ lan@@ off , Flu@@ or and F@@ ant , Nobel &apos;s letters were locked within the Nobel Institute in Stockholm .
they were released only in 1955 , to be included with other biographical data .
despite the lack of formal secondary and tertiary level education , Nobel gained proficiency in six languages : Swedish , French , Russian , English , German and Italian .
he also developed sufficient literary skill to write poetry in English .
his &quot; N@@ eme@@ sis &quot; , a prose tragedy in four acts about Beat@@ rice Cen@@ ci , partly inspired by Percy B@@ ys@@ she Shelley &apos;s &quot; The Cen@@ ci &quot; , was printed while he was dying .
the entire stock except for three copies was destroyed immediately after his death , being regarded as scandalous and blasph@@ em@@ ous .
the first surviving edition was published in Sweden in 2003 .
the play has been translated into Slovenian via the Esper@@ anto version and into French .

Nobel found that when nitro@@ glycerin was incorporated in an absorbent inert substance like &quot; ki@@ es@@ el@@ gu@@ hr &quot; it became safer and more convenient to handle , and this mixture he patented in 1867 as &quot; dynamite . &quot; Nobel demonstrated his explosive for the first time that year , at a quarry in Red@@ hill , Surrey , England .
in order to help reestablish his name and improve the image of his business from the earlier controversies associated with the dangerous explosives , Nobel had also considered naming the highly powerful substance &quot; Nobel &apos;s Safety Powder , &quot; but settled with Dynam@@ ite instead , referring to the Greek word for &quot; power &quot; .
Nobel later combined nitro@@ glycerin with various nitro@@ cellulose compounds , similar to collo@@ di@@ on , but settled on a more efficient recipe combining another nitrate explosive , and obtained a transparent , jelly @-@ like substance , which was a more powerful explosive than dynamite .
&apos;@@ Gel@@ ignite &apos; , or blasting gelatin , as it was named , was patented in 18@@ 76 ; and was followed by a host of similar combinations , modified by the addition of potassium nitrate and various other substances .
gel@@ ignite was more stable , trans@@ portable and conveniently formed to fit into bored holes , like those used in drilling and mining , than the previously used compounds and was adopted as the standard technology for mining in the &quot; Age of Engineering &quot; bringing Nobel a great amount of financial success , though at a significant cost to his health .
an off@@ shoot of this research resulted in Nobel &apos;s invention of ball@@ is@@ tite , the precursor of many modern smok@@ eless powder explosives and still used as a rocket propellant .
</p>
<p>
in 1888 Alfred &apos;s brother Lud@@ vi@@ g died while visiting Cannes and a French newspaper erroneously published Alfred &apos;s ob@@ itu@@ ary .
it condemned him for his invention of dynamite and is said to have brought about his decision to leave a better legacy after his death .
the ob@@ itu@@ ary stated , &quot; Le mar@@ ch@@ and de la mor@@ t est mor@@ t &quot; and went on to say , &quot; Dr. Alfred Nobel , who became rich by finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before , died yesterday . &quot; Alfred was disappointed with what he read and concerned with how he would be remembered .
on 27 November 18@@ 95 , at the Swedish @-@ Norwegian Club in Paris , Nobel signed his last will and testament and set aside the bulk of his estate to establish the Nobel Pri@@ zes , to be awarded annually without distinction of nationality .
after taxes and be@@ quests to individuals , Nobel &apos;s will allocated 94 % of his total assets , 3@@ 1,2@@ 25,000 Swedish kron@@ or , to establish the five Nobel Pri@@ zes .
this converted to £ 1,@@ 68@@ 7,8@@ 37 at the time .
in 2012 , the capital was worth around SEK 3.1 billion , which is almost twice the amount of the initial capital , taking inflation into account .
the first three of these prizes are awarded for eminence in physical science , in chemistry and in medical science or physiology ; the fourth is for literary work &quot; in an ideal direction &quot; and the fifth prize is to be given to the person or society that renders the greatest service to the cause of international , in the suppression or reduction of standing armies , or in the establishment or furtherance of peace congresses .
the formulation for the literary prize being given for a work &quot; in an ideal direction &quot; , is cryp@@ tic and has caused much confusion .
for many years , the Swedish Academy interpreted &quot; ideal &quot; as &quot; idealistic &quot; and used it as a reason not to give the prize to important but less romantic authors , such as Hen@@ rik Ib@@ sen and Leo Tolstoy .
this interpretation has since been revised , and the prize has been awarded to , for example , D@@ ario F@@ o and José Sar@@ am@@ ago , who do not belong to the camp of literary idealism .
there was room for interpretation by the bodies he had named for deciding on the physical sciences and chemistry prizes , given that he had not consulted them before making the will .
in his one @-@ page testament , he stipulated that the money go to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and to discoveries or improvements in chemistry .
he had opened the door to technological awards , but had not left instructions on how to deal with the distinction between science and technology .
since the deciding bodies he had chosen were more concerned with the former , the prizes went to scientists more often than engineers , technicians or other inventors .
in 2001 , Alfred Nobel &apos;s great @-@ great @-@ nephew , Peter Nobel , asked the Bank of Sweden to differentiate its award to economists given &quot; in Alfred Nobel &apos;s memory &quot; from the five other awards .
this request added to the controversy over whether the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel is actually a legitimate &quot; Nobel Prize . &quot;

the &quot; Monument to Alfred Nobel &quot; in Saint Petersburg is located along the Bol@@ sha@@ ya Nev@@ ka River on Petro@@ gra@@ d@@ skaya Em@@ bank@@ ment .
it was dedicated in 1991 to mark the 90th anniversary of the first Nobel Prize presentation .
diplomat Thomas Ber@@ tel@@ man and Professor Ark@@ ady Mel@@ ua initiators of creation of the monument .
professor A. Mel@@ ua has provided funds for the establishment of the monument .
the abstract metal sculpture was designed by local artists Sergey Ali@@ po@@ v and Pavel Shevchenko , and appears to be an explosion or branches of a tree .
Petro@@ gra@@ d@@ skaya Em@@ bank@@ ment is the street where the Nobel &apos;s family lived until 1859 .

criticism of Nobel focuses on his leading role in weapons manufacturing and sales , and some question his motives in creating his prizes , suggesting they were intended to improve his reputation .

Bell made a number of inventions as a formal British citizen after im@@ migrating to Canada and then moving to the United States , including the telephone in 18@@ 76 ; however , he did not become an American citizen until 1882 .
therefore , if nationality is to be described specifically ...
Alexander Graham Bell , British inventor of the telephone , died as an American citizen in Canada .
the wording in the lead paragraph was carefully crafted after input from many editors to accommodate the many diverse claims .
it is recognized that in the last years of his life , Bell had American citizenship , although he lived primarily in Canada on his estate .
his life &apos;s work and details on his nationality and citizenship are provided in later sections .
he also founded the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 18@@ 85 .
Bell &apos;s father , grandfather , and brother had all been associated with work on el@@ oc@@ ution and speech and both his mother and wife were deaf , profoundly influencing Bell &apos;s life &apos;s work .
his research on hearing and speech further led him to experiment with hearing devices which eventually culminated in Bell being awarded the first U.S. patent for the telephone in 18@@ 76 .
Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study .
many other inventions marked Bell &apos;s later life , including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications , hydro@@ fo@@ ils , and aeronau@@ tics .
although Bell was not one of the 33 founders of the National Geographic Society , he had a strong influence on the magazine while serving as the second president from January 7 , 1898 , until 1903 .

Alexander Bell was born in Edinburgh , Scotland , on March 3 , 18@@ 47 .
the family home was at South Charlotte Street , and has a stone inscription marking it as Alexander Graham Bell &apos;s birthplace .
he had two brothers : Mel@@ ville James Bell and Edward Charles Bell , both of whom would die of tuberculosis .
his father was Professor Alexander Mel@@ ville Bell , a phone@@ tici@@ an , and his mother was Eliza Grace .
born as just &quot; Alexander Bell , &quot; at age 10 , he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers .
for his 11th birthday , his father acquies@@ ced and allowed him to adopt the name &quot; Graham , &quot; chosen out of respect for Alexander Graham , a Canadian being treated by his father who had become a family friend .
to close relatives and friends he remained &quot; Al@@ eck . &quot;

as a child , young Bell displayed a natural curiosity about his world , resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age .
his best friend was Ben Her@@ d@@ man , a neighbour whose family operated a flour mill , the scene of many for@@ ays .
young Bell asked what needed to be done at the mill .
he was told wheat had to be de@@ hus@@ ked through a laborious process and at the age of 12 , Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating padd@@ les with sets of nail brushes , creating a simple de@@ hus@@ king machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years .
in return , Ben &apos;s father John Her@@ d@@ man gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to &quot; invent . &quot; from his early years , Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art , poetry , and music that was encouraged by his mother .
with no formal training , he mastered the piano and became the family &apos;s pianist .
despite being normally quiet and intro@@ spective , he revel@@ led in mim@@ ic@@ ry and &quot; voice tricks &quot; akin to ven@@ tril@@ oqu@@ ism that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits .
Bell was also deeply affected by his mother &apos;s gradual deafness , and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour .
he also developed a technique of speaking in clear , modulated tones directly into his mother &apos;s forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity .
Bell &apos;s preoccupation with his mother &apos;s deafness led him to study acoustics .
his family was long associated with the teaching of el@@ oc@@ ution : his grandfather , Alexander Bell , in London , his uncle in Dublin , and his father , in Edinburgh , were all el@@ oc@@ u@@ tionists .
his father published a variety of works on the subject , several of which are still well known , especially his &quot; The Standard E@@ loc@@ u@@ tionist &quot; , which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868 . &quot;
the Standard E@@ loc@@ u@@ tionist &quot; appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone .
in this treatise , his father explains his methods of how to instruct deaf @-@ mu@@ tes to articulate words and read other people &apos;s lip movements to decipher meaning .
Bell &apos;s father taught him and his brothers not only to write Vi@@ sible Speech but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound .
Bell became so proficient that he became a part of his father &apos;s public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities .
he could decipher Vi@@ sible Speech representing virtually every language , including Latin , Scottish Ga@@ elic , and even S@@ ans@@ k@@ rit , accurately re@@ citing written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation .
</p>
<p>
as a young child , Bell , like his brothers , received his early schooling at home from his father .
at an early age , he was enrolled at the Royal High School , Edinburgh , Scotland , which he left at the age of 15 , having completed only the first four forms .
his school record was un@@ distinguished , marked by absenteeism and lack@@ lustre grades .
his main interest remained in the sciences , especially biology while he treated other school subjects with indifference , to the dismay of his demanding father .
upon leaving school , Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather , Alexander Bell .
during the year he spent with his grandfather , a love of learning was born , with long hours spent in serious discussion and study .
the elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction , the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself .
at the age of 16 , Bell secured a position as a &quot; pupil @-@ teacher &quot; of el@@ oc@@ ution and music , in West@@ on House Academy at El@@ gin , Mor@@ ay , Scotland .
although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek , he instructed classes himself in return for board and £ 10 per session .
the following year , he attended the University of Edinburgh ; joining his older brother Mel@@ ville who had enrolled there the previous year .
in 1868 , not long before he departed for Canada with his family , Bell completed his mat@@ ric@@ ulation exams and was accepted for admission to University College London .
</p>
<p>
his father encouraged Bell &apos;s interest in speech and , in 1863 , took his sons to see a unique autom@@ aton developed by Sir Charles Whe@@ at@@ stone based on the earlier work of Baron Wolfgang von K@@ emp@@ el@@ en .
the rudimentary &quot; mechanical man &quot; simulated a human voice .
Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von K@@ emp@@ el@@ en &apos;s book , published in German , and had labor@@ iously translated it , he and his older brother Mel@@ ville built their own autom@@ aton head .
their father , highly interested in their project , offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the entic@@ ement of a &quot; big prize &quot; if they were successful .
while his brother constructed the throat and laryn@@ x , Bell tackled the more difficult task of recre@@ ating a realistic skull .
his efforts resulted in a remarkably lifel@@ ike head that could &quot; speak , &quot; albeit only a few words .
the boys would carefully adjust the &quot; lips &quot; and when a bel@@ lows forced air through the wind@@ pipe , a very recognizable &quot; Mama &quot; ensued , to the delight of neighbours who came to see the Bell invention .
at age 19 , Bell wrote a report on his work and sent it to phil@@ ologist Alexander Ellis , a colleague of his father .
Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany , and also lent Bell a copy of Her@@ mann von Hel@@ m@@ hol@@ tz &apos;s work , &quot; The S@@ ens@@ ations of T@@ one as a Physi@@ ological Basis for the Theory of Music &quot; .
dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Hel@@ m@@ hol@@ tz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork &quot; contra@@ ption , &quot; Bell por@@ ed over the German scientist &apos;s book .
working from his own erroneous mistr@@ ans@@ lation of a French edition , Bell for@@ tu@@ itously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound , reporting :
&quot; without knowing much about the subject , it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means , so could conson@@ ants , so could articulate speech . &quot; he also later remarked :
&quot; I thought that Hel@@ m@@ hol@@ tz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity . it was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days , I might never have commenced my experiments ! &quot;
</p>
<p>
in 18@@ 65 , when the Bell family moved to London , Bell returned to West@@ on House as an assistant master and , in his spare hours , continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment .
Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a telegraph wire from his room in Som@@ er@@ set College to that of a friend .
throughout late 1867 , his health faltered mainly through exhaustion .
his younger brother , Edward &quot; Ted , &quot; was similarly bed @-@ ridden , suffering from tuberculosis .
while Bell recovered and served the next year as an instructor at Som@@ er@@ set College , Bath , England , his brother &apos;s condition deteriorated .
Edward would never recover .
upon his brother &apos;s death , Bell returned home in 1867 .
his older brother Mel@@ ville had married and moved out .
with aspirations to obtain a degree at University College London , Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations , devoting his spare time at his family &apos;s residence to studying .
helping his father in Vi@@ sible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Sus@@ anna E. H@@ ull &apos;s private school for the deaf in South K@@ ens@@ ington , London .
his first two pupils were deaf @-@ mute girls who made remarkable progress under his tutel@@ age .
while his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own el@@ oc@@ ution school , applying for a patent on an invention , and starting a family , Bell continued as a teacher .
however , in May 1870 , Mel@@ ville died from complications due to tuberculosis , causing a family crisis .
his father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a conval@@ escence in Newfoundland .
Bell &apos;s parents embarked upon a long @-@ planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly .
acting decisively , Alexander Mel@@ ville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property , conclude all of his brother &apos;s affairs , and join his father and mother in setting out for the &quot; New World . &quot; reluctantly , Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Ec@@ cl@@ eston , who , as he had sur@@ mis@@ ed , was not prepared to leave England with him .
</p>
<p>
in 1870 , aged 23 , Bell , together with Bell &apos;s brother &apos;s widow , Caroline Margaret Ot@@ ta@@ way , and his parents travelled on the SS &quot; Nest@@ orian &quot; to Canada .
after landing at Quebec City , the B@@ ells transferred to another steamer to Montreal and then boarded a train to Paris , Ontario , to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson , a family friend .
after a brief stay with the Hen@@ der@@ sons , the Bell family purchased a farm of at Tut@@ elo Heights , near Bran@@ t@@ ford , Ontario .
the property consisted of an orchard , large farmhouse , stable , pig@@ sty , hen @-@ house , and a carriage house , which bordered the Grand River .
at the homeste@@ ad , Bell set up his own workshop in the converted carriage house near to what he called his &quot; dreaming place , &quot; a large hollow nestled in trees at the back of the property above the river .
despite his frail condition upon arriving in Canada , Bell found the climate and environs to his liking , and rapidly improved .
he continued his interest in the study of the human voice and when he discovered the Six Nations Reserve across the river at O@@ non@@ d@@ aga , he learned the Mo@@ hawk language and translated its unwritten vocabulary into Vi@@ sible Speech symbols .
for his work , Bell was awarded the title of Honorary Chief and participated in a ceremony where he donn@@ ed a Mo@@ hawk he@@ address and danced traditional dances .
after setting up his workshop , Bell continued experiments based on Hel@@ m@@ hol@@ tz &apos;s work with electricity and sound .
he also modified a melo@@ de@@ on so that it could transmit its music electrically over a distance .
once the family was settled in , both Bell and his father made plans to establish a teaching practice and in 18@@ 71 , he accompanied his father to Montreal , where Mel@@ ville was offered a position to teach his System of Vi@@ sible Speech .
</p>
<p>
Bell &apos;s father was invited by Sarah Fuller , principal of the Boston School for Deaf M@@ utes , in Boston , Massachusetts , United States , to introduce the Vi@@ sible Speech System by providing training for Fuller &apos;s instructors , but he declined the post in favour of his son .
travelling to Boston in April 18@@ 71 , Bell proved successful in training the school &apos;s instructors .
he was subsequently asked to repeat the programme at the American Asylum for Deaf @-@ mu@@ tes in Hart@@ ford , Connecticut , and the Clarke School for the Deaf in North@@ ampton , Massachusetts .
returning home to Bran@@ t@@ ford after six months abroad , Bell continued his experiments with his &quot; harmonic telegraph . &quot; the basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch , but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed .
unsure of his future , he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies , but decided to return to Boston as a teacher .
his father helped him set up his private practice by contacting Gar@@ diner Gre@@ ene Hub@@ bard , the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation .
teaching his father &apos;s system , in October 1872 , Alexander Bell opened his &quot; School of V@@ ocal Physi@@ ology and Mechanics of Speech &quot; in Boston , which attracted a large number of deaf pupils , with his first class numbering 30 students .
while he was working as a private tutor , one of his pupils was Helen Keller , who came to him as a young child unable to see , hear , or speak .
she was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that &quot; inhuman silence which separates and estr@@ anges . &quot; in 18@@ 93 , Keller performed the so@@ d @-@ breaking ceremony for the construction of Bell &apos;s new Vol@@ ta Bureau , dedicated to &quot; the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf . &quot; several influential people of the time , including Bell , viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated , and also believed that with resources and effort , they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of sign language , thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded .
owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language , Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing Deaf culture .
</p>
<p>
in the following year , Bell became professor of V@@ ocal Physi@@ ology and E@@ loc@@ ution at the Boston University School of Or@@ atory .
during this period , he altern@@ ated between Boston and Bran@@ t@@ ford , spending summers in his Canadian home .
at Boston University , Bell was &quot; swept up &quot; by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city .
he continued his research in sound and endeav@@ ored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech , but although absorbed by his experiments , he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation .
while days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes , Bell began to stay awake late into the night , running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house .
keeping &quot; night owl &quot; hours , he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment .
Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover .
worse still , his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches .
returning to Boston in fall 18@@ 73 , Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound .
deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice , Bell retained only two students , six @-@ year @-@ old &quot; Georgi@@ e &quot; Sanders , deaf from birth , and 15 @-@ year @-@ old Mab@@ el Hub@@ bard .
each pupil would play an important role in the next developments .
George &apos;s father , Thomas Sanders , a wealthy businessman , offered Bell a place to stay in nearby Salem with Georgi@@ e &apos;s grandmother , complete with a room to &quot; experiment . &quot; although the offer was made by George &apos;s mother and followed the year @-@ long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell &apos;s boarding house , it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal .
the arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together , with free room and board thrown in .
Mab@@ el was a bright , attractive girl who was ten years Bell &apos;s junior but became the object of his affection .
having lost her hearing after a near @-@ fatal bout of scarlet fever close to her fifth birthday , she had learned to read lips but her father , Gar@@ diner Gre@@ ene Hub@@ bard , Bell &apos;s benefactor and personal friend , wanted her to work directly with her teacher .
</p>
<p>
although there remain disputes between various parties that were eventually resolved in litigation , this still remains a contentious issue .
while working that summer in Bran@@ t@@ ford , Bell experimented with a &quot; phon@@ autograph , &quot; a pen @-@ like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations .
Bell thought it might be possible to generate und@@ ulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves .
Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the und@@ ulating currents back into sound .
but he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas .
in 1874 , telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of Western Union President William Or@@ ton , had become &quot; the nervous system of commerce . &quot; Antonio Me@@ uc@@ ci sent a telephone model and technical details to the Western Union telegraph company but failed to win a meeting with executives .
when he asked for his materials to be returned , in 1874 , he was told they had been lost .
two years later Bell , who shared a laboratory with Me@@ uc@@ ci , filed a patent for a telephone , became a celebrity and made a lucrative deal with Western Union .
Me@@ uc@@ ci sued and was nearing victory - the supreme court agreed to hear the case and fraud charges were initiated against Bell - when the Flor@@ entine died in 1889 .
the legal action died with him .
Or@@ ton had contracted with inventors Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines .
when Bell mentioned to Gar@@ diner Hub@@ bard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi @-@ reed device , the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell &apos;s experiments .
patent matters would be handled by Hub@@ bard &apos;s patent attorney , Anthony Pol@@ lo@@ k .
in March 18@@ 75 , Bell and Pol@@ lo@@ k visited the scientist Joseph Henry , who was then director of the Smith@@ son@@ ian Institution , and asked Henry &apos;s advice on the electrical multi @-@ reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph .
Henry replied that Bell had &quot; the germ of a great invention . &quot; when Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge , Henry replied , &quot; Get it ! &quot; that declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying , even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments , nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas .
however , a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and Thomas A. Watson , an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams , changed all that .
with financial support from Sanders and Hub@@ bard , Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant , and the two of them experimented with acoustic telegraph@@ y .
on June 2 , 18@@ 75 , Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell , at the receiving end of the wire , heard the over@@ tones of the reed ; over@@ tones that would be necessary for transmitting speech .
that demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or ar@@ mature was necessary , not multiple reeds .
this led to the &quot; g@@ allows &quot; sound @-@ powered telephone , which could transmit in@@ distinct , voice @-@ like sounds , but not clear speech .
</p>
<p>
in 18@@ 75 , Bell developed an acoustic telegraph and drew up a patent application for it .
since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors Gar@@ diner Hub@@ bard and Thomas Sanders , Bell requested that an associate in Ontario , George Brown , attempt to patent it in Britain , instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain .
meanwhile , Elisha Gray was also experimenting with acoustic telegraph@@ y and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter .
on February 14 , 18@@ 76 , Gray filed a caveat with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter .
that same morning , Bell &apos;s lawyer filed Bell &apos;s application with the patent office .
there is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell &apos;s patent .
Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26 .
Bell &apos;s patent 17@@ 4,@@ 465 , was issued to Bell on March 7 , 18@@ 76 , by the U.S. Patent Office .
Bell &apos;s patent covered &quot; the method of , and apparatus for , transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraph@@ ically ... by causing electrical und@@ ulations , similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound &quot; Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work , drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray &apos;s patent caveat .
on March 10 , 18@@ 76 , three days after his patent was issued , Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work , using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray &apos;s design .
vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water , varying the electrical resistance in the circuit .
when Bell spoke the sentence &quot; Mr. Watson - Come here - I want to see you &quot; into the liquid transmitter , Watson , listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room , heard the words clearly .
although Bell was , and still is , accused of stealing the telephone from Gray , Bell used Gray &apos;s water transmitter design only after Bell &apos;s patent had been granted , and only as a proof of concept scientific experiment , to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible &quot; articulate speech &quot; could be electrically transmitted .
after March 18@@ 76 , Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray &apos;s liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use .
the question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell &apos;s patent application .
he told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray &apos;s caveat .
Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell &apos;s previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury , not water .
Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25 , 18@@ 75 , long before Elisha Gray described the water device .
in addition , Gray abandoned his caveat , and because he did not contest Bell &apos;s priority , the examiner approved Bell &apos;s patent on March 3 , 18@@ 76 .
Gray had rein@@ vented the variable resistance telephone , but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone .
the patent examiner , Z@@ enas F@@ isk Wil@@ ber , later stated in an affidavit that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell &apos;s lawyer , Mar@@ cell@@ us Bailey , with whom he had served in the Civil War .
he claimed he showed Gray &apos;s patent caveat to Bailey .
Wil@@ ber also claimed that he showed Gray &apos;s caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $ 100 .
Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms , although in a letter to Gray , Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details .
Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave Wil@@ ber any money .
</p>
<p>
continuing his experiments in Bran@@ t@@ ford , Bell brought home a working model of his telephone .
on August 3 , 18@@ 76 , from the telegraph office in Mount Ple@@ asant five miles away from Bran@@ t@@ ford , Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready .
with curious onloo@@ kers packed into the office as witnesses , faint voices were heard replying .
the following night , he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Bran@@ t@@ ford , four miles distant , along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences , and laid through a tunnel .
this time , guests at the household distinctly heard people in Bran@@ t@@ ford reading and singing .
these experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances .
Bell and his partners , Hub@@ bard and Sanders , offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $ 100,000 .
the president of Western Union bal@@ ked , countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy .
two years later , he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $ 25 million he would consider it a bargain .
by then , the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent .
Bell &apos;s investors would become millionaires while he fared well from resi@@ duals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars .
Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the scientific community as well as the general public .
a short time later , his demonstration of an early telephone prototype at the 18@@ 76 Cent@@ ennial Ex@@ position in Philadelphia brought the telephone to international attention .
influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor Pedro II of Brazil .
later , Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to Sir William Thomson , a renowned Scottish scientist , as well as to Queen Victoria , who had requested a private audience at Osborne House , her Isle of W@@ ight home .
she called the demonstration &quot; most extraordinary . &quot; the enthusiasm surrounding Bell &apos;s public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device .
the Bell Telephone Company was created in 18@@ 77 , and by 18@@ 86 , more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones .
Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone , which emerged as one of the most successful products ever .
in 18@@ 79 , the Bell company acquired Edison &apos;s patents for the carbon microphone from Western Union .
this made the telephone practical for longer distances , and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone .
Emperor Pedro II of Brazil was the first person to buy stock in Bell &apos;s company , the Bell Telephone Company .
one of the first telephones in a private residence was installed in his palace in Petr@@ ó@@ polis , his summer retreat forty miles from Rio de Janeiro .
in January 1915 , Bell made the first ceremonial trans@@ continental telephone call .
calling from the AT &amp; T head office at 15 De@@ y Street in New York City , Bell was heard by Thomas Watson at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco .
the &quot; New York Times &quot; reported : on October 9 , 18@@ 76 , Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson talked by telephone to each other over a two @-@ mile wire stretched between Cambridge and Boston .
it was the first wire conversation ever held .
yesterday afternoon &#91; on January 25 , 1915 &#93; , the same two men talked by telephone to each other over a 3,400 @-@ mile wire between New York and San Francisco .
Dr. Bell , the veteran inventor of the telephone , was in New York , and Mr. Watson , his former associate , was on the other side of the continent .
</p>
<p>
as is sometimes common in scientific discoveries , simultaneous developments can occur , as evidenced by a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone .
over a period of 18 years , the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents , including five that went to the U.S. Supreme Court , but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage .
Bell &apos;s laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments .
the Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and Amos Dol@@ bear .
in personal correspondence to Bell , both Gray and Dol@@ bear had acknowledged his prior work , which considerably weakened their later claims .
on January 13 , 1887 , the U.S. Government moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of fraud and misrepresentation .
after a series of decisions and reversals , the Bell company won a decision in the Supreme Court , though a couple of the original claims from the lower court cases were left undecided .
by the time that the trial wound its way through nine years of legal battles , the U.S. prosecuting attorney had died and the two Bell patents were no longer in effect , although the presiding judges agreed to continue the proceedings due to the case &apos;s importance as a precedent .
with a change in administration and charges of conflict of interest arising from the original trial , the US Attorney General dropped the lawsuit on November 30 , 18@@ 97 , leaving several issues undecided on the merits .
during a deposition filed for the 1887 trial , Italian inventor Antonio Me@@ uc@@ ci also claimed to have created the first working model of a telephone in Italy in 18@@ 34 .
in 18@@ 86 , in the first of three cases in which he was involved , Me@@ uc@@ ci took the stand as a witness in the hopes of establishing his invention &apos;s priority .
Me@@ uc@@ ci &apos;s testimony in this case was disputed due to a lack of material evidence for his inventions , as his working models were purportedly lost at the laboratory of American District Telegraph of New York , which was later incorporated as a subsidiary of Western Union in 1901 .
Me@@ uc@@ ci &apos;s work , like many other inventors of the period , was based on earlier acoustic principles and despite evidence of earlier experiments , the final case involving Me@@ uc@@ ci was eventually dropped upon Me@@ uc@@ ci &apos;s death .
however , due to the efforts of Congressman Vi@@ to Fos@@ sel@@ la , the U.S. House of Representatives on June 11 , 2002 , stated that Me@@ uc@@ ci &apos;s &quot; work in the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged . &quot; this did not put an end to the still @-@ contentious issue .
some modern scholars do not agree with the claims that Bell &apos;s work on the telephone was influenced by Me@@ uc@@ ci &apos;s inventions .
the value of the Bell patent was acknowledged throughout the world , and patent applications were made in most major countries , but when Bell delayed the German patent application , the electrical firm of Siemens &amp; Hal@@ s@@ ke set up a rival manufacturer of Bell telephones under their own patent .
the Siemens company produced near @-@ identical copies of the Bell telephone without having to pay royalties .
the establishment of the International Bell Telephone Company in Brussels , Belgium in 1880 , as well as a series of agreements in other countries eventually consolidated a global telephone operation .
the strain put on Bell by his constant appearances in court , necessitated by the legal battles , eventually resulted in his resignation from the company .
</p>
<p>
on July 11 , 18@@ 77 , a few days after the Bell Telephone Company was established , Bell married Mab@@ el Hub@@ bard at the Hub@@ bard estate in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
his wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1,4@@ 87 of his 1,4@@ 97 shares in the newly formed Bell Telephone Company .
shortly thereafter , the newly@@ weds embarked on a year @-@ long honeymoon in Europe .
during that excursion , Bell took a handmade model of his telephone with him , making it a &quot; working holiday . &quot; the courtship had begun years earlier ; however , Bell waited until he was more financially secure before marrying .
although the telephone appeared to be an &quot; instant &quot; success , it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell &apos;s main sources of income were from lectures until after 18@@ 97 .
one unusual request ex@@ acted by his fianc@@ ée was that he use &quot; Al@@ ec &quot; rather than the family &apos;s earlier familiar name of &quot; Al@@ eck . &quot; from 18@@ 76 , he would sign his name &quot; Al@@ ec Bell . &quot; they had four children :
the Bell family home was in Cambridge , Massachusetts , until 1880 when Bell &apos;s father @-@ in @-@ law bought a house in Washington , D.C. ; in 1882 he bought a home in the same city for Bell &apos;s family , so they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes .
Bell was a British subject throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882 when he became a naturalized citizen of the United States .
in 1915 , he characterized his status as : &quot; I am not one of those hy@@ phen@@ ated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries . &quot; despite this declaration , Bell has been proudly claimed as a &quot; native son &quot; by all three countries he resided in : the United States , Canada , and the United Kingdom .
by 18@@ 85 , a new summer retreat was contemplated .
that summer , the B@@ ells had a vacation on Cape Bret@@ on Island in Nova Scotia , spending time at the small village of Bad@@ deck .
returning in 18@@ 86 , Bell started building an estate on a point across from Bad@@ deck , overlooking Br@@ as d &apos;@@ Or Lake .
by 1889 , a large house , christ@@ ened &quot; The Lo@@ dge &quot; was completed and two years later , a larger complex of buildings , including a new laboratory , were begun that the B@@ ells would name Be@@ inn Bh@@ re@@ agh after Bell &apos;s ancestral Scottish highlands .
Bell also built the Bell Bo@@ at@@ yard on the estate , employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime life@@ boats and work@@ boats for the Royal Canadian Navy and pleasure craft for the Bell family .
he was an enthusiastic bo@@ ater , and Bell and his family sailed or rowed a long series of vessels on Br@@ as d &apos;@@ Or Lake , ordering additional vessels from the H.@@ W. Emb@@ ree and Sons boat@@ yard in Port Haw@@ kes@@ bury , Nova Scotia .
in his final , and some of his most productive years , Bell split his residency between Washington , D.C. , where he and his family initially resided for most of the year , and Be@@ inn Bh@@ re@@ agh , where they spent increasing amounts of time .
until the end of his life , Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes , but &quot; Be@@ inn Bh@@ re@@ agh &quot; would , over the next 30 years , become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays length@@ ened .
both Mab@@ el and Bell became immersed in the Bad@@ deck community and were accepted by the villagers as &quot; their own . &quot; the B@@ ells were still in residence at &quot; Be@@ inn Bh@@ re@@ agh &quot; when the Halifax Explo@@ sion occurred on December 6 , 1917 .
Mab@@ el and Bell mobilized the community to help victims in Halifax .

although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone , his interests were extremely varied .
according to one of his bi@@ ographers , Charlotte Gray , Bell &apos;s work ranged &quot; unfettered across the scientific landscape &quot; and he often went to bed vor@@ aciously reading the &quot; En@@ cycl@@ op@@ æ@@ dia Brit@@ ann@@ ica &quot; , scouring it for new areas of interest .
the range of Bell &apos;s inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators .
these included 14 for the telephone and telegraph , four for the phot@@ ophone , one for the phon@@ ograph , five for aerial vehicles , four for &quot; hydro@@ airplanes , &quot; and two for selenium cells .
Bell &apos;s inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing , the audi@@ ometer to detect minor hearing problems , a device to locate ice@@ bergs , investigations on how to separate salt from seawater , and work on finding alternative fuels .
Bell worked extensively in medical research and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf .
during his Vol@@ ta Laboratory period , Bell and his associates considered im@@ pressing a magnetic field on a record as a means of reproducing sound .
although the trio briefly experimented with the concept , they could not develop a workable prototype .
they abandoned the idea , never realizing they had glim@@ p@@ sed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the tape recorder , the hard disc and floppy disc drive , and other magnetic media .
Bell &apos;s own home used a primitive form of air conditioning , in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice .
he also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution .
methane gas , he reasoned , could be produced from the waste of farms and factories .
at his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia , he experimented with composting toilets and devices to capture water from the atmosphere .
in a magazine interview published shortly before his death , he reflected on the possibility of using solar panels to heat houses .
</p>
<p>
Bell and his assistant Charles Sum@@ ner T@@ ain@@ ter jointly invented a wireless telephone , named a phot@@ ophone , which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of light .
both men later became full associates in the Vol@@ ta Laboratory Association .
on June 21 , 1880 , Bell &apos;s assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance , from the roof of the Franklin School in Washington , D.C. , to Bell at the window of his laboratory , some away , 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions .
Bell believed the phot@@ ophone &apos;s principles were his life &apos;s &quot; greatest achievement , &quot; telling a reporter shortly before his death that the phot@@ ophone was &quot; the greatest invention &#91; I have &#93; ever made , greater than the telephone . &quot; the phot@@ ophone was a precursor to the fiber @-@ optic communication systems which achieved popular worldwide usage in the 1980s .
its master patent was issued in December 1880 , many decades before the phot@@ ophone &apos;s principles came into popular use .
</p>
<p>
Bell is also credited with developing one of the early versions of a metal detector in 18@@ 81 .
the device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President James Garfield .
according to some accounts , the metal detector worked f@@ law@@ lessly in tests but did not find the assassin &apos;s bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument , resulting in static .
the president &apos;s surgeons , who were skeptical of the device , ignored Bell &apos;s requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs .
alternatively , although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test , the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus .
Bell &apos;s own detailed account , presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1882 , differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation , by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet .
</p>
<p>
the March 1906 &quot; Scientific American &quot; article by American pioneer William E. Me@@ ac@@ ham explained the basic principle of hydro@@ fo@@ ils and hydro@@ planes .
Bell considered the invention of the hydro@@ plane as a very significant achievement .
based on information gained from that article , he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydro@@ foil boat .
Bell and assistant Frederick W .
&quot; Casey &quot; Bal@@ d@@ win began hydro@@ foil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water .
Bal@@ d@@ win studied the work of the Italian inventor En@@ ric@@ o For@@ lan@@ ini and began testing models .
this led him and Bell to the development of practical hydro@@ foil wat@@ erc@@ raft .
during his world tour of 1910 @-@ 11 , Bell and Bal@@ d@@ win met with For@@ lan@@ ini in France .
they had rides in the For@@ lan@@ ini hydro@@ foil boat over Lake Mag@@ gi@@ ore .
Bal@@ d@@ win described it as being as smooth as flying .
on returning to Bad@@ deck , a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models , including the &quot; D@@ h@@ onn@@ as Be@@ ag &quot; , the first self @-@ propelled Bell @-@ Bal@@ d@@ win hydro@@ foil .
the experimental boats were essentially proof @-@ of @-@ concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD @-@ 4 , powered by Renault engines .
a top speed of was achieved , with the hydro@@ foil exhibiting rapid acceleration , good stability , and steering , along with the ability to take waves without difficulty .
in 19@@ 13 , Dr. Bell hired Walter Pin@@ aud , a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pin@@ aud &apos;s Y@@ acht Y@@ ard in West@@ mount , Nova Scotia to work on the pon@@ to@@ ons of the HD @-@ 4 .
Pin@@ aud soon took over the boat@@ yard at Bell Laboratories on Be@@ inn Bh@@ re@@ agh , Bell &apos;s estate near Bad@@ deck , Nova Scotia .
Pin@@ aud &apos;s experience in boat @-@ building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD @-@ 4 .
after the First World War , work began again on the HD @-@ 4 .
Bell &apos;s report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two engines in July 1919 .
on September 9 , 1919 , the HD @-@ 4 set a world marine speed record of , a record which stood for ten years .

in 18@@ 91 , Bell had begun experiments to develop motor @-@ powered heavier @-@ than @-@ air aircraft .
the A@@ EA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife , who advised him to seek &quot; young &quot; help as Bell was at the age of 60 .
in 1898 , Bell experimented with tetra@@ hedr@@ al box kites and wings constructed of multiple compound tetra@@ hedr@@ al kites covered in mar@@ oon silk .
the tetra@@ hedr@@ al wings were named &quot; Cy@@ g@@ net &quot; I , II , and III , and were flown both unmanned and manned in the period from 1907 @-@ 1912 .
some of Bell &apos;s kites are on display at the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site .
Bell was a supporter of aerospace engineering research through the A@@ erial Experiment Association , officially formed at Bad@@ deck , Nova Scotia , in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife Mab@@ el and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate .
the A@@ EA was headed by Bell and the founding members were four young men :
American Glenn H. Cur@@ ti@@ ss , a motorcycle manufacturer at the time and who held the title &quot; world &apos;s fastest man , &quot; having ridden his self @-@ constructed motor bicycle around in the shortest time , and who was later awarded the Scientific American Tro@@ phy for the first official one @-@ kilometre flight in the Western hemisphere , and who later became a world @-@ renowned airplane manufacturer ;
lieutenant Thomas Sel@@ fridge , an official observer from the U.S. Federal government and one of the few people in the army who believed that aviation was the future ;
Frederick W. Bal@@ d@@ win , the first Canadian and first British subject to pilot a public flight in Ham@@ mon@@ d@@ sport , New York ; and J. A .@@ D. Mc@@ Cur@@ dy @-@ Bal@@ d@@ win and Mc@@ Cur@@ dy being new engineering graduates from the University of Toronto .
the A@@ EA &apos;s work progressed to heavier @-@ than @-@ air machines , applying their knowledge of kites to gli@@ ders .
moving to Ham@@ mon@@ d@@ sport , the group then designed and built the &quot; Red Wing &quot; , framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air @-@ cooled engine .
on March 12 , 1908 , over K@@ eu@@ ka Lake , the bi@@ plane lifted off on the first public flight in North America .
the innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder .
one of the A@@ EA &apos;s inventions , a practical wing@@ tip form of the ail@@ eron , was to become a standard component on all aircraft .
the &quot; White Wing &quot; and &quot; June Bu@@ g &quot; were to follow and by the end of 1908 , over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished .
however , the A@@ EA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $ 15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with experiments .
Lt. Sel@@ fridge had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier @-@ than @-@ air flight in a crash of the Wright Fl@@ yer at Fort M@@ yer , Virginia , on September 17 , 1908 .
their final aircraft design , the &quot; Silver D@@ art &quot; , embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines .
on February 23 , 19@@ 09 , Bell was present as the &quot; Silver D@@ art &quot; flown by J. A. D. Mc@@ Cur@@ dy from the frozen ice of Br@@ as d &apos;@@ Or made the first aircraft flight in Canada .
Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand .
with the successful flight , the A@@ EA disbanded and the &quot; Silver D@@ art &quot; would revert to Bal@@ d@@ win and Mc@@ Cur@@ dy , who began the Canadian Aero@@ drome Company and would later demonstrate the aircraft to the Canadian Army .
</p>
<p>
Bell was connected with the eu@@ gen@@ ics movement in the United States .
in his lecture &quot; M@@ emo@@ ir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race &quot; presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13 , 18@@ 83 , he noted that congen@@ it@@ ally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry .
however , it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist David Star@@ r Jordan &apos;s Committee on Eugen@@ ics , under the auspices of the American Bre@@ eders &apos; Association .
the committee unequivocally extended the principle to humans .
from 1912 until 1918 , he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugen@@ ics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York , and regularly attended meetings .
in 1921 , he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugen@@ ics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York .
organizations such as these advocated passing laws that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be , as Bell called them , a &quot; defective variety of the human race . &quot; by the late 1930s , about half the states in the U.S. had eu@@ gen@@ ics laws , and California &apos;s compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany .
</p>
<p>
honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew .
Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities to the point that the requests almost became burdensome .
during his life , he also received dozens of major awards , medals , and other tributes .
these included statu@@ ary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created , including the Bell Telephone Memorial erected in his honor in &quot; Alexander Graham Bell Gardens &quot; in Bran@@ t@@ ford , Ontario , in 1917 .
a large number of Bell &apos;s writings , personal correspondence , notebooks , papers , and other documents reside in both the United States Library of Congress Man@@ us@@ cript Division , and at the Alexander Graham Bell Institute , Cape Bret@@ on University , Nova Scotia ; major portions of which are available for online viewing .
a number of historic sites and other marks commemorate Bell in North America and Europe , including the first telephone companies in the United States and Canada .
among the major sites are : in 1880 , Bell received the Vol@@ ta Prize with a purse of 50,000 French francs for the invention of the telephone from the French government .
among the lumin@@ aries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dum@@ as , &quot; fil@@ s &quot; .
the Vol@@ ta Prize was conceived by Napoleon III in 18@@ 52 , and named in honor of Al@@ ess@@ andro Vol@@ ta , with Bell becoming the second recipient of the grand prize in its history .
since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent , he used his prize money to create endowment funds and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington , D.@@ C ..
these included the prestigious &quot; &apos; Vol@@ ta Laboratory Association &apos; &quot; , also known as the &quot; Vol@@ ta Laboratory &quot; and as the &quot; &apos; Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory &apos; , &quot; and which eventually led to the Vol@@ ta Bureau as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown , Washington , D.C. The Vol@@ ta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery , and the very next year it improved Edison &apos;s phon@@ ograph by substituting wax for tin@@ foil as the recording medium and inc@@ ising the recording rather than ind@@ enting it , key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted .
the laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his &quot; prou@@ dest achievement , &quot; &quot; the phot@@ ophone , &quot; the &quot; optical telephone &quot; which pres@@ aged fibre optical telecommunications while the Vol@@ ta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing , a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness .
in partnership with Gar@@ diner Gre@@ ene Hub@@ bard , Bell helped establish the publication &quot; Science &quot; during the early 18@@ 80s .
in 1898 , Bell was elected as the second president of the National Geographic Society , serving until 1903 , and was primarily responsible for the extensive use of illustrations , including photography , in the magazine .
he also served for many years as a Regent of the Smith@@ son@@ ian Institution .
the French government conferred on him the decoration of the Lé@@ gi@@ on d &apos;@@ hon@@ ne@@ ur ; the Royal Society of Arts in London awarded him the Albert Medal in 19@@ 02 ; the University of W@@ ür@@ z@@ burg , Bav@@ aria , granted him a PhD , and he was awarded the Franklin Institute &apos;s Elli@@ ott C@@ res@@ son Medal in 1912 .
he was one of the founders of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in 18@@ 84 and served as its president from 18@@ 91 @-@ 92 .
Bell was later awarded the AI@@ EE &apos;s Edison Medal in 1914 &quot; For meritorious achievement in the invention of the telephone . &quot; the &quot; bel &quot; and the smaller &quot; deci@@ bel &quot; are units of measurement of power level invented by Bell Lab@@ s and named after him .
since 1976 , the I@@ EEE &apos;s Alexander Graham Bell Medal has been awarded to honor outstanding contributions in the field of telecommunications .
in 1936 , the US Patent Office declared Bell first on its list of the country &apos;s greatest inventors , leading to the US Post Office issuing a commemorative stamp honoring Bell in 1940 as part of its &apos; Fam@@ ous Americans Series &apos; .
the First Day of Issue ceremony was held on October 28 in Boston , Massachusetts , the city where Bell spent considerable time on research and working with the deaf .
the Bell stamp became very popular and sold out in little time .
the stamp became , and remains to this day , the most valuable one of the series .
the 15@@ 0th anniversary of Bell &apos;s birth in 1997 was marked by a special issue of commemorative £ 1 banknotes from the Royal Bank of Scotland .
the illustrations on the reverse of the note include Bell &apos;s face in profile , his signature , and objects from Bell &apos;s life and career : users of the telephone over the ages ; an audio wave signal ; a diagram of a telephone receiver ; geometric shapes from engineering structures ; representations of sign language and the phonetic alphabet ; the geese which helped him to understand flight ; and the sheep which he studied to understand genetics .
additionally , the Government of Canada honored Bell in 1997 with a C $ 100 gold coin , in tribute also to the 15@@ 0th anniversary of his birth , and with a silver dollar coin in 2009 in honor of the 100th anniversary of flight in Canada .
that first flight was made by an airplane designed under Dr. Bell &apos;s tutel@@ age , named the Silver D@@ art .
Bell &apos;s image , and also those of his many inventions have graced paper money , co@@ inage , and postal stamps in numerous countries worldwide for many dozens of years .
Alexander Graham Bell was ranked 57th among the 100 Great@@ est Britons in an official BBC nationwide poll , and among the Top Ten Great@@ est Canadians , and the 100 Great@@ est Americans .
in 2006 , Bell was also named as one of the 10 greatest Scottish scientists in history after having been listed in the National Library of Scotland &apos;s &apos; Scottish Science Hall of F@@ ame &apos; .
Bell &apos;s name is still widely known and used as part of the names of dozens of educational institutes , corporate names@@ akes , street and place names around the world .

Bell died of complications arising from diabetes on August 2 , 1922 , at his private estate in Cape Bret@@ on , Nova Scotia , at age 75 .
Bell had also been afflicted with pernicious anemia .
his last view of the land he had inhabited was by moonlight on his mountain estate at 2 : 00 a.@@ m .
while tending to him after his long illness , Mab@@ el , his wife , whispered , &quot; Don &apos;t leave me . &quot; by way of reply , Bell signed &quot; no ... , &quot; lost consciousness , and died shortly after .
on learning of Bell &apos;s death , the Canadian Prime Minister , Mack@@ enz@@ ie King , c@@ abled Mrs. Bell , saying :
my colleagues in the Government join with me in expressing to you our sense of the world &apos;s loss in the death of your distinguished husband .
it will ever be a source of pride to our country that the great invention , with which his name is im@@ mort@@ ally associated , is a part of its history .
on the behalf of the citizens of Canada , may I extend to you an expression of our combined gratitude and sympathy .
Bell &apos;s coffin was constructed of Be@@ inn Bh@@ re@@ agh pine by his laboratory staff , lined with the same red silk fabric used in his tetra@@ hedr@@ al kite experiments .
to help celebrate his life , his wife asked guests not to wear black while attending his service , during which sol@@ oist Jean Mac@@ Donald sang a verse of Robert Louis Stevenson &apos;s &quot; Requi@@ em &quot; : : under a wide and starry sky , : dig the grave and let me lie . : glad did I live and gladly die : and I laid me down with a will .
upon the conclusion of Bell &apos;s funeral , &quot; every phone on the continent of North America was silenced in honor of the man who had given to mankind the means for direct communication at a distance . &quot; Dr. Alexander Graham Bell was buried atop Be@@ inn Bh@@ re@@ agh mountain , on his estate where he had resided increasingly for the last 35 years of his life , overlooking Br@@ as d &apos;@@ Or Lake .
he was survived by his wife Mab@@ el , his two daughters , El@@ sie May and M@@ arian , and nine of his grandchildren .

Andy War@@ hol was an American artist , director and producer who was a leading figure in the visual art movement known as pop art .
his works explore the relationship between artistic expression , celebrity culture , and advertising that flourished by the 1960s , and span a variety of media , including painting , silk@@ screening , photography , film , and sculpture .
some of his best known works include the silk@@ screen paintings &quot; Campbell &apos;s Sou@@ p C@@ ans &quot; and &quot; Marilyn Di@@ p@@ ty@@ ch &quot; , the experimental film &quot; Chelsea Girls &quot; , and the multimedia events known as the &quot; Explo@@ ding Plastic In@@ ev@@ itable &quot; .
born and raised in Pittsburgh , War@@ hol initially pursued a successful career as a commercial illustr@@ ator .
after exhibiting his work in several galleries in the late 1950s , he began to receive recognition as an influential and controversial artist .
his New York studio , The Factory , became a well @-@ known gathering place that brought together distinguished intellectuals , drag queens , play@@ w@@ rights , Bo@@ hem@@ ian street people , Hollywood celebrities , and wealthy patrons .
he promoted a collection of personalities known as War@@ hol super@@ stars , and is credited with co@@ ining the widely used expression &quot; 15 minutes of fame . &quot; in the late 1960s , he managed and produced the experimental rock band The Vel@@ vet Underground and founded &quot; Interview &quot; magazine .
he authored numerous books , including &quot; The Philosophy of Andy War@@ hol &quot; and &quot; &quot; .
he lived openly as a gay man before the gay liberation movement .
after gallbladder surgery , War@@ hol died of cardiac arrhyth@@ mia in February 1987 at the age of 58 .
War@@ hol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions , books , and feature and documentary films .
the Andy War@@ hol Museum in his native city of Pittsburgh , which holds an extensive permanent collection of art and archives , is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist .
many of his creations are very collectible and highly valuable .
the highest price ever paid for a War@@ hol painting is US $ 105 million for a 1963 canvas titled &quot; Silver Car Cra@@ sh &quot; ; his works include some of the most expensive paintings ever sold .
a 2009 article in &quot; The Economist &quot; described War@@ hol as the &quot; bell@@ wether of the art market . &quot;
</p>
<p>
War@@ hol was born on August 6 , 1928 , in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
he was the fourth child of On@@ dre@@ j War@@ hol@@ a and Julia , whose first child was born in their homeland and died before their move to the U.S. His parents were working @-@ class Lem@@ ko emigrants from Mik@@ ó , Austria @-@ Hungary .
War@@ hol &apos;s father emigrated to the United States in 1914 , and his mother joined him in 1921 , after the death of War@@ hol &apos;s grandparents .
War@@ hol &apos;s father worked in a coal mine .
the family lived at 55 Be@@ el@@ en Street and later at 3@@ 252 Dawson Street in the Oak@@ land neighborhood of Pittsburgh .
the family was Ru@@ then@@ ian Catholic and attended St. John Chr@@ y@@ so@@ st@@ om Byzantine Catholic Church .
Andy War@@ hol had two older brothers - P@@ avo@@ l , the oldest , was born before the family emigrated ; J@@ án was born in Pittsburgh .
P@@ avo@@ l &apos;s son , James War@@ hol@@ a , became a successful children &apos;s book illustr@@ ator .
in third grade , War@@ hol had Sy@@ den@@ ham &apos;s chor@@ ea , the nervous system disease that causes involuntary movements of the extremities , which is believed to be a complication of scarlet fever which causes skin pig@@ mentation bl@@ ot@@ ch@@ iness .
at times when he was confined to bed , he drew , listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around his bed .
War@@ hol later described this period as very important in the development of his personality , skill @-@ set and preferences .
when War@@ hol was 13 , his father died in an accident .
as a teenager , War@@ hol graduated from Sch@@ en@@ ley High School in 1945 .
also as a teen , War@@ hol won a Schol@@ astic Art and Writing Award .
after graduating from high school , his intentions were to study art education at the University of Pittsburgh in the hope of becoming an art teacher , but his plans changed and he enrolled in the Carnegie Institute of Technology , now Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , where he studied commercial art .
during his time there , War@@ hol joined the campus Modern Dance Club and Be@@ aux Arts Society .
he also served as art director of the student art magazine , &quot; Can@@ o &quot; , illustrating a cover in 1948 and a full @-@ page interior illustration in 1949 .
these are believed to be his first two published art@@ works .
War@@ hol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in pictorial design in 1949 .
later that year , he moved to New York City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising .
</p>
<p>
War@@ hol &apos;s early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising art , where his first commission had been to draw shoes for &quot; G@@ lam@@ our &quot; magazine in the late 1940s .
in the 1950s , War@@ hol worked as a designer for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller .
Ben@@ stock , Shari and Suzanne Fer@@ riss . &quot;
footnotes : on Sho@@ es &quot; ; Rut@@ gers University Press ; February 1 , 2001 ; ; pp. 44 @-@ 48 .
American photographer John Co@@ plans recalled that nobody drew shoes the way Andy did .
he somehow gave each shoe a temperament of its own , a sort of sly , Toul@@ ouse @-@ L@@ aut@@ rec kind of sophistication , but the shape and the style came through accurately and the buckle was always in the right place .
the kids in the apartment &#91; which Andy shared in New York - note by Co@@ plans &#93; noticed that the v@@ amps on Andy &apos;s shoe drawings kept getting longer and longer but &#91; Israel &#93; Miller didn &apos;t mind .
War@@ hol &apos;s &quot; whim@@ s@@ ical &quot; ink drawings of shoe advertisements figured in some of his earliest show@@ ings at the Bod@@ ley Gallery in New York .
War@@ hol was an early adop@@ ter of the silk screen print@@ making process as a technique for making paintings .
a young War@@ hol was taught silk screen print@@ making techniques by Max Arthur Co@@ hn at his graphic arts business in Manhattan .
while working in the shoe industry , War@@ hol developed his &quot; bl@@ otted line &quot; technique , applying ink to paper and then bl@@ otting the ink while still wet , which was akin to a print@@ making process on the most rudimentary scale .
his use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image and also to create endless variations on the theme , a method that pre@@ figures his 1960s silk @-@ screen canvas .
in his book &quot; &quot; , War@@ hol writes : &quot; when you do something exactly wrong , you always turn up something . &quot; War@@ hol habitually used the expedient of tracing photographs projected with an ep@@ idi@@ as@@ cope .
using prints by Edward W@@ allow@@ itch , his &apos; first boyfriend &apos; the photographs would undergo a subtle transformation during War@@ hol &apos;s often cursory tracing of contours and hat@@ ching of shadows .
War@@ hol used W@@ allow@@ itch &apos;s photograph &quot; Young Man Smoking a C@@ ig@@ a@@ rette &quot; , for a 1958 design for a book cover he submitted to Simon and Sch@@ uster for the Walter Ross pulp novel &quot; The Im@@ mortal &quot; , and later used others for his dollar bill series , and for &quot; Big Campbell &apos;s Sou@@ p Can with Can Open@@ er &quot; , of 1962 which initiated War@@ hol &apos;s most sustained motif , the soup can .
with the rapid expansion of the record industry , R@@ CA Records hired War@@ hol , along with another freelance artist , Sid Maur@@ er , to design album covers and promotional materials .
</p>
<p>
he began exhibiting his work during the 1950s .
he held exhibitions at the Hugo Gallery and the Bod@@ ley Gallery in New York City ; in California , his first West Coast gallery exhibition was on July 9 , 1962 , in the Fer@@ us Gallery of Los Angeles with Campbell &apos;s Sou@@ p C@@ ans .
the exhibition marked his West Coast debut of pop art .
Andy War@@ hol &apos;s first New York solo pop art exhibition was hosted at Eleanor Ward &apos;s Stable Gallery November 6 @-@ 24 , 1962 .
the exhibit included the works &quot; Marilyn Di@@ p@@ ty@@ ch &quot; , &quot; 100 Sou@@ p C@@ ans &quot; , &quot; 100 Coke Bot@@ tles &quot; , and &quot; 100 Dollar Bills &quot; .
at the Stable Gallery exhibit , the artist met for the first time poet John Gior@@ no who would star in War@@ hol &apos;s first film , &quot; Sleep &quot; , in 1963 .
it was during the 1960s that War@@ hol began to make paintings of iconic American objects such as dollar bills , mushroom clouds , electric chairs , Campbell &apos;s Sou@@ p C@@ ans , Coca @-@ Cola bottles , celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe , Elvis Pres@@ ley , Mar@@ lon Bran@@ do , Troy Don@@ ah@@ ue , Muhammad Ali , and Elizabeth Taylor , as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police dogs attacking African @-@ American protesters during the Birmingham campaign in the civil rights movement .
during these years , he founded his studio , &quot; The Factory &quot; and gathered about him a wide range of artists , writers , musicians , and underground celebrities .
his work became popular and controversial .
War@@ hol had this to say about Coca @-@ Cola : what &apos;s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest .
you can be watching TV and see Coca @-@ Cola , and you know that the President drinks Coca @-@ Cola , Liz Taylor drinks Coca @-@ Cola , and just think , you can drink Coca @-@ Cola , too .
a Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking .
all the Co@@ kes are the same and all the Co@@ kes are good .
Liz Taylor knows it , the President knows it , the bum knows it , and you know it .
new York City &apos;s Museum of Modern Art hosted a Symposium on pop art in December 1962 during which artists such as War@@ hol were attacked for &quot; capit@@ ulating &quot; to consumerism .
critics were scand@@ alized by War@@ hol &apos;s open embrace of market culture .
this symposium set the tone for War@@ hol &apos;s reception .
a pivotal event was the 1964 exhibit &quot; The American Super@@ market &quot; , a show held in Paul Bi@@ anch@@ ini &apos;s Upper East Side gallery .
the show was presented as a typical U.S. small supermarket environment , except that everything in it - from the produce , canned goods , meat , posters on the wall , etc . - was created by six prominent pop artists of the time , among them the controversial Billy Apple , Mary In@@ man , and Robert Watts .
War@@ hol &apos;s painting of a can of Campbell &apos;s soup cost $ 1,500 while each auto@@ graph@@ ed can sold for $ 6 .
the exhibit was one of the first mass events that directly confronted the general public with both pop art and the perennial question of what art is .
as an advertisement illustr@@ ator in the 1950s , War@@ hol used assistants to increase his productivity .
collaboration would remain a defining aspect of his working methods throughout his career ; this was particularly true in the 1960s .
one of the most important collaborators during this period was Gerard Mal@@ anga .
Mal@@ anga assisted the artist with the production of silk@@ screens , films , sculpture , and other works at &quot; The Factory , &quot; War@@ hol &apos;s aluminum foil @-@ and @-@ silver @-@ paint @-@ lined studio on 47th Street .
other members of War@@ hol &apos;s Factory crowd included Freddie Her@@ ko , On@@ dine , Ronald Tav@@ el , Mary Wor@@ on@@ ov , Billy Name , and Brig@@ id Berlin .
during the 1960s , War@@ hol also gro@@ omed a retin@@ ue of bo@@ hem@@ ian and counter@@ culture eccentr@@ ics upon whom he bestowed the designation &quot; Super@@ stars , &quot; including N@@ ico , Joe D@@ all@@ es@@ andro , E@@ die Sed@@ g@@ wick , Vi@@ va , Ul@@ tra Viol@@ et , Holly Wood@@ lawn , Jackie Curtis , and Can@@ dy Darling .
these people all participated in the Factory films , and some - like Berlin - remained friends with War@@ hol until his death .
important figures in the New York underground art / cinema world , such as writer John Gior@@ no and film @-@ maker Jack Smith , also appear in War@@ hol films of the 1960s , revealing War@@ hol &apos;s connections to a diverse range of artistic scenes during this time .
less well known was his support and collaboration with several teen @-@ agers during this era , who would achieve prominence later in life including writer David Dal@@ ton , photographer Stephen S@@ hore and artist Bi@@ b@@ be Hansen .

on June 3 , 1968 , radical feminist writer Valerie Sol@@ anas shot War@@ hol and Mario Ama@@ ya , art critic and curator , at War@@ hol &apos;s studio .
before the shooting , Sol@@ anas had been a marginal figure in the Factory scene .
she authored in 1967 the &quot; S.@@ C.@@ U.@@ M. Manif@@ esto &quot; , a separatist feminist tract that advocated the elimination of men ; and appeared in the 1968 War@@ hol film &quot; I , a Man &quot; .
earlier on the day of the attack , Sol@@ anas had been turned away from the Factory after asking for the return of a script she had given to War@@ hol .
the script had apparently been misplaced .
Ama@@ ya received only minor injuries and was released from the hospital later the same day .
War@@ hol was seriously wounded by the attack and barely survived : Sur@@ geons opened his chest and mass@@ aged his heart to help stimulate its movement again .
he suffered physical effects for the rest of his life , including being required to wear a surgical cor@@ set .
the shooting had a profound effect on War@@ hol &apos;s life and art .
Sol@@ anas was arrested the day after the assault , after turning herself in to police .
by way of explanation , she said that War@@ hol &quot; had too much control over my life . &quot; she was subsequently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and eventually sentenced to three years under the control of the Department of Corrections .
after the shooting , the Factory scene heavily increased security , and for many the &quot; Factory 60s &quot; ended .

<p>
compared to the success and scandal of War@@ hol &apos;s work in the 1960s , the 1970s were a much quieter decade , as he became more entrepreneurial .
according to Bob Col@@ ac@@ ello , War@@ hol devoted much of his time to rounding up new , rich patrons for portrait commissions - including Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , his wife Em@@ press Farah P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , his sister Princess Ashraf P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi , M@@ ick Jag@@ ger , L@@ iza Min@@ n@@ elli , John Len@@ non , Diana Ross , and Brig@@ itte Bar@@ dot .
War@@ hol &apos;s famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong was created in 1973 .
he also founded , with Gerard Mal@@ anga , &quot; Interview &quot; magazine , and published &quot; The Philosophy of Andy War@@ hol &quot; .
an idea expressed in the book : &quot; making money is art , and working is art and good business is the best art . &quot; War@@ hol socialized at various night@@ spots in New York City , including Max &apos;s Kansas City ; and , later in the 1970s , Studio 54 .
he was generally regarded as quiet , shy , and a meticulous observer .
art critic Robert Hughes called him &quot; the white mole of Union Square . &quot; in 1979 , along with his longtime friend Stuart P@@ iv@@ ar , War@@ hol founded the New York Academy of Art .
</p>
<p>
War@@ hol had a re @-@ emergence of critical and financial success in the 1980s , partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a number of prolific younger artists , who were dominating the &quot; bull market &quot; of 1980s New York art :
Jean @-@ Michel Bas@@ qui@@ at , Julian Sch@@ nab@@ el , David S@@ alle and other so @-@ called Neo @-@ Ex@@ pres@@ sion@@ ists , as well as members of the Trans@@ av@@ ant@@ garde movement in Europe , including Francesco Cle@@ ment@@ e and En@@ zo C@@ uc@@ chi .
before the 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics , he teamed with 15 other artists , including David H@@ ock@@ ney and C@@ y Tw@@ om@@ bly , and contributed a Speed Sk@@ ater print to the Art and Sport collection .
the Speed Sk@@ ater was used for the official Sarajevo Winter Olympics poster .
by this time , graffiti artist F@@ ab Five Fred@@ dy paid homage to War@@ hol when he painted an entire train with Campbell soup cans .
this was instrumental in Fred@@ dy becoming involved in the underground NYC art scene and becoming an affiliate of Bas@@ qui@@ at .
by this period , War@@ hol was being criticized for becoming merely a &quot; business artist . &quot; in 1979 , reviewers disliked his exhibits of portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities , calling them superficial , fac@@ ile and commercial , with no depth or indication of the significance of the subjects .
they also criticized his 1980 exhibit of 10 portraits at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan , entitled &quot; Jewish Gen@@ i@@ uses &quot; , which War@@ hol - who was un@@ interested in Judaism and Jews - had described in his diary as &quot; They &apos;re going to sell . &quot; in hindsight , however , some critics have come to view War@@ hol &apos;s super@@ fici@@ ality and commerci@@ ality as &quot; the most brilliant mirror of our times , &quot; contending that &quot; War@@ hol had captured something irresistible about the ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist of American culture in the 1970s . &quot; War@@ hol also had an appreciation for intense Hollywood glamour .
he once said : &quot; I love Los Angeles . I love Hollywood . they &apos;re so beautiful . everything &apos;s plastic , but I love plastic . I want to be plastic . &quot; in 1984 , War@@ hol im@@ mort@@ alized the singer Prince by creating one of his final portraits , &quot; Orange Prince &quot; , a commission from V@@ anity Fair to accompany an article to celebrate the success of Prince &apos;s album and movie entitled &quot; Purple Rain &quot; .
referencing the many celebrity portraits produced by War@@ hol across his career , &quot; Orange &quot; &quot; Prince &quot; was created using a similar composition to the Marilyn &quot; F@@ lav@@ ors &quot; series from 1962 , among some of War@@ hol &apos;s very first celebrity portraits .
Prince is depicted in a pop color palette commonly used by War@@ hol , in bright orange with highlights of bright green and blue .
the facial features and hair are screen @-@ printed in black over the orange background .
in the &quot; Andy War@@ hol Di@@ aries &quot; , War@@ hol recorded how excited he was to see Prince and Billy Idol together at a party in the mid 1980s , and he compared them to the Hollywood movie stars of the 1950s and 1960s who also inspired his portraits :
... &quot; seeing these two glamour boys , its like &quot; boys &quot; are the new Hollywood glamour girls , like Jean Har@@ low and Marilyn Monroe . &quot;
</p>
<p>
by the beginning of the 1960s , pop art was an experimental form that several artists were independently adopting ; some of these pioneers , such as Roy L@@ ich@@ tenstein , would later become synonymous with the movement .
War@@ hol , who would become famous as the &quot; Pope of Pop , &quot; turned to this new style , where popular subjects could be part of the artist &apos;s palette .
his early paintings show images taken from cartoons and advertisements , hand @-@ painted with paint dri@@ ps .
Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that War@@ hol had done and it was very popular .
those dri@@ ps emulated the style of successful abstract expres@@ sion@@ ists .
War@@ hol &apos;s first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961 , serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bron@@ wit T@@ eller &apos;s window display .
this was the same stage his Pop Art contemporaries Jas@@ per Johns , James Rosen@@ qu@@ ist and Robert R@@ aus@@ ch@@ enberg had also once graced .
it was the gall@@ er@@ ist Mu@@ riel Lat@@ ow who came up with the ideas for both the soup cans and War@@ hol &apos;s dollar paintings .
on November 23 , 1961 , War@@ hol wrote Lat@@ ow a check for $ 50 which , according to the 2009 War@@ hol biography , &quot; Pop , The Gen@@ ius of War@@ hol &quot; , was payment for coming up with the idea of the soup cans as subject matter .
for his first major exhibition , War@@ hol painted his famous cans of Campbell &apos;s soup , which he claimed to have had for lunch for most of his life .
a 1964 &quot; Large Campbell &apos;s Sou@@ p Can &quot; was sold in a 2007 So@@ the@@ by &apos;s auction to a South American collector for £ 5.1 million .
he loved celebrities , so he painted them as well .
from these beginnings he developed his later style and subjects .
instead of working on a signature subject matter , as he started out to do , he worked more and more on a signature style , slowly eliminating the handmade from the artistic process .
War@@ hol frequently used silk @-@ screening ; his later drawings were traced from slide projections .
at the height of his fame as a painter , War@@ hol had several assistants who produced his silk @-@ screen multi@@ ples , following his directions to make different versions and variations .
in 1979 , War@@ hol was commissioned by BMW to paint a Group @-@ 4 race version of the then &quot; elite super@@ car &quot; BMW M@@ 1 for the fourth installment in the BMW Art Car Project .
it was reported at the time that , unlike the three artists before him , War@@ hol opted to paint directly onto the automobile himself instead of letting technicians transfer his scale @-@ model design to the car .
it was indicated that War@@ hol spent only a total of 23 minutes to paint the entire car .
War@@ hol produced both comic and serious works ; his subject could be a soup can or an electric chair .
War@@ hol used the same techniques - silk@@ screens , reproduced seri@@ ally , and often painted with bright colors - whether he painted celebrities , everyday objects , or images of suicide , car crashes , and disasters , as in the 1962 @-@ 63 &quot; Death and Disaster &quot; series .
the &quot; Death and Disaster &quot; paintings included &quot; Red Car Cra@@ sh &quot; , &quot; Purple Jum@@ ping Man &quot; , and &quot; Orange Disaster . &quot; one of these paintings , the di@@ p@@ ty@@ ch &quot; Silver Car Cra@@ sh &quot; , became the highest priced work of his when it sold at So@@ the@@ by &apos;s Contemporary Art Au@@ ction on Wednesday , November 13 , 2013 , for $ 10@@ 5.4 million .
some of War@@ hol &apos;s work , as well as his own personality , has been described as being Ke@@ at@@ ones@@ que .
War@@ hol has been described as playing dumb to the media .
he sometimes refused to explain his work .
he has suggested that all one needs to know about his work is &quot; already there &apos; on the surface &apos; . &quot; his R@@ or@@ sch@@ ach ink@@ bl@@ ots are intended as pop comments on art and what art could be .
his cow wallpaper and his oxidation paintings are also noteworthy in this context .
equally noteworthy is the way these works - and their means of production - mirrored the atmosphere at Andy &apos;s New York &quot; Factory . &quot; bi@@ ographer Bob Col@@ ac@@ ello provides some details on Andy &apos;s &quot; piss paintings &quot; :
Victor ... was Andy &apos;s ghost p@@ iss@@ er on the Ox@@ id@@ ations .
he would come to the Factory to urin@@ ate on canv@@ ases that had already been pri@@ med with copper @-@ based paint by Andy or R@@ onnie C@@ utr@@ one , a second ghost p@@ iss@@ er much appreciated by Andy , who said that the vitamin B that R@@ onnie took made a pret@@ tier color when the acid in the urine turned the copper green .
did Andy ever use his own urine ?
my diary shows that when he first began the series , in December 1977 , he did , and there were many others : boys who &apos;d come to lunch and drink too much wine , and find it funny or even flattering to be asked to help Andy &apos; paint &apos; .
Andy always had a little extra bounce in his walk as he led them to his studio .
War@@ hol &apos;s first portrait of &quot; Bas@@ qui@@ at &quot; is a black photo @-@ silk@@ screen over an oxidized copper &quot; piss painting . &quot; after many years of silk@@ screen , oxidation , photography , etc . , War@@ hol returned to painting with a brush in hand in a series of more than 50 large collaborative works done with Jean @-@ Michel Bas@@ qui@@ at between 1984 and 1986 .
despite negative criticism when these were first shown , War@@ hol called some of them &quot; masterpieces , &quot; and they were influential for his later work .
Andy War@@ hol was commissioned in 1984 by collector and gall@@ er@@ ist Alexander I@@ ol@@ as to produce work based on Leonardo da Vinci &apos;s &quot; The Last Sup@@ per &quot; for an exhibition at the old ref@@ ec@@ tory of the Pal@@ az@@ zo del@@ le St@@ ell@@ ine in Milan , opposite from the Santa Maria del@@ le Gra@@ zie where Leonardo da Vinci &apos;s mural can be seen .
War@@ hol exceeded the demands of the commission and produced nearly 100 variations on the theme , mostly silk@@ screens and paintings , and among them a collaborative sculpture with Bas@@ qui@@ at , the &quot; Ten Pun@@ ching Bag@@ s &quot; .
the Milan exhibition that opened in January 1987 with a set of 22 silk @-@ screens , was the last exhibition for both the artist and the gall@@ er@@ ist .
the series of &quot; The Last Sup@@ per &quot; was seen by some as &quot; arguably his greatest , &quot; but by others as &quot; wish@@ y @-@ wash@@ y , religi@@ ose &quot; and &quot; spirit@@ less . &quot; it is the largest series of religious @-@ themed works by any U.S. artist .
artist Mauri@@ z@@ io C@@ att@@ el@@ an describes that it is difficult to separate daily encounters from the art of Andy War@@ hol :
&quot; that &apos;s probably the greatest thing about War@@ hol : the way he penetrated and summarized our world , to the point that distinguishing between him and our everyday life is basically impossible , and in any case useless . &quot; War@@ hol was an inspiration towards C@@ att@@ el@@ an &apos;s magazine and photography compilations , such as &quot; Permanent Food , Char@@ ley &quot; , and &quot; To@@ il@@ et Paper &quot; .
in the period just before his death , War@@ hol was working on &quot; Cars &quot; , a series of paintings for Mercedes @-@ Benz .
a self @-@ portrait by Andy War@@ hol , which sold in New York at the May Post @-@ War and Contemporary evening sale in Christie &apos;s , fetched $ 38@@ .4 million .
on May 9 , 2012 , his classic painting &quot; Double Elvis &quot; sold at auction at So@@ the@@ by &apos;s in New York for US $ 33 million .
with commission , the sale price totaled US $ 37@@ ,0@@ 4@@ 2,500 , short of the $ 50 million that So@@ the@@ by &apos;s had predicted the painting might bring .
the piece shows Elvis Pres@@ ley in a gun@@ sl@@ inger pose .
it was first exhibited in 1963 at the Fer@@ us Gallery in Los Angeles .
War@@ hol made 22 versions of the &quot; Double Elvis &quot; , nine of which are held in museums .
in November 2013 , his &quot; Silver Car Cra@@ sh &quot; di@@ p@@ ty@@ ch sold at So@@ the@@ by &apos;s Contemporary Art Au@@ ction for $ 10@@ 5.4 million , a new record for the pop artist .
created in 1963 , this work had rarely been seen in public in the previous years .
in November 2014 , &quot; Tri@@ ple Elvis &quot; sold for $ 81.@@ 9@@ m at an auction in New York .
</p>
<p>
War@@ hol worked across a wide range of media - painting , photography , drawing , and sculpture .
in addition , he was a highly prolific film@@ maker .
between 1963 and 1968 , he made more than 60 films , plus some 500 short black @-@ and @-@ white &quot; screen test &quot; portraits of Factory visitors .
one of his most famous films , &quot; Sleep &quot; , monitors poet John Gior@@ no sleeping for six hours .
the 35 @-@ minute film &quot; B@@ low Job &quot; is one continuous shot of the face of De@@ Ver@@ en Book@@ wal@@ ter supposedly receiving oral sex from film@@ maker Will@@ ard Ma@@ as , although the camera never til@@ ts down to see this .
another , &quot; Empire &quot; , consists of eight hours of footage of the Empire State Building in New York City at dusk .
the film &quot; Eat &quot; consists of a man eating a mushroom for 45 minutes .
War@@ hol attended the 1962 premiere of the static composition by La@@ Monte Young called &quot; Tri@@ o for Str@@ ings &quot; and subsequently created his famous series of static films including &quot; K@@ iss &quot; , &quot; Eat &quot; , and &quot; Sleep &quot; .
U@@ we Hus@@ sle@@ in cites film@@ maker Jonas Mek@@ as , who accompanied War@@ hol to the Tri@@ o premiere , and who claims War@@ hol &apos;s static films were directly inspired by the performance . &quot;
Batman Drac@@ ula &quot; is a 1964 film that was produced and directed by War@@ hol , without the permission of DC Com@@ ics .
it was screened only at his art exhibits .
a fan of the &quot; Batman &quot; series , War@@ hol &apos;s movie was an &quot; homage &quot; to the series , and is considered the first appearance of a blatantly cam@@ py Batman .
the film was until recently thought to have been lost , until scenes from the picture were shown at some length in the 2006 documentary &quot; Jack Smith and the Destruction of Atlantis &quot; .
War@@ hol &apos;s 1965 film &quot; Vin@@ yl &quot; is an adaptation of Anthony Burg@@ ess &apos; popular dy@@ stop@@ ian novel &quot; A C@@ lock@@ work Orange &quot; .
others record improvised encounters between Factory regul@@ ars such as Brig@@ id Berlin , Vi@@ va , E@@ die Sed@@ g@@ wick , Can@@ dy Darling , Holly Wood@@ lawn , On@@ dine , N@@ ico , and Jackie Curtis .
legendary underground artist Jack Smith appears in the film &quot; Camp &quot; .
his most popular and critically successful film was &quot; Chelsea Girls &quot; .
the film was highly innovative in that it consisted of two 16 mm @-@ films being projected simultaneously , with two different stories being shown in tandem .
from the projection booth , the sound would be raised for one film to elucidate that &quot; story &quot; while it was lowered for the other .
the multiplication of images evoked War@@ hol &apos;s seminal silk @-@ screen works of the early 1960s .
War@@ hol was a fan of film@@ maker Rad@@ ley Met@@ z@@ ger film work and commented that Met@@ z@@ ger &apos;s film , &quot; The L@@ ick@@ er@@ ish Quartet &quot; , was &quot; an outrage@@ ously kin@@ ky masterpiece . &quot; &quot; Blue Movie &quot; - a film in which War@@ hol superstar Vi@@ va makes love in bed with Louis Wal@@ don , another War@@ hol superstar - was War@@ hol &apos;s last film as director .
the film , a seminal film in the Golden Age of Por@@ n , was , at the time , controversial for its frank approach to a sexual encounter . &quot;
Blue Movie &quot; was publicly screened in New York City in 2005 , for the first time in more than 30 years .
after his June 3 , 1968 , shooting , a re@@ clusive War@@ hol relinquished his personal involvement in film@@ making .
his ac@@ oly@@ te and assistant director , Paul Mor@@ ris@@ sey , took over the film @-@ making chores for the Factory collective , steering War@@ hol @-@ branded cinema towards more mainstream , narrative @-@ based , B @-@ movie exploitation fare with &quot; Fl@@ esh &quot; , &quot; Tra@@ sh &quot; , and &quot; Heat &quot; .
all of these films , including the later &quot; Andy War@@ hol &apos;s Drac@@ ula &quot; and &quot; Andy War@@ hol &apos;s Frank@@ en@@ stein &quot; , were far more mainstream than anything War@@ hol as a director had attempted .
these latter &quot; War@@ hol &quot; films star@@ red Joe D@@ all@@ es@@ andro - more of a Mor@@ ris@@ sey star than a true War@@ hol superstar .
in the early 1970s , most of the films directed by War@@ hol were pulled out of circulation by War@@ hol and the people around him who ran his business .
after War@@ hol &apos;s death , the films were slowly restored by the Whit@@ ney Museum and are occasionally projected at museums and film festivals .
few of the War@@ hol @-@ directed films are available on video or DVD .
</p>
<p>
in the mid @-@ 1960s , War@@ hol adopted the band the Vel@@ vet Underground , making them a crucial element of the Explo@@ ding Plastic In@@ ev@@ itable multimedia performance art show .
War@@ hol , with Paul Mor@@ ris@@ sey , acted as the band &apos;s manager , introducing them to N@@ ico .
while managing The Vel@@ vet Underground , Andy would have them dressed in all black to perform in front of movies that he was also presenting .
in 1966 he &quot; produced &quot; their first album &quot; The Vel@@ vet Underground &amp; N@@ ico &quot; , as well as providing its album art .
his actual participation in the album &apos;s production amounted to simply paying for the studio time .
after the band &apos;s first album , War@@ hol and band leader Lou Reed started to disagree more about the direction the band should take , and their artistic friendship ended .
in 1989 , after War@@ hol &apos;s death , Reed and John C@@ ale re @-@ united for the first time since 1972 to write , perform , record and release the concept album &quot; Son@@ gs for D@@ rella &quot; , a tribute to War@@ hol .
War@@ hol designed many album covers for various artists starting with the photographic cover of John W@@ allow@@ itch &apos;s debut album , &quot; This Is John W@@ allow@@ itch ! ! ! &quot; .
he designed the cover art for The Rolling St@@ ones &apos; albums &quot; S@@ tic@@ ky F@@ ing@@ ers &quot; and &quot; Love You Live &quot; , and the John C@@ ale albums &quot; The Academy in Per@@ il &quot; and &quot; Hon@@ i So@@ it &quot; in 1981 .
one of War@@ hol &apos;s last works was a portrait of Are@@ tha Franklin for the cover of her 1986 gold album &quot; Are@@ tha &quot; , which was done in the style of the &quot; Re@@ igning Queens &quot; series he had completed the year before .
War@@ hol strongly influenced the new wave / punk rock band D@@ evo , as well as David Bo@@ wie .
Bo@@ wie recorded a song called &quot; Andy War@@ hol &quot; for his 1971 album &quot; Hun@@ ky D@@ ory &quot; .
Lou Reed wrote the song &quot; Andy &apos;s Ch@@ est , &quot; about Valerie Sol@@ anas , the woman who shot War@@ hol , in 1968 .
he recorded it with the Vel@@ vet Underground , and this version was released on the &quot; V@@ U &quot; album in 1985 .
Bo@@ wie would later play War@@ hol in the 1996 movie , &quot; Bas@@ qui@@ at &quot; .
Bo@@ wie recalled how meeting War@@ hol in real life helped him in the role , and recounted his early meetings with him :
I met him a couple of times , but we seldom shared more than pl@@ ati@@ tudes .
the first time we saw each other an awkward silence fell till he remarked my bright yellow shoes and started talking enthusiastically .
he wanted to be very superficial .
and seemingly emo@@ tionless , indifferent , just like a dead fish .
Lou Reed described him most profoundly when he once told me they should bring a doll of Andy on the market : a doll that you wind up and doesn &apos;t do anything .
but I managed to observe him well , and that was a helping hand for the film &#91; &quot; Bas@@ qui@@ at &quot; ... &#93;
we borrowed his clothes from the museum in Pittsburgh , and they were intact , un@@ washed .
even the pockets weren &apos;t emptied : they contained pancake , white , deadly pale &quot; &quot; which Andy always s@@ meared on his face , a check torn in pieces , someone &apos;s address , lots of home@@ opathic pills and a wig .
Andy always wore those silver wi@@ gs , but he never admitted it were wi@@ gs .
one of his hair@@ dres@@ sers has told me lately that he had his wi@@ gs regularly cut , like it were real hair .
when the wig was trimmed , he put on another next month as if his hair had grown .
</p>
<p>
beginning in the early 1950s , War@@ hol produced several un@@ bound portfolios of his work .
the first of several bound self @-@ published books by War@@ hol was &quot; 25 C@@ ats Name Sam and One Blue P@@ us@@ sy &quot; , printed in 1954 by Sey@@ m@@ our Berlin on Ar@@ ches brand water@@ marked paper using his bl@@ otted line technique for the litho@@ graphs .
the original edition was limited to 190 numbered , hand colored copies , using Dr. Martin &apos;s ink washes .
most of these were given by War@@ hol as gifts to clients and friends .
copy No. 4 , inscribed &quot; Jerry &quot; on the front cover and given to Ger@@ al@@ dine St@@ ut@@ z , was used for a facsimile printing in 1987 , and the original was auctioned in May 2006 for US $ 35,000 by Doyle New York .
other self @-@ published books by War@@ hol include : War@@ hol &apos;s book &quot; A La Rec@@ her@@ che du Sho@@ e Per@@ du &quot; marked his &quot; transition from commercial to gallery artist . &quot; after gaining fame , War@@ hol &quot; wrote &quot; several books that were commercially published :
War@@ hol created the fashion magazine &quot; Interview &quot; that is still published today .
the loop@@ y title script on the cover is thought to be either his own handwriting or that of his mother , Julia War@@ hol@@ a , who would often do text work for his early commercial pieces .
</p>
<p>
although Andy War@@ hol is most known for his paintings and films , he authored works in many different media .
</p>
<p>
he founded the gossip magazine &quot; Interview &quot; , a stage for celebrities he &quot; endorsed &quot; and a business staffed by his friends .
he collaborated with others on all of his books He adopted the young painter Jean @-@ Michel Bas@@ qui@@ at , and the band The Vel@@ vet Underground , presenting them to the public as his latest interest , and collaborating with them .
one might even say that he produced people .
he endorsed products , appeared in commercials , and made frequent celebrity guest appearances on television shows and in films .
in this respect War@@ hol was a fan of &quot; Art Business &quot; and &quot; Business Art &quot; - he , in fact , wrote about his interest in thinking about art as business in &quot; The Philosophy of Andy War@@ hol from A to B and Back Again &quot; .
</p>
<p>
interviewed in 1980 , he indicated that he was still a virgin .
bi@@ ographer Bob Col@@ ac@@ ello , who was present at the interview , felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably &quot; a mixture of vo@@ ye@@ ur@@ ism and mastur@@ bation - to use &#91; Andy &apos;s &#93; word &quot; abstract &quot; . &quot; War@@ hol &apos;s assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for con@@ dyl@@ om@@ ata , a sexually transmitted disease .
it has also been contradicted by his lovers , including War@@ hol m@@ use Bill@@ y@@ Boy , who has said they had sex to orgasm :
&quot; when he wasn &apos;t being Andy War@@ hol and when you were just alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person . what se@@ duced me was the Andy War@@ hol who I saw alone . in fact when I was with him in public he kind of got on my nerves .... I &apos;d say : &apos; you &apos;re just ob@@ noxious , I can &apos;t bear you . &quot; Billy Name also denied that War@@ hol was only a vo@@ ye@@ ur , saying :
&quot; he was the essence of sexuality . it permeated everything . Andy ex@@ uded it , along with his great artistic creativity .... It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York . &quot; &quot; but his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front . &quot; War@@ hol &apos;s lovers included John Gior@@ no , Billy Name , Charles Lis@@ an@@ by , and Jon G@@ ould .
his boyfriend of 12 years was J@@ ed Johnson , whom he met in 1968 , and who later achieved fame as an interior designer .
the fact that War@@ hol &apos;s homosexuality influenced his work and shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and is an issue that War@@ hol himself addressed in interviews , in conversation with his contemporaries , and in his publications .
throughout his career , War@@ hol produced erotic photography and drawings of male n@@ udes .
many of his most famous works draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire .
as has been addressed by a range of scholars , many of his films premi@@ ered in gay porn theaters , including the New Andy War@@ hol Gar@@ rick Theatre and 55th Street Play@@ house , in the late 1960s .
the first works that War@@ hol submitted to a fine art gallery , homo@@ erotic drawings of male n@@ udes , were rejected for being too openly gay .
in &quot; Pop@@ ism &quot; , furthermore , the artist recalls a conversation with the film maker Emile de Antonio about the difficulty War@@ hol had being accepted socially by the then @-@ more @-@ famous gay artists Jas@@ per Johns and Robert R@@ aus@@ ch@@ enberg .
de Antonio explained that War@@ hol was &quot; too s@@ wish and that up@@ sets them . &quot; in response to this , War@@ hol writes , &quot; There was nothing I could say to that . it was all too true . so I decided I just wasn &apos;t going to care , because those were all the things that I didn &apos;t want to change anyway , that I didn &apos;t think I &apos; should &apos; want to change ... Other people could change their attitudes but not me . &quot; in exploring War@@ hol &apos;s biography , many turn to this period - the late 1950s and early 1960s - as a key moment in the development of his persona .
some have suggested that his frequent refusal to comment on his work , to speak about himself - and even the evolution of his pop style - can be traced to the years when War@@ hol was first dismissed by the inner circles of the New York art world .
</p>
<p>
War@@ hol was a practicing Ru@@ then@@ ian Catholic .
he regularly volunteered at homeless shelters in New York City , particularly during the busi@@ er times of the year , and described himself as a religious person .
many of War@@ hol &apos;s later works depicted religious subjects , including two series , &quot; Details of Renaissance Pain@@ tings &quot; and &quot; The Last Sup@@ per &quot; .
in addition , a body of religious @-@ themed works was found pos@@ thum@@ ously in his estate .
during his life , War@@ hol regularly attended Lit@@ ur@@ gy , and the priest at War@@ hol &apos;s church , Saint Vincent Ferrer , said that the artist went there almost daily , although he was not observed taking Comm@@ union or going to Conf@@ ession and sat or knelt in the pe@@ ws at the back .
the priest thought he was afraid of being recognized ;
War@@ hol said he was self @-@ conscious about being seen in a Roman R@@ ite church crossing himself &quot; in the Orthodox way &quot; .
his art is noticeably influenced by the Eastern Christian tradition which was so evident in his places of worship .
War@@ hol &apos;s brother has described the artist as &quot; really religious , but he didn &apos;t want people to know about that because &#91; it was &#93; private . &quot; despite the private nature of his faith , in War@@ hol &apos;s eul@@ ogy John Richardson depicted it as devout :
&quot; to my certain knowledge , he was responsible for at least one conversion . he took considerable pride in financing his nephew &apos;s studies for the pri@@ es@@ thood . &quot;

War@@ hol was an avid collector .
his friends referred to his numerous collections , which filled not only his four @-@ story town@@ house , but also a nearby storage unit , as &quot; Andy &apos;s Stu@@ ff . &quot; the true extent of his collections was not discovered until after his death , when the Andy War@@ hol Museum in Pittsburgh took in 641 boxes of his &quot; Stu@@ ff . &quot; War@@ hol &apos;s collections included a Coca @-@ cola memor@@ abil@@ ia sign , and 19th century paintings along with airplane menus , unpaid invoices , pizza dough , pornographic pulp novels , newspapers , stamps , supermarket flyers , and cookie jars , among other eccentr@@ icities .
it also included significant works of art , such as George Bel@@ lows &apos;s &quot; Miss Ben@@ tham &quot; .
one of his main collections was his wi@@ gs .
War@@ hol owned more than 40 and felt very protective of his hair@@ pieces , which were sewn by a New York wig @-@ maker from hair imported from Italy .
in 1985 a girl snatched War@@ hol &apos;s wig off his head .
it was later discovered in War@@ hol &apos;s diary entry for that day that he wrote :
&quot; I don &apos;t know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony . &quot; another item found in War@@ hol &apos;s boxes at the museum in Pittsburgh was a mum@@ mi@@ fied human foot from Ancient Egypt .
the curator of anthropology at Carnegie Museum of Natural History felt that War@@ hol most likely found it at a flea market .

War@@ hol died in Manhattan at 6 : 32 a.m. on February 22 , 1987 at age 58 .
according to news reports , he had been making a good recovery from gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital before dying in his sleep from a sudden post @-@ operative irregular heartbeat .
prior to his diagnosis and operation , War@@ hol delayed having his recurring gallbladder problems checked , as he was afraid to enter hospitals and see doctors .
his family sued the hospital for inadequate care , saying that the arrhyth@@ mia was caused by improper care and water intoxication .
the malpractice case was quickly settled out of court ; War@@ hol &apos;s family received an undisclosed sum of money .
shortly before War@@ hol &apos;s death , doctors expected War@@ hol to survive the surgery , though a revaluation of the case about thirty years after his death showed many indications that War@@ hol &apos;s surgery was in fact riskier than originally thought .
it was widely reported at the time that War@@ hol died of a &quot; routine &quot; surgery , though when considering factors such as his age , a family history of gallbladder problems , his previous gunshot wounds , and his medical state in the weeks leading up to the procedure , the potential risk of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant .
War@@ hol &apos;s brothers took his body back to Pittsburgh , where an open @-@ coffin wake was held at the Thomas P. Kun@@ s@@ ak Fun@@ eral Home .
the solid bronze casket had gold @-@ plated rails and white uphol@@ stery .
War@@ hol was dressed in a black cashmere suit , a pa@@ is@@ ley tie , a platinum wig , and sunglasses .
he was laid out holding a small prayer book and a red rose .
the funeral lit@@ ur@@ gy was held at the Holy Ghost Byzantine Catholic Church on Pittsburgh &apos;s North Side .
the eul@@ ogy was given by Mon@@ signor Peter T@@ ay .
Yok@@ o O@@ no and John Richardson were speakers .
the coffin was covered with white roses and asparagus fer@@ ns .
after the lit@@ ur@@ gy , the coffin was driven to St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery in Bethel Park , a south suburb of Pittsburgh .
at the grave , the priest said a brief prayer and sprinkled holy water on the casket .
before the coffin was lowered , Pa@@ ige Powell dropped a copy of &quot; Interview &quot; magazine , an &quot; Interview &quot; T @-@ shirt , and a bottle of the E@@ ste@@ e L@@ aud@@ er perfume &quot; Beautiful &quot; into the grave .
War@@ hol was buried next to his mother and father .
a memorial service was held in Manhattan for War@@ hol on April 1 , 1987 , at St. Patrick &apos;s Cathedral , New York .

War@@ hol &apos;s will dictated that his entire estate - with the exception of a few modest legacies to family members - would go to create a foundation dedicated to the &quot; advancement of the visual arts . &quot; War@@ hol had so many possessions that it took So@@ the@@ by &apos;s nine days to auction his estate after his death ; the auction gro@@ ssed more than US $ 20 million .
in 1987 , in accordance with War@@ hol &apos;s will , the Andy War@@ hol Foundation for the Visual Arts began .
the foundation serves as the estate of Andy War@@ hol , but also has a mission &quot; to foster innovative artistic expression and the creative process &quot; and is &quot; focused primarily on supporting work of a challenging and often experimental nature . &quot; the Artists Rights Society is the U.S. copyright representative for the Andy War@@ hol Foundation for the Visual Arts for all War@@ hol works with the exception of War@@ hol film stil@@ ls .
the U.S. copyright representative for War@@ hol film stil@@ ls is the War@@ hol Museum in Pittsburgh .
additionally , the Andy War@@ hol Foundation for the Visual Arts has agreements in place for its image archive .
all digital images of War@@ hol are exclusively managed by Cor@@ bis , while all transparency images of War@@ hol are managed by Art Resource .
the Andy War@@ hol Foundation released its &quot; 20th Anniversary Annual Report &quot; as a three @-@ volume set in 2007 : Vol .
II , Grants &amp; Exhi@@ bitions ; and Vol .
the Foundation remains one of the largest grant @-@ giving organizations for the visual arts in the U.S. Many of War@@ hol &apos;s works and possessions are on display at The Andy War@@ hol Museum in Pittsburgh .
the foundation donated more than 3,000 works of art to the museum .

AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an , real name Muhammad bin Daw@@ ud Ch@@ ag@@ h@@ ri , was the second Sultan of the Sel@@ ju@@ k Empire and great @-@ grandson of Sel@@ ju@@ k , the ep@@ onymous founder of the dynasty .
as Sultan , Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an greatly expanded Sel@@ ju@@ k territory and consolidated power , defeating rivals to his south and northwest .
his victory over the Byz@@ an@@ tines at the Battle of Manz@@ ik@@ ert in 10@@ 71 ushered in the Turkish settlement of Anatol@@ ia .
for his military prowess and fighting skills he obtained the name &quot; Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an &quot; , which means &quot; Her@@ o@@ ic Lion &quot; in Turkish .
</p>
<p>
AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an accompanied his uncle , Tu@@ gh@@ ril B@@ ey , on campaigns in the south against the Shia Fati@@ mids while his father , Ç@@ a@@ ğ@@ r@@ ı B@@ ey , remained in Khor@@ asan .
upon Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an &apos;s return to Khor@@ asan , he began his work in administration at his father &apos;s suggestion .
while there , his father introduced him to Niz@@ am al @-@ Mul@@ k , one of the most eminent statesmen in early Muslim history and Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an &apos;s future vi@@ z@@ ier .
after the death of his father , Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an succeeded him as governor of Khor@@ asan in 10@@ 59 .
his uncle Tu@@ gh@@ ril died in 10@@ 63 and was succeeded by Suleiman , Ar@@ sl@@ an &apos;s brother .
Ar@@ sl@@ an and his uncle Kut@@ al@@ m@@ ish both contested this succession . ( &quot; see &quot; Battle of Dam@@ ghan ) Ar@@ sl@@ an defeated Kut@@ al@@ m@@ ish for the throne and succeeded on 27 April 10@@ 64 as sul@@ tan of Great Sel@@ ju@@ q , thus becoming sole monarch of Persia from the river Ox@@ us to the Tig@@ ris .
in consolidating his empire and subdu@@ ing contending factions , Ar@@ sl@@ an was ably assisted by Niz@@ am al @-@ Mul@@ k , and the two are credited with helping to stabilize the empire after the death of Tu@@ gh@@ ril .
with peace and security established in his dom@@ inions , Ar@@ sl@@ an convo@@ ked an assembly of the states and in 10@@ 66 , he declared his son Malik Shah I his heir and successor .
with the hope of capturing Caes@@ area Maz@@ aca , the capital of C@@ app@@ ad@@ o@@ cia , he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry , crossed the Euphrates , and entered and invaded the city .
along with Niz@@ am al @-@ Mul@@ k , he then marched into Armenia and Georgia , which he conquered in 10@@ 64 .
after a siege of 25 days , the Sel@@ ju@@ ks captured An@@ i , the capital city of Armenia .
an account of the sack and massacres in An@@ i is given by the historian Si@@ b@@ t i@@ bn al @-@ Jaw@@ zi , who quotes an eyewitness saying :
putting the Persian sword to work , they spared no one ...
one could see there the grief and calamity of every age of human kind .
for children were rav@@ ished from the embraces of their mothers and mercil@@ essly hurled against rocks , while the mothers drenched them with tears and blood ...
the city became filled from one end to the other with bodies of the slain and &#91; the bodies of the slain &#93; became a road . &#91; ... &#93;
the army entered the city , massacred its inhabitants , pill@@ aged and burned it , leaving it in ruins and taking prisoner all those who remained alive ... The dead bodies were so many that they blocked the streets ; one could not go anywhere without stepping over them .
and the number of prisoners was not less than 50,000 souls .
I was determined to enter city and see the destruction with my own eyes .
I tried to find a street in which I would not have to walk over the corpses ; but that was impossible .

en route to fight the Fati@@ mids in Syria in 10@@ 68 , Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an invaded the Byzantine Empire .
the Emperor Rom@@ anos IV Di@@ o@@ genes , assuming command in person , met the invaders in C@@ il@@ ic@@ ia .
in three arduous campaigns , the Turks were defeated in detail and driven across the Euphrates in 10@@ 70 .
the first two campaigns were conducted by the emperor himself , while the third was directed by Manuel Com@@ n@@ en@@ os , great @-@ uncle of Emperor Manuel Com@@ n@@ en@@ os .
during this time , Ar@@ sl@@ an gained the allegiance of Rashid al @-@ Daw@@ la Mahmud , the Mir@@ da@@ si@@ d em@@ ir of Aleppo .
in 10@@ 71 Rom@@ anos again took the field and advanced into Armenia with possibly 30,000 men , including a contingent of C@@ uman Turks as well as contingents of Fran@@ ks and Nor@@ mans , under Ur@@ sel de Bai@@ eu@@ l .
AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an , who had moved his troops south to fight the Fati@@ mids , quickly reversed to meet the Byz@@ an@@ tines .
at Manz@@ ik@@ ert , on the Mur@@ at River , north of Lake Van , the two forces waged the Battle of Manz@@ ik@@ ert .
the C@@ uman mercenaries among the Byzantine forces immediately defec@@ ted to the Turkish side .
seeing this , &quot; the Western mercenaries rode off and took no part in the battle . &quot; to be exact , Rom@@ anos was betrayed by general And@@ ron@@ ik@@ os Dou@@ kas , son of the Caesar , who pronounced him dead and rode off with a large part of the Byzantine forces at a critical moment .
the Byz@@ an@@ tines were totally routed .
Emperor Rom@@ anos IV was himself taken prisoner and conducted into the presence of Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an .
after a ritual humiliation , Ar@@ sl@@ an treated him with generosity .
after peace terms were agreed to , Ar@@ sl@@ an dismissed the Emperor , loaded with presents and respectfully attended by a military guard .
the following conversation is said to have taken place after Rom@@ anos was brought as a prisoner before the Sultan : &quot; AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an &quot; :
&quot; what would you do if I was brought before you as a prisoner ? &quot; &quot; Rom@@ anos &quot; :
&quot; perhaps I &apos;d kill you , or exhibit you in the streets of Constan@@ tin@@ o@@ ple . &quot; &quot; AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an &quot; :
&quot; my punishment is far heavier . I forgive you , and set you free . &quot; AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an &apos;s victories changed the balance in near Asia completely in favour of the Sel@@ ju@@ q Turks and Sunni Muslims .
while the Byzantine Empire was to continue for nearly four more centuries , and the Crus@@ ades would contest the issue for some time , the victory at Manz@@ ik@@ ert signalled the beginning of Turkish ascend@@ ancy in Anatol@@ ia .
most historians , including Edward Gib@@ bon , date the defeat at Manz@@ ik@@ ert as the beginning of the end of the Eastern Roman Empire .
</p>
<p>
AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an &apos;s strength lay in the military realm .
domestic affairs were handled by his able vi@@ z@@ ier , Niz@@ am al @-@ Mul@@ k , the founder of the administrative organization that characterized and strengthened the sul@@ tan@@ ate during the reigns of Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an and his son , Malik Shah .
military fi@@ efs , governed by Sel@@ ju@@ q princes , were established to provide support for the soldi@@ ery and to accommodate the nomadic Turks to the established Anatol@@ ian agricultural scene .
this type of military fi@@ ef@@ dom enabled the nomadic Turks to draw on the resources of the sedentary Per@@ sians , Turks , and other established cultures within the Sel@@ ju@@ q realm , and allowed Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an to field a huge standing army without depending on tribute from conquest to pay his soldiers .
he not only had enough food from his subjects to maintain his military , but the taxes collected from traders and merchants added to his coffers sufficiently to fund his continuous wars .
according to the poet Saadi Shi@@ ra@@ zi : Ar@@ sl@@ an possessed a fort , which raised at the height of Al@@ wand , from all were those within its walls , for its roads were a labyrinth , like the curls of a bride .
from a learned traveler Ar@@ sl@@ an once inquired : &quot; didst thou ever , in thy wander@@ ings , see a fort as strong as this ? &quot; &quot; splendid it is , &quot; was the traveler &apos;s reply , &quot; but meth@@ inks not it confers much strength . before thee , did not other kings possess it for a while , then pass away ? after thee , will not other kings assume control , and eat the fruits of the tree of thy hope ? &quot; in the estimation of the wise , the world is a false gem that passes each moment from one hand to another .
Suleiman i@@ bn Kut@@ al@@ m@@ ish was the son of the contender for Ar@@ sl@@ an &apos;s throne ; he was appointed governor of the north @-@ western provinces and assigned to completing the invasion of Anatol@@ ia .
an explanation for this choice can only be conjec@@ tured from Ibn al @-@ Ath@@ ir &apos;s account of the battle between Al@@ p @-@ Ar@@ sl@@ an and Kut@@ al@@ m@@ ish , in which he writes that Al@@ p @-@ Ar@@ sl@@ an wept for the latter &apos;s death and greatly mourned the loss of his kin@@ sman .
</p>
<p>
after Manz@@ ik@@ ert , the dominion of Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an extended over much of western Asia .
he soon prepared to march for the conquest of Turk@@ estan , the original seat of his ancestors .
with a powerful army he advanced to the banks of the Ox@@ us .
before he could pass the river with safety , however , it was necessary to subdue certain fort@@ resses , one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor , Yus@@ su@@ f al @-@ Kha@@ re@@ z@@ mi , a Kh@@ ware@@ z@@ mian .
he was obliged to surrender , however , and was carried as a prisoner before the sul@@ tan , who condemned him to death .
Yus@@ su@@ f , in desperation , drew his dagger and rushed upon the sul@@ tan .
AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an , who took great pride in his reputation as an arch@@ er , mo@@ tioned to his guards not to interfere .
he drew his bow , but his foot slipped , the arrow glanced aside , and he received the assassin &apos;s dagger in his breast .
AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an died from this wound four days later , on 25 November 10@@ 72 , in his 42nd year , and he was taken to Mer@@ v to be buried next to his father , Ch@@ ag@@ h@@ ri Be@@ g .
</p>
<p>
AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an is widely regarded as having begun Anat@@ oli@@ anism , although unintentionally .
his victory at Manz@@ ik@@ ert is often cited as the beginning of the end of Byzantine power in Anatol@@ ia , and the beginning of Turkish identity there .
AL@@ P Ar@@ sl@@ an &apos;s conquest of Anatol@@ ia from the Byz@@ an@@ tines is also seen as one of the pivotal precursors to the launch of the crus@@ ades .
from 2002 to July 2008 under Turkmen calendar reform , the month of August was named after Al@@ p Ar@@ sl@@ an .

Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa was a Japanese film director and screen@@ writer , who directed 30 films in a career spanning 57 years .
he is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936 , following a brief stint as a painter .
after years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scrip@@ tw@@ rit@@ er , he made his debut as a director during World War II with the popular action film &quot; San@@ shir@@ o Su@@ g@@ ata &quot; .
after the war , the critically acclaimed &quot; D@@ run@@ ken Angel &quot; , in which Kuro@@ s@@ awa cast then @-@ unknown actor To@@ shir@@ o Mi@@ fun@@ e in a starring role , cemented the director &apos;s reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan .
the two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films . &quot;
Rash@@ omon &quot; , which premi@@ ered in Tokyo , became the surprise winner of the Golden Lion at the 1951 Venice Film Festival .
the commercial and critical success of that film opened up Western film markets for the first time to the products of the Japanese film industry , which in turn led to international recognition for other Japanese filmmakers .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa directed approximately one film per year throughout the 1950s and early 1960s , including a number of highly regarded films , such as &quot; I@@ kir@@ u &quot; , &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; and &quot; Yo@@ j@@ im@@ bo &quot; .
after the 1960s he became much less prolific ; even so , his later work - including his final two ep@@ ics , &quot; Kag@@ em@@ usha &quot; and &quot; R@@ an &quot; - continued to win awards , though more often abroad than in Japan .
in 1990 , he accepted the Academy Award for Life@@ time Achievement .
pos@@ thum@@ ously , he was named &quot; Asian of the Century &quot; in the &quot; Arts , Literature , and Culture &quot; category by &quot; Asi@@ an@@ Week &quot; magazine and CNN , cited there as being among the five people who most prominently contributed to the improvement of Asia in the 20th century .
his career has been honored by many retrospec@@ tives , critical studies and bi@@ ographies in both print and video , and by releases in many consumer media formats .
</p>
<p>
was born on March 23 , 1910 , in Ō@@ im@@ achi in the Ō@@ mor@@ i district of Tokyo .
his father Is@@ am@@ u , a member of a sam@@ u@@ rai family from Ak@@ ita Prefecture , worked as the director of the Army &apos;s Physical Education Institute &apos;s lower secondary school , while his mother S@@ hima came from a merchant &apos;s family living in Osaka .
Ak@@ ira was the eighth and youngest child of the moderately wealthy family , with two of his siblings already grown up at the time of his birth and one deceased , leaving Kuro@@ s@@ awa to grow up with three sisters and a brother .
in addition to promoting physical exercise , Is@@ am@@ u Kuro@@ s@@ awa was open to Western traditions and considered theater and motion pictures to have educational merit .
he encouraged his children to watch films ; young Ak@@ ira viewed his first movies at the age of six .
an important formative influence was his elementary school teacher Mr T@@ achi@@ kawa , whose progressive educational practices ignited in his young pupil first a love of drawing and then an interest in education in general .
during this time , the boy also studied calligraphy and K@@ endo sword@@ s@@ manship .
another major childhood influence was He@@ igo Kuro@@ s@@ awa , Ak@@ ira &apos;s older brother by four years .
in the aftermath of the Great K@@ ant@@ ō earthquake of 1923 , which devastated Tokyo , He@@ igo took the 13 @-@ year @-@ old Ak@@ ira to view the devastation .
when the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere , He@@ igo forbade him to do so , instead encouraging Ak@@ ira to face his fears by confronting them directly .
some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s later artistic career , as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work .
He@@ igo was academically gifted , but soon after failing to secure a place in Tokyo &apos;s foremost high school , he began to detach himself from the rest of the family , preferring to concentrate on his interest in foreign literature .
in the late 1920s , He@@ igo became a ben@@ shi for Tokyo theaters showing foreign films , and quickly made a name for himself .
Ak@@ ira , who at this point planned to become a painter , moved in with him , and the two brothers became inseparable .
with He@@ igo &apos;s guidance , Ak@@ ira devoured not only films but also theater and circus performances , while exhibiting his paintings and working for the left @-@ wing Pro@@ let@@ arian Artists &apos; League .
however , he was never able to make a living with his art , and , as he began to perceive most of the prolet@@ arian movement as &quot; putting unfulfilled political ideals directly onto the canvas , &quot; he lost his enthusiasm for painting .
with the increasing production of talking pictures in the early 1930s , film narr@@ ators like He@@ igo began to lose work , and Ak@@ ira moved back in with his parents .
in July 1933 , He@@ igo committed suicide .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa has commented on the lasting sense of loss he felt at his brother &apos;s death and the chapter of his autobiography that describes it - written nearly half a century after the event - is titled , &quot; A Story I Don &apos;t Want to Tell . &quot; only four months later , Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s eldest brother also died , leaving Ak@@ ira , at age 23 , the only one of the Kuro@@ s@@ awa brothers still living , together with his three surviving sisters .
</p>
<p>
in 1935 , the new film studio Photo Chemical Laboratories , known as P.@@ C.@@ L. , advertised for assistant directors .
although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession , Kuro@@ s@@ awa submitted the required essay , which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films and find ways to overcome them .
his half @-@ mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental , there was no way to correct them .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s essay earned him a call to take the follow @-@ up exams , and director Kaj@@ ir@@ ō Yamamoto , who was among the examiners , took a liking to Kuro@@ s@@ awa and insisted that the studio hire him .
the 25 @-@ year @-@ old Kuro@@ s@@ awa joined P.@@ C.@@ L. in February 1936 .
during his five years as an assistant director , Kuro@@ s@@ awa worked under numerous directors , but by far the most important figure in his development was Yamamoto .
of his 24 films as A.D. , he worked on 17 under Yamamoto , many of them come@@ dies featuring the popular actor Ken &apos;@@ ichi En@@ om@@ oto , known as &quot; E@@ no@@ ken . &quot; Yamamoto nurtured Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s talent , promoting him directly from third assistant director to chief assistant director after a year .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s responsibilities increased , and he worked at tasks ranging from stage construction and film development to location sc@@ outing , script polishing , rehear@@ sals , lighting , du@@ bbing , editing and second @-@ unit directing .
in the last of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s films as an assistant director for Yamamoto , &quot; Horse &quot; , Kuro@@ s@@ awa took over most of the production , as his mentor was occupied with the shooting of another film .
one important piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kuro@@ s@@ awa was that a good director needed to master screen@@ writing .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa would later write or co @-@ write all of his own films .
he also frequently wrote screen@@ plays for other directors such as for the anti@@ war film director Sat@@ su@@ o Yamamoto &apos;s film , &quot; A Tri@@ um@@ ph of W@@ ings &quot; .
this outside scrip@@ tw@@ riting would serve Kuro@@ s@@ awa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s , long after he became world @-@ famous .
</p>
<p>
in the two years following the release of &quot; Horse &quot; in 1941 , Kuro@@ s@@ awa searched for a story he could use to launch his directing career .
towards the end of 1942 , about a year after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , novelist Tsu@@ neo Tom@@ ita published his Mus@@ ashi Miy@@ amoto @-@ inspired jud@@ o novel , &quot; San@@ shir@@ o Su@@ g@@ ata &quot; , the advertisements for which intrigued Kuro@@ s@@ awa .
he bought the book on its publication day , devoured it in one sitting , and immediately asked To@@ ho to secure the film rights .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s initial instinct proved correct as , within a few days , three other major Japanese studios also offered to buy the rights .
To@@ ho prevailed , and Kuro@@ s@@ awa began pre @-@ production on his debut work as director .
shooting of &quot; San@@ shir@@ o Su@@ g@@ ata &quot; began on location in Yokohama in December 1942 .
production proceeded smoothly , but getting the completed film past the cens@@ ors was an entirely different matter .
the censorship office considered the work to be objec@@ tion@@ ably &quot; British @-@ American &quot; by the standards of wartime Japan , and it was only through the intervention of director Yasu@@ j@@ ir@@ ō Oz@@ u , who championed the film , that &quot; San@@ shir@@ o Su@@ g@@ ata &quot; was finally accepted for release on March 25 , 1943 .
the movie became both a critical and commercial success .
nevertheless , the censorship office would later decide to cut out some 18 minutes of footage , much of which is now considered lost .
he next turned to the subject of wartime female factory workers in &quot; The Most Beautiful &quot; , a propaganda film which he shot in a semi @-@ documentary style in early 1944 .
in order to coax realistic performances from his actresses , the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot , eat the factory food and call each other by their character names .
he would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career .
during production , the actress playing the leader of the factory workers , Y@@ ō@@ ko Y@@ aguchi , was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director .
she and Kuro@@ s@@ awa were constantly at lo@@ gg@@ er@@ heads , and it was through these arguments that the two , paradoxically , became close .
they married on May 21 , 1945 , with Y@@ aguchi two months pregnant , and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985 .
they would have two children , both surviving Kuro@@ s@@ awa : a son , His@@ ao , born December 20 , 1945 , who would serve as producer on some of his father &apos;s last projects , and Kaz@@ u@@ ko , a daughter , born April 29 , 1954 , who would become a costume designer .
shortly before his marriage , Kuro@@ s@@ awa was pressured by the studio against his will to direct a sequel to his debut film .
the often blatantly propag@@ an@@ dis@@ tic &quot; San@@ shir@@ o Su@@ g@@ ata Part II &quot; , which premi@@ ered in May 1945 , is generally considered one of his weakest pictures .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa decided to write the script for a film that would be both censor @-@ friendly and less expensive to produce . &quot;
the Men Who T@@ read on the Tiger &apos;s Ta@@ il &quot; , based on the Kab@@ uki play &quot; K@@ anj@@ in@@ ch@@ ō &quot; and starring the comedian E@@ no@@ ken , with whom Kuro@@ s@@ awa had often worked during his assistant director days , was completed in September 1945 .
by this time , Japan had surrendered and the occupation of Japan had begun .
the new American cens@@ ors interpreted the values allegedly promoted in the picture as overly &quot; feudal &quot; and banned the work .
ironically , while in production , the film had already been sav@@ aged by Japanese wartime cens@@ ors as too Western and &quot; democratic &quot; , so the movie most probably would not have seen the light of day even if the war had continued beyond its completion .
</p>
<p>
after the war , Kuro@@ s@@ awa , influenced by the democratic ideals of the Occupation , sought to make films that would establish a new respect towards the individual and the self .
the first such film , &quot; No Reg@@ rets for Our Youth &quot; , inspired by both the 1933 Tak@@ ig@@ awa incident and the Hot@@ sum@@ i Oz@@ aki wartime spy case , criticized Japan &apos;s pre@@ war regime for its political oppression .
at@@ yp@@ ically for the director , the heroic central character is a woman , Yuk@@ ie , who born into upper @-@ middle @-@ class privilege , comes to question her values in a time of political crisis .
the original script had to be extensively rewritten and , because of its controversial theme , the completed work divided critics , but it nevertheless managed to win the approval of audiences , who turned variations on the film &apos;s title into a postwar catch@@ phrase .
his next film , &quot; One Won@@ der@@ ful Sunday &quot; premi@@ ered in July 1947 to mixed reviews .
it is a relatively un@@ complicated and sentimental love story dealing with an impoverished postwar couple trying to enjoy , within the devastation of postwar Tokyo , their one weekly day off .
the movie bears the influence of Frank Cap@@ ra , D. W. Griff@@ ith and F. W. Mur@@ n@@ au , each of whom was among Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s favorite directors .
another film released in 1947 with Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s involvement was the action @-@ adventure thriller , &quot; Snow Trail &quot; , directed by Sen@@ k@@ ichi Tan@@ ig@@ u@@ chi from Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s screen@@ play .
it marked the debut of the intense young actor To@@ shir@@ o Mi@@ fun@@ e .
it was Kuro@@ s@@ awa who , with his mentor Yamamoto , had intervened to persuade To@@ ho to sign Mi@@ fun@@ e , during an audition in which the young man greatly impressed Kuro@@ s@@ awa , but managed to alienate most of the other judges . &quot;
drunken Angel &quot; is often considered the director &apos;s first major work .
although the script , like all of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s occupation @-@ era works , had to go through forced re@@ writes due to American censorship , Kuro@@ s@@ awa felt that this was the first film in which he was able to express himself freely .
a grit@@ tily realistic story of a doctor who tries to save a gangster with tuberculosis , it was also the director &apos;s first film with To@@ shir@@ o Mi@@ fun@@ e , who would proceed to play either the main or a major character in all but one of the director &apos;s next 16 films .
while Mi@@ fun@@ e was not cast as the protagonist in &quot; D@@ run@@ ken Angel &quot; , his explosive performance as the gangster so dominates the drama that he shifted the focus from the title character , the alcoholic doctor played by Tak@@ ashi Shim@@ ura , who had already appeared in several Kuro@@ s@@ awa movies .
however , Kuro@@ s@@ awa did not want to s@@ mother the young actor &apos;s immense vitality , and Mi@@ fun@@ e &apos;s rebellious character electri@@ fied audiences in much the way that Mar@@ lon Bran@@ do &apos;s defiant stance would star@@ tle American film audiences a few years later .
the film premi@@ ered in Tokyo in April 1948 to ra@@ ve reviews and was chosen by the prestigious Kin@@ ema Jun@@ po critics poll as the best film of its year , the first of three Kuro@@ s@@ awa movies to be so honored .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa , with producer S@@ ō@@ j@@ ir@@ ō Mot@@ oki and fellow directors and friends Kaj@@ iro Yamamoto , Mik@@ io Nar@@ use and Sen@@ k@@ ichi Tan@@ ig@@ u@@ chi , formed a new independent production unit called Film Art Association .
for this organization &apos;s debut work , and first film for Dai@@ ei studios , Kuro@@ s@@ awa turned to a contemporary play by Kaz@@ uo Kik@@ uta and , together with Tan@@ ig@@ u@@ chi , adapted it for the screen . &quot;
the Qui@@ et Du@@ el &quot; star@@ red To@@ shir@@ o Mi@@ fun@@ e as an idealistic young doctor struggling with syphilis , a deliberate attempt by Kuro@@ s@@ awa to break the actor away from being ty@@ pec@@ ast as gangsters .
released in March 1949 , it was a box office success , but is generally considered one of the director &apos;s lesser achievements .
his second film of 1949 , also produced by Film Art Association and released by Shin@@ to@@ ho , was &quot; St@@ ray Dog &quot; .
it is a detective movie that explores the mood of Japan during its painful postwar recovery through the story of a young detective , played by Mi@@ fun@@ e , and his fixation on the recovery of his hand@@ gun , which was stolen by a pen@@ nil@@ ess war veteran who proceeds to use it to rob and murder .
adapted from an unpublished novel by Kuro@@ s@@ awa in the style of a favorite writer of his , Georges Si@@ men@@ on , it was the director &apos;s first collaboration with screen@@ writer R@@ yu@@ zo Kik@@ ushima , who would later help to script eight other Kuro@@ s@@ awa films .
a famous , virtually wor@@ dless sequence , lasting over eight minutes , shows the detective , disguised as an impoverished veteran , wandering the streets in search of the gun thief ; it employed actual documentary footage of war @-@ ravaged Tokyo neighborhoods shot by Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s friend , I@@ shir@@ ō Honda , the future director of &quot; God@@ z@@ illa &quot; .
the film is considered a precursor to the contemporary police procedural and buddy cop film genres . &quot;
scandal &quot; , released by Sho@@ chi@@ ku in April 1950 , was inspired by the director &apos;s personal experiences with , and anger towards , Japanese yellow journalism .
the work is an ambitious mixture of courtroom drama and social problem film about free speech and personal responsibility , but even Kuro@@ s@@ awa regarded the finished product as dramatically un@@ focused and unsatisfactory , and almost all critics agree . ; ; ;
however , it would be Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s second film of 1950 , &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; , that would ultimately win him , and Japanese cinema , a whole new international audience .
</p>
<p>
after finishing &quot; Scand@@ al &quot; , Kuro@@ s@@ awa was approached by Dai@@ ei studios , which asked the director to make another film for them .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa picked a script by an aspiring young screen@@ writer , Shin@@ o@@ bu Hash@@ imoto , who would survive Kuro@@ s@@ awa by 20 years and with whom he would eventually work on nine of his films .
their first joint effort was based on Ry@@ ū@@ no@@ su@@ ke Ak@@ ut@@ ag@@ awa &apos;s experimental short story &quot; In a Gro@@ ve , &quot; which re@@ counts the murder of a sam@@ u@@ rai and the rape of his wife from various different and conflicting points @-@ of @-@ view .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa saw potential in the script , and with Hash@@ imoto &apos;s help , polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Dai@@ ei , who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget .
shooting of &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; began on July 7 , 1950 , and , after extensive location work in the prim@@ eval forest of Nar@@ a , wrapped on August 17 .
just one week was spent in hurried post @-@ production , hampered by a studio fire , and the finished film premi@@ ered at Tokyo &apos;s Imperial Theatre on August 25 , expanding nationwide the following day .
the movie was met by lukewarm reviews , with many critics puzzled by its unique theme and treatment , but it was nevertheless a moderate financial success for Dai@@ ei .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s next film , for Sho@@ chi@@ ku , was &quot; The Idi@@ ot &quot; , an adaptation of the novel by the director &apos;s favorite writer , F@@ y@@ odor Do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky .
the film@@ maker relocated the story from Russia to Hokkaido , but it is otherwise very faithful to the original , a fact seen by many critics as detrimental to the work .
a studio @-@ mandated edit shortened it from Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s original cut of 265 minutes to just 166 minutes , making the resulting narrative exceedingly difficult to follow .
the severely edited film version is widely considered today to be one of the director &apos;s least successful works and the original full length version no longer exists .
contemporary reviews of the much shortened edited version were very negative , but the film was a moderate success at the box office , largely because of the popularity of one of its stars , Set@@ su@@ ko Har@@ a .
meanwhile , un@@ be@@ know@@ nst to Kuro@@ s@@ awa , &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; had been entered in the prestigious Venice Film Festival , due to the efforts of Gi@@ uli@@ ana Stra@@ mig@@ i@@ oli , a Japan @-@ based representative of an Italian film company , who had seen and admired the movie and convinced Dai@@ ei to submit it .
on September 10 , 1951 , &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; was awarded the festival &apos;s highest prize , the Golden Lion , shocking not only Dai@@ ei but the international film world , which at the time was largely unaware of Japan &apos;s decades @-@ old cin@@ ematic tradition .
after Dai@@ ei very briefly exhibited a sub@@ titled print of the film in Los Angeles , R@@ KO purchased distribution rights to &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; in the United States .
the company was taking a considerable gamble .
it had put out only one prior sub@@ titled film in the American market , and the only previous Japanese tal@@ kie commercially released in New York had been Mik@@ io Nar@@ use &apos;s comedy , &quot; Wife ! be Like a Rose &quot; , in 1937 : a critical and box @-@ office flop .
however , &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; s commercial run , greatly helped by strong reviews from critics and even the columnist Ed Sullivan , was very successful .
this success in turn led to a vogue in America and the West for Japanese movies throughout the 1950s , replacing the enthusiasm for Italian ne@@ or@@ eal@@ ist cinema .
for example , by the end of 1952 &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; was released in Japan , the United States , and most of Europe .
among the Japanese filmmakers whose work , as a result , began to win festival prizes and commercial release in the West were Ken@@ ji Miz@@ o@@ gu@@ chi and , somewhat later , Yasu@@ j@@ ir@@ ō Oz@@ u - artists highly respected in Japan but , prior to this period , almost totally unknown in the West .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s growing reputation among Western audiences in the 1950s would make Western audiences more sympathetic to the reception of later generations of Japanese filmmakers ranging from K@@ on I@@ chi@@ kawa , Mas@@ aki Kob@@ ay@@ ashi , Nag@@ isa O@@ shima and Sho@@ he@@ i Im@@ amura to Ju@@ zo I@@ tam@@ i , Tak@@ eshi Kit@@ ano and Tak@@ ashi Mi@@ ike .
his career boosted by his sudden international fame , Kuro@@ s@@ awa , now reunited with his original film studio , To@@ ho , set to work on his next project , &quot; I@@ kir@@ u &quot; .
the movie stars Tak@@ ashi Shim@@ ura as a cancer @-@ ridden Tokyo bureaucr@@ at , Watanabe , on a final quest for meaning before his death .
for the screen@@ play , Kuro@@ s@@ awa brought in Hash@@ imoto as well as writer H@@ ide@@ o O@@ gun@@ i , who would go on to co @-@ write 12 Kuro@@ s@@ awa films .
despite the work &apos;s grim subject matter , the screen@@ writers took a sati@@ rical approach , which some have compared to the work of Bre@@ cht , to both the bureaucratic world of its hero and the U.S. cultural colonization of Japan .
because of this strategy , the filmmakers are usually credited with saving the picture from the kind of senti@@ mentality common to dramas about characters with terminal illnesses . &quot;
I@@ kir@@ u &quot; opened in October 1952 to ra@@ ve reviews - it won Kuro@@ s@@ awa his second Kin@@ ema Jun@@ po &quot; Best Film &quot; award - and enormous box office success .
it remains the most acclaimed of all the artist &apos;s films set in the modern era .
in December 1952 , Kuro@@ s@@ awa took his &quot; I@@ kir@@ u &quot; screen@@ writers , Shin@@ o@@ bu Hash@@ imoto and H@@ ide@@ o O@@ gun@@ i , for a forty @-@ five @-@ day secluded residence at an inn to create the screen@@ play for his next movie , &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; .
the ensemble work was Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s first proper sam@@ u@@ rai film , the genre for which he would become most famous .
the simple story , about a poor farming village in S@@ eng@@ ok@@ u period Japan that hires a group of sam@@ u@@ rai to defend it against an impending attack by bandits , was given a full epic treatment , with a huge cast and meticulously detailed action , stretching out to almost three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours of screen time .
three months were spent in pre @-@ production and a month in rehear@@ sals .
shooting took up 148 days spread over almost a year , interrupted by production and financing troubles and Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s health problems .
the film finally opened in April 1954 , half a year behind its original release date and about three times over budget , making it at the time the most expensive Japanese film ever made . .
the film received positive critical reaction and became a big hit , quickly making back the money invested in it and providing the studio with a product that they could , and did , market internationally - though with extensive ed@@ its .
over time - and with the theatrical and home video releases of the un@@ cut version - its reputation has steadily grown .
it is now regarded by some commentators as the greatest Japanese film ever made , and in 1979 , a poll of Japanese film critics also voted it the best Japanese film ever made .
in the most recent version of the widely respected British Film Institute &quot; S@@ ight &amp; Sound &quot; &quot; Great@@ est Films of All Time &quot; poll , &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; placed 17th among all films from all countries in both the critics &apos; and the directors &apos; polls , receiving a place in the Top Ten lists of 48 critics and 22 directors .
in 1954 , nuclear tests in the Pacific were causing radioactive rain@@ storms in Japan and one particular incident in March had exposed a Japanese fishing boat to nuclear fallout , with disastrous results .
it is in this anxious atmosphere that Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s next film , &quot; Record of a Living Being &quot; , was conceived .
the story concerned an elderly factory owner so terrified of the prospect of a nuclear attack that he becomes determined to move his entire extended family to what he imag@@ ines is the safety of a farm in Brazil .
production went much more smoothly than the director &apos;s previous film , but a few days before shooting ended , Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s composer , collabor@@ ator and close friend F@@ um@@ io Hay@@ as@@ aka died at the age of 41 .
the film &apos;s score was finished by Hay@@ as@@ aka &apos;s student , Mas@@ ar@@ u Sa@@ to , who would go on to score all of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s next eight films . &quot;
record of a Living Being &quot; opened in November 1955 to mixed reviews and muted audience reaction , becoming the first Kuro@@ s@@ awa film to lose money during its original theatrical run .
today , it is considered by many to be among the finest films dealing with the psychological effects of the global nuclear stalemate .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s next project , &quot; Th@@ rone of Blood &quot; , an adaptation of William Shakespeare &apos;s &quot; Mac@@ beth &quot; - set , like &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; , in the S@@ eng@@ ok@@ u Era - represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa instructed his leading actress , I@@ su@@ zu Yamada , to regard the work as if it were a cin@@ ematic version of a &quot; Japanese &quot; rather than a European literary classic .
given Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s appreciation of traditional Japanese stage acting , the acting of the players , particularly Yamada , draws heavily on the sty@@ lized techniques of the No@@ h theater .
it was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been the case with the director &apos;s previous film .
abroad , &quot; Th@@ rone of Blood &quot; , regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material , quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations .
another adaptation of a classic European theatrical work followed almost immediately , with production of &quot; The Lower Dep@@ ths &quot; , based on a play by Max@@ im Gor@@ ky , taking place in May and June 1957 .
in contrast to the Shakespe@@ arean sweep of &quot; Th@@ rone of Blood &quot; , &quot; The Lower Dep@@ ths &quot; was shot on only two confined sets , in order to emphasize the restricted nature of the characters &apos; lives .
though faithful to the play , this adaptation of Russian material to a completely Japanese setting - in this case , the late E@@ do period - unlike his earlier &quot; The Idi@@ ot &quot; , was regarded as artis@@ tically successful .
the film premi@@ ered in September 1957 , receiving a mixed response similar to that of &quot; Th@@ rone of Blood &quot; .
however , some critics rank it among the director &apos;s most under@@ rated works .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s three consecutive movies after &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; had not managed to capture Japanese audiences in the way that that film had .
the mood of the director &apos;s work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and dark , with the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned , particularly in &quot; Th@@ rone of Blood &quot; and &quot; The Lower Dep@@ ths &quot; .
he recognized this , and deliberately aimed for a more light @-@ hearted and entertaining film for his next production , while switching to the new wides@@ cre@@ en format that had been gaining popularity in Japan .
the resulting film , &quot; The Hidden For@@ tress &quot; , is an action @-@ adventure comedy @-@ drama about a medieval princess , her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region .
released in December 1958 , &quot; The Hidden For@@ tress &quot; became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics both in Japan and abroad .
today , the film is considered one of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s most lightweight efforts , though it remains popular , not least because it is one of several major influences on George Lucas &apos;s 1977 space opera , &quot; Star Wars &quot; .
</p>
<p>
starting with &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; , Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s productions had become increasingly large in scope and so had the director &apos;s budgets .
To@@ ho , concerned about this development , suggested that he might help finance his own works , therefore making the studio &apos;s potential losses smaller , while in turn allowing himself more artistic freedom as co @-@ producer .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa agreed , and the Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production Company was established in April 1959 , with To@@ ho as majority shareholder .
despite risking his own money , Kuro@@ s@@ awa chose a story that was more directly critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work . &quot;
the Bad Sleep Well &quot; , based on a script by Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s nephew Mike In@@ ou@@ e , is a revenge drama about a young man who is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father &apos;s death .
its theme proved topical : while the film was in production , mass demonstrations were held against the new U.S.-@@ Japan Security treaty , which was seen by many Japanese , particularly the young , as threatening the country &apos;s democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians .
the film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success .
the 25 @-@ minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s most skillfully executed set pieces , but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison .
the movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kuro@@ saw@@ an hero to combat a social evil that cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals , however courageous or cunning . &quot;
Yo@@ j@@ im@@ bo &quot; , Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production &apos;s second film , centers on a master@@ less sam@@ u@@ rai , San@@ jur@@ o , who stro@@ l@@ ls into a 19th @-@ century town ruled by two opposing violent factions and provo@@ kes them into destroying each other .
the director used this work to play with many genre conventions , particularly the Western , while at the same time offering an unpreced@@ en@@ tedly graphic portrayal of violence .
some commentators have seen the San@@ jur@@ o character in this film as a fantasy figure who magically reverses the historical triumph of the corrupt merchant class over the sam@@ u@@ rai class .
featuring Tat@@ su@@ ya Nak@@ ad@@ ai in his first major role in a Kuro@@ s@@ awa movie , and with innovative photography by Kaz@@ uo Miy@@ ag@@ awa and Tak@@ ao Sai@@ to , the film premi@@ ered in April 1961 and was a critically and commercially successful venture , earning more than any previous Kuro@@ s@@ awa film .
the movie and its black@@ ly comic tone were also widely im@@ itated abroad .
Sergio Leone &apos;s &quot; A Fist@@ ful of Dollars &quot; was a virtual scene @-@ by @-@ scene remake with To@@ ho filing a lawsuit on Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s behalf and prevailing .
following the success of &quot; Yo@@ j@@ im@@ bo &quot; , Kuro@@ s@@ awa found himself under pressure from To@@ ho to create a sequel .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa turned to a script he had written before &quot; Yo@@ j@@ im@@ bo &quot; , re@@ working it to include the hero of his previous film . &quot;
San@@ jur@@ o &quot; was the first of three Kuro@@ s@@ awa films to be adapted from the work of the writer Sh@@ ū@@ gor@@ ō Yamamoto .
it is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than &quot; Yo@@ j@@ im@@ bo &quot; , though its story of a power struggle within a sam@@ u@@ rai clan is portrayed with strongly comic under@@ tones .
the film opened on January 1 , 1962 , quickly surpassing &quot; Yo@@ j@@ im@@ bo &quot; s box office success and gar@@ nering positive reviews .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa had meanwhile instructed To@@ ho to purchase the film rights to &quot; King &apos;s R@@ ans@@ om &quot; , a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screen@@ writer Evan Hunter , under his pseud@@ onym of Ed Mc@@ B@@ ain , as one of his 87th Prec@@ inc@@ t series of crime books .
the director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping , which he considered one of the very worst crimes .
the suspense film , titled &quot; High and Low &quot; , was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963 .
it broke Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s box office record , became the highest gro@@ ssing Japanese film of the year , and won glowing reviews .
however , his triumph was somewhat tarnished when , ironically , the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time . &quot;
high and Low &quot; is considered by many commentators to be among the director &apos;s strongest works .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa quickly moved on to his next project , &quot; Red Beard &quot; .
based on a short story collection by Sh@@ ū@@ gor@@ ō Yamamoto and incorporating elements from Do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky &apos;s novel &quot; The Insul@@ ted and Inju@@ red &quot; , it is a period film , set in a mid @-@ nineteenth century clinic for the poor , in which Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s humanist themes receive perhaps their fullest statement .
a conceited and materi@@ alistic , foreign @-@ trained young doctor , Yasu@@ mo@@ to , is forced to become an intern at the clinic under the stern tutel@@ age of Doctor Ni@@ ide , known as &quot; Ak@@ ah@@ ige &quot; , played by Mi@@ fun@@ e .
although he resists Red Beard initially , Yasu@@ mo@@ to comes to admire his wisdom and courage , and to perceive the patients at the clinic , whom he at first despised , as worthy of compassion and dignity .
Y@@ ū@@ z@@ ō Kay@@ ama , who plays Yasu@@ mo@@ to , was an extremely popular film and music star at the time , particularly for his &quot; Young Guy &quot; series of musical come@@ dies , so signing him to appear in the film virtually guaranteed Kuro@@ s@@ awa strong box @-@ office .
the shoot , the film@@ maker &apos;s longest ever , lasted well over a year , and wrapped in spring 1965 , leaving the director , his crew and his actors exhausted . &quot;
Red Beard &quot; premi@@ ered in April 1965 , becoming the year &apos;s highest @-@ gro@@ ssing Japanese production and the third Kuro@@ s@@ awa film to top the prestigious Kin@@ ema Jum@@ po yearly critics poll .
it remains one of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s best @-@ known and most @-@ loved works in his native country .
outside Japan , critics have been much more divided .
most commentators concede its technical merits and some praise it as among Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s best , while others insist that it lacks complexity and genuine narrative power , with still others claiming that it represents a retreat from the artist &apos;s previous commitment to social and political change .
the film marked something of an end of an era for its creator .
the director himself recognized this at the time of its release , telling critic Donald Ric@@ hie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods would be different .
his prediction proved quite accurate .
beginning in the late 1950s , television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience .
and as film company revenues dropped , so did their appetite for risk - particularly the risk represented by Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s costly production methods . &quot;
Red Beard &quot; also marked the midway point , chron@@ ologically , in the artist &apos;s career .
during his previous twenty @-@ nine years in the film industry , he had directed twenty @-@ three films , while during the remaining twenty @-@ eight years , for many and complex reasons , he would complete only seven more .
also , for reasons never adequately explained , &quot; Red Beard &quot; would be his final film starring To@@ shir@@ o Mi@@ fun@@ e .
Yu Fu@@ ji@@ ki , an actor who worked on &quot; The Lower Dep@@ ths &quot; , observed , regarding the closeness of the two men on the set , &quot; Mr. Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s heart was in Mr. Mi@@ fun@@ e &apos;s body . &quot; Donald Ric@@ hie has described the rapport between them as a unique &quot; symbio@@ sis . &quot;
</p>
<p>
when Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s exclusive contract with To@@ ho came to an end in 1966 , the 56 @-@ year @-@ old director was seriously contemplating change .
observing the troubled state of the domestic film industry , and having already received dozens of offers from abroad , the idea of working outside Japan appealed to him as never before .
for his first foreign project , Kuro@@ s@@ awa chose a story based on a &quot; Life &quot; magazine article .
the Embassy Pictures action thriller , to be filmed in English and called simply &quot; Run@@ away Train &quot; , would have been his first in color .
but the language barrier proved a major problem , and the English version of the screen@@ play was not even finished by the time filming was to begin in autumn 1966 .
the shoot , which required snow , was moved to autumn 1967 , then canceled in 1968 .
almost two decades later , another foreign director working in Hollywood , Andrei Kon@@ chal@@ ovsky , finally made &quot; Run@@ away Train &quot; , though from a new script loosely based on Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s .
the director meanwhile had become involved in a much more ambitious Hollywood project . &quot;
Tor@@ a ! Tor@@ a ! Tor@@ a ! &quot; , produced by 20th Century Fox and Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production , would be a portrayal of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor from both the American and the Japanese points @-@ of @-@ view , with Kuro@@ s@@ awa hel@@ ming the Japanese half and an English @-@ speaking film@@ maker directing the American half .
he spent several months working on the script with R@@ yu@@ zo Kik@@ ushima and H@@ ide@@ o O@@ gun@@ i , but very soon the project began to unravel .
the director chosen to film the American sequences turned out not to be the prestigious English film@@ maker David Lean , as the producers had led Kuro@@ s@@ awa to believe , but the much less celebrated special effects expert , Richard Fle@@ is@@ cher .
the budget was also cut , and the screen time allocated for the Japanese segment would now be no longer than 90 minutes - a major problem , considering that Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s script ran over four hours .
after numerous revisions with the direct involvement of Dar@@ r@@ yl Z@@ anu@@ ck , a more or less finalized cut screen@@ play was agreed upon in May 1968 .
shooting began in early December , but Kuro@@ s@@ awa would last only a little over three weeks as director .
he struggled to work with an unfamiliar crew and the requirements of a Hollywood production , while his working methods puzzled his American producers , who ultimately concluded that the director must be mentally ill .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa was examined at Kyoto University Hospital by a neuro@@ psychologist , Dr. Mu@@ rak@@ ami , whose diagnosis was forwarded to Dar@@ r@@ yl Z@@ anu@@ ck and Richard Z@@ anu@@ ck at Fox studios indicating a diagnosis of neu@@ ras@@ then@@ ia stating that , &quot; He is suffering from disturbance of sleep , agitated with feelings of anxiety and in manic excitement caused by the above mentioned illness . it is necessary for him to have rest and medical treatment for more than two months . &quot; on Christmas Eve 1968 , the Americans announced that Kuro@@ s@@ awa had left the production due to &quot; fatigue , &quot; effectively firing him .
he was ultimately replaced , for the film &apos;s Japanese sequences , with two directors , Kin@@ ji Fuk@@ as@@ aku and Toshi@@ o Ma@@ su@@ da . &quot;
Tor@@ a ! Tor@@ a ! Tor@@ a ! &quot; , finally released to un@@ enthusiastic reviews in September 1970 , was , as Donald Ric@@ hie put it , an &quot; almost un@@ mitigated tragedy &quot; in Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s career .
he had spent years of his life on a logistically night@@ mar@@ ish project to which he ultimately did not contribute a foot of film shot by himself .
he became estranged from his longtime collabor@@ ator , writer R@@ yu@@ zo Kik@@ ushima , and never worked with him again .
the project had inadvertently exposed corruption in his own production company .
his very sanity had been called into question .
worst of all , the Japanese film industry - and perhaps the man himself - began to suspect that he would never make another film .
</p>
<p>
knowing that his reputation was at stake following the much public@@ ised &quot; Tor@@ a ! Tor@@ a ! Tor@@ a ! &quot; debacle , Kuro@@ s@@ awa moved quickly to a new project to prove he was still viable .
to his aid came friends and famed directors Ke@@ is@@ u@@ ke Kin@@ o@@ sh@@ ita , Mas@@ aki Kob@@ ay@@ ashi and K@@ on I@@ chi@@ kawa , who together with Kuro@@ s@@ awa established in July 1969 a production company called the Club of the Four K@@ nights .
although the plan was for the four directors to create a film each , it has been suggested that the real motivation for the other three directors was to make it easier for Kuro@@ s@@ awa to successfully complete a film , and therefore find his way back into the business .
the first project proposed and worked on was a period film to be called &quot; D@@ ora @-@ He@@ ita &quot; , but when this was deemed too expensive , attention shifted to &quot; Do@@ de@@ su@@ kad@@ en &quot; , an adaptation of yet another Sh@@ ū@@ gor@@ ō Yamamoto work , again about the poor and destitute .
the film was shot quickly in about nine weeks , with Kuro@@ s@@ awa determined to show he was still capable of working quickly and efficiently within a limited budget .
for his first work in color , the dynamic editing and complex compositions of his earlier pictures were set aside , with the artist focusing on the creation of a bold , almost surreal palette of primary colors , in order to reveal the toxic environment in which the characters live .
it was released in Japan in October 1970 , but though a minor critical success , it was greeted with audience indifference .
the picture lost money and caused the Club of the Four K@@ nights to dissolve .
initial reception abroad was somewhat more favorable , but &quot; Do@@ de@@ su@@ kad@@ en &quot; has since been typically considered an interesting experiment not comparable to the director &apos;s best work .
unable to secure funding for further work and allegedly suffering from health problems , Kuro@@ s@@ awa apparently reached the breaking point : on December 22 , 1971 , he slit his wrists and throat multiple times .
the suicide attempt proved unsuccessful and the director &apos;s health recovered fairly quickly , with Kuro@@ s@@ awa now taking refuge in domestic life , uncertain if he would ever direct another film .
in early 1973 , the Soviet studio Mos@@ film approached the film@@ maker to ask if he would be interested in working with them .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa proposed an adaptation of Russian explorer Vladimir Arsen@@ yev &apos;s autobi@@ ographical work &quot; Der@@ su Uz@@ ala &quot; .
the book , about a Gol@@ di hunter who lives in harmony with nature until destroyed by encroaching civilization , was one that he had wanted to make since the 1930s .
in December 1973 , the 63 @-@ year @-@ old Kuro@@ s@@ awa set off for the Soviet Union with four of his closest aides , beginning a year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stay in the country .
shooting began in May 1974 in Siberia , with filming in exceedingly harsh natural conditions proving very difficult and demanding .
the picture wrapped in April 1975 , with a thoroughly exhausted and homesick Kuro@@ s@@ awa returning to Japan and his family in June . &quot;
Der@@ su Uz@@ ala &quot; had its world premiere in Japan on August 2 , 1975 , and did well at the box office .
while critical reception in Japan was muted , the film was better reviewed abroad , winning the Golden Prize at the 9th Moscow International Film Festival , as well as an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film .
today , critics remain divided over the film : some see it as an example of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s alleged artistic decline , while others count it among his finest works .
although proposals for television projects were submitted to him , he had no interest in working outside the film world .
nevertheless , the hard @-@ drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Sun@@ tory whiskey , which aired in 1976 .
while fearing that he might never be able to make another film , the director nevertheless continued working on various projects , writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations , intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he would never be able to film his stories .

<p>
in 1977 , American director George Lucas released &quot; Star Wars &quot; , a wildly successful science fiction film influenced by Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s &quot; The Hidden For@@ tress &quot; , among other works .
Lucas , like many other New Hollywood directors , revered Kuro@@ s@@ awa and considered him a role model , and was shocked to discover that the Japanese film@@ maker was unable to secure financing for any new work .
the two met in San Francisco in July 1978 to discuss the project Kuro@@ s@@ awa considered most financially viable :
&quot; Kag@@ em@@ usha &quot; , the epic story of a thief hired as the double of a medieval Japanese lord of a great clan .
Lucas , en@@ thr@@ alled by the screen@@ play and Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s illustrations , leveraged his influence over 20th Century Fox to coerce the studio that had fired Kuro@@ s@@ awa just ten years earlier to produce &quot; Kag@@ em@@ usha &quot; , then recruited fellow fan Francis Ford Cop@@ pol@@ a as co @-@ producer .
production began the following April , with Kuro@@ s@@ awa in high spirits .
shooting lasted from June 1979 through March 1980 and was plagued with problems , not the least of which was the firing of the original lead actor , Sh@@ int@@ aro Kat@@ su - creator of the very popular Z@@ ato@@ ichi character - due to an incident in which the actor insisted , against the director &apos;s wishes , on videot@@ aping his own performance .
the film was completed only a few weeks behind schedule and opened in Tokyo in April 1980 .
it quickly became a massive hit in Japan .
the film was also a critical and box office success abroad , winning the coveted Pal@@ me d &apos;@@ Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival in May , though some critics , then and now , have faulted the film for its alleged coldness .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa spent much of the rest of the year in Europe and America promoting &quot; Kag@@ em@@ usha &quot; , collecting awards and accol@@ ades , and exhibiting as art the drawings he had made to serve as story@@ boards for the film .
the international success of &quot; Kag@@ em@@ usha &quot; allowed Kuro@@ s@@ awa to proceed with his next project , &quot; R@@ an &quot; , another epic in a similar vein .
the script , partly based on William Shakespeare &apos;s &quot; King L@@ ear &quot; , depicted a ruthless , blood@@ thirsty &quot; d@@ aim@@ y@@ ō &quot; , played by Tat@@ su@@ ya Nak@@ ad@@ ai , who , after foolishly ban@@ ishing his one loyal son , surr@@ enders his kingdom to his other two sons , who then betray him , thus plunging the entire kingdom into war .
as Japanese studios still felt wary about producing another film that would rank among the most expensive ever made in the country , international help was again needed .
this time it came from French producer Serge Sil@@ ber@@ man , who had produced Luis Bu@@ ñ@@ uel &apos;s final movies .
filming did not begin until December 1983 and lasted more than a year .
in January 1985 , production of &quot; R@@ an &quot; was halted as Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s 64 @-@ year @-@ old wife Y@@ ō@@ ko fell ill .
she died on February 1 .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa returned to finish his film and &quot; R@@ an &quot; premi@@ ered at the Tokyo Film Festival on 31 May , with a wide release the next day .
the film was a moderate financial success in Japan , but a larger one abroad and , as he had done with &quot; Kag@@ em@@ usha &quot; , Kuro@@ s@@ awa embarked on a trip to Europe and America , where he attended the film &apos;s premi@@ eres in September and October . &quot;
ran &quot; won several awards in Japan , but was not quite as honored there as many of the director &apos;s best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been .
the film world was surprised , however , when Japan passed over the selection of &quot; R@@ an &quot; in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category , which was ultimately rejected for competition at the 58th Academy Awards .
both the producer and Kuro@@ s@@ awa himself attributed the failure to even submit &quot; R@@ an &quot; for competition to a misunderstanding : because of the Academy &apos;s ar@@ cane rules , no one was sure whether &quot; R@@ an &quot; qualified as a &quot; Japanese &quot; film , a &quot; French &quot; film , or both , so it was not submitted at all .
in response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snu@@ b by his own countrymen , the director Sid@@ ney Lum@@ et led a successful campaign to have Kuro@@ s@@ awa receive an Oscar nomination for Best Director that year . &quot;
ran &quot; s costume designer , Em@@ i W@@ ada , won the movie &apos;s only Oscar . &quot;
Kag@@ em@@ usha &quot; and &quot; R@@ an &quot; , particularly the latter , are often considered to be among Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s finest works .
after &quot; R@@ an &quot; s release , Kuro@@ s@@ awa would point to it as his best film , a major change of attitude for the director who , when asked which of his works was his best , had always previously answered &quot; my next one . &quot;
</p>
<p>
for his next movie , Kuro@@ s@@ awa chose a subject very different from any that he had ever filmed before .
while some of his previous pictures had included brief dream sequences , &quot; Dreams &quot; was to be entirely based upon the director &apos;s own dreams .
significantly , for the first time in over forty years , Kuro@@ s@@ awa , for this deeply personal project , wrote the screen@@ play alone .
although its estimated budget was lower than the films immediately preceding it , Japanese studios were still unwilling to back one of his productions , so Kuro@@ s@@ awa turned to another famous American fan , Steven Spi@@ elberg , who convinced Warner Bro@@ s. to buy the international rights to the completed film .
this made it easier for Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s son , His@@ ao , as co @-@ producer and soon @-@ to @-@ be head of Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production , to negotiate a loan in Japan that would cover the film &apos;s production costs .
shooting took more than eight months to complete , and &quot; Dreams &quot; premi@@ ered at Cannes in May 1990 to a polite but muted reception , similar to the reaction the picture would generate elsewhere in the world .
in 1990 , he accepted the Academy Award for Life@@ time Achievement .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa now turned to a more conventional story with &quot; R@@ hap@@ so@@ dy in August &quot; - the director &apos;s first film fully produced in Japan since &quot; Do@@ desk@@ ad@@ en &quot; over twenty years before - which explored the scars of the nuclear bombing which destroyed Nagasaki at the very end of World War II .
it was adapted from a Ki@@ y@@ oko Mur@@ ata novel , but the film &apos;s references to the Nagasaki bombing came from the director rather than from the book .
this was his only movie to include a role for an American movie star :
Richard G@@ ere , who plays a small role as the nephew of the elderly heroine .
shooting took place in early 1991 , with the film opening on 25 May that year to a largely negative critical reaction , especially in the United States , where the director was accused of promulgating na@@ ï@@ vely anti @-@ American sentiments , though Kuro@@ s@@ awa rejected these accusations .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa wasted no time moving onto his next project :
based on autobi@@ ographical essays by Hy@@ ak@@ ken U@@ ch@@ ida , the film follows the life of a Japanese professor of German through the Second World War and beyond .
the narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students , during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet - a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film &apos;s 81 @-@ year @-@ old creator .
filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September .
its release on April 17 , 1993 , was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction than had been the case with his two preceding works .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa nevertheless continued to work .
he wrote the original screen@@ plays &quot; The Sea is Wat@@ ching &quot; in 1993 and &quot; After the Rain &quot; in 1995 .
while putting finishing touches on the latter work in 1995 , Kuro@@ s@@ awa slipped and broke the base of his spine .
following the accident , he would use a wheelchair for the rest of his life , putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film .
his longtime wish - to die on the set while shooting a movie - was never to be fulfilled .
after his accident , Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s health began to deteriorate .
while his mind remained sharp and lively , his body was giving up , and for the last half @-@ year of his life , the director was largely confined to bed , listening to music and watching television at home .
on September 6 , 1998 , Kuro@@ s@@ awa died of a stroke in Set@@ ag@@ aya , Tokyo , at the age of 88 .
at the time of his death , Kuro@@ s@@ awa had two children , his son His@@ ao Kuro@@ s@@ awa who married Hiro@@ ko Hay@@ ashi and his daughter Kaz@@ u@@ ko Kuro@@ s@@ awa who married Har@@ ay@@ uki Ka@@ to , along with several grandchildren .
one of his grandchildren , the actor Tak@@ ay@@ uki Ka@@ to and , became a supporting actor in two films pos@@ thum@@ ously developed from screen@@ plays written by Kuro@@ s@@ awa which remained un@@ produced during his own lifetime , Tak@@ ashi Koizumi &apos;s &quot; After the Rain &quot; and K@@ ei Kum@@ ai &apos;s &quot; The Sea is Wat@@ ching &quot; .
</p>
<p>
from the beginning , Kuro@@ s@@ awa displayed a bold , dynamic style , strongly influenced by Western cinema yet quite distinct from it .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa was extensively involved with every aspect of film production .
he was also a gifted screen@@ writer , and would usually work in close collaboration with his co @-@ writers from the beginning of the development of a film to ensure a high @-@ quality script , which he insisted was the absolute foundation of a good film .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s style is marked by a number of devices and techniques which Kuro@@ s@@ awa introduced in his films over the decades .
in his films of the 1940s and 1950s , Kuro@@ s@@ awa frequently employs the &quot; axial cut , &quot; in which the camera moves closer to , or further away from , the subject , not through the use of tracking shots or dissolves , but through a series of matched jump cuts .
another stylistic trait which scholars have pointed out is Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s tendency to &quot; cut on motion &quot; : that is , to edit a sequence of a character or characters in motion so that an action is depicted in two or more separate shots , rather than one uninterrupted shot .
a form of cin@@ ematic punctuation very strongly identified with Kuro@@ s@@ awa is the wipe .
this is an effect created through an optical printer , in which , when a scene ends , a line or bar appears to move across the screen , &quot; wiping &quot; away the image while simultaneously revealing the first image of the subsequent scene .
as a transitional device , it is used as a substitute for the straight cut or the dissolve .
in his mature work , Kuro@@ s@@ awa employed the wipe so frequently that it became a kind of signature .
for example , one blogger has counted no fewer than 12 instances of the wipe in &quot; D@@ run@@ ken Angel &quot; .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa by all accounts always gave great attention to the sound@@ tracks of his films , especially with an emphasis on sound @-@ image counter@@ point , in which the music or sound effects would ironically comment upon the image rather than merely reinforcing it .
he was also involved with several of Japan &apos;s outstanding contemporary composers , including F@@ um@@ io Hay@@ as@@ aka and the internationally famous T@@ ō@@ ru Tak@@ em@@ it@@ su .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa employed a number of recurring major themes in his films .
these include : the master @-@ disciple relationship between a usually older mentor and one or more no@@ vices , which often involves spiritual as well as technical mastery and self @-@ mastery ; the heroic champion , the exceptional individual who emerges from the mass of people to produce something or right some injustice ; the depiction of extremes of weather as both dramatic devices and symbols of human passion ; and the recurrence of cycles of inexorable savage violence within history .
according to Stephen Prince , the latter theme began with &quot; Th@@ rone of Blood &quot; , and recur@@ red in Kuro@@ s@@ awa films of the 1980s .
Mr. Prince calls this theme &quot; the counter@@ tradition to the committed , heroic mode of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s cinema . &quot;
</p>
<p>
criticism of Kuro@@ s@@ awa in his legacy has significantly followed a close parity between the main currents of domestic criticism his films received when they were released in Japan with the international reception his individual films received when released abroad during his lifetime .
since the early to mid @-@ 1950s , a number of critics from the French New Wave championed the films of the older Japanese master , Ken@@ ji Miz@@ o@@ gu@@ chi , at the expense of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s work .
new Wave critic @-@ film@@ maker Jacques Ri@@ vette , said : &quot; you can compare only what is comparable and that which aims high enough ... &#91; Miz@@ o@@ gu@@ chi &#93; seems to be the only Japanese director who is completely Japanese and yet is also the only one that achieves a true universality , that of an individual . &quot; according to such French commentators , Miz@@ o@@ gu@@ chi seemed , of the two artists , the more authen@@ tically Japanese .
but at least one film scholar has questioned the validity of this dichotomy between &quot; Japanese &quot; Miz@@ o@@ gu@@ chi and &quot; Western &quot; Kuro@@ s@@ awa by pointing out that &quot; Miz@@ o &quot; had been at least as much influenced by Western cinema and Western culture in general as Kuro@@ s@@ awa had ever been , and that this awareness of foreign trends is reflected in his work .
in Japan , there have been critics and other filmmakers who have accused Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s work of el@@ itism , because of his focus on exceptional , heroic individuals and groups of men .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa always strongly denied pan@@ dering to Western tastes : &quot; he has never catered to a foreign audience &quot; writes Au@@ die B@@ ock , &quot; and has condemned those who do . &quot;
</p>
<p>
many celebrated directors have been influenced by Kuro@@ s@@ awa and have expressed admiration for his work .
the filmmakers cited below can be presented according to four categories : those who , like Kuro@@ s@@ awa himself , established international critical reputations in the 1950s and early 1960s ; the so @-@ called &quot; New Hollywood &quot; directors , that is , American movi@@ emakers who , for the most part , established their reputations in the early to mid @-@ 1970s ; other Asian directors ; and modern @-@ day directors .
the Swedish director Ing@@ mar Berg@@ man called his own film &quot; The Virgin Spring &quot; &quot; tour@@ istic , a lousy imitation of Kuro@@ s@@ awa , &quot; and added , &quot; At that time my admiration for the Japanese cinema was at its height . I was almost a sam@@ u@@ rai myself ! &quot; in Italy , Federico F@@ ell@@ ini in an interview declared the director &quot; the greatest living example of all that an author of the cinema should be &quot; - despite admitting to having seen only one of his films , &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; .
in France , Roman Pol@@ ans@@ ki in 1965 cited Kuro@@ s@@ awa as one of his three favorite filmmakers , singling out &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; , &quot; Th@@ rone of Blood &quot; and &quot; The Hidden For@@ tress &quot; for praise .
the Italian director Bernardo Ber@@ t@@ olu@@ cci considered the Japanese master &apos;s influence to be seminal :
&quot; Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s movies and &quot; La Dol@@ ce V@@ ita &quot; of F@@ ell@@ ini are the things that pushed me , sucked me into being a film director . &quot; German New Wave director Werner Herz@@ og has cited Kuro@@ s@@ awa as one of his greatest influences :
&quot; of the filmmakers with whom I feel some kinship , Griff@@ ith ... Bu@@ ñ@@ uel , Kuro@@ s@@ awa and Eisen@@ stein &apos;s &quot; Ivan the Ter@@ ri@@ ble &quot; , all come to mind . &quot; when asked to list his favorite directors , Russian director Andrei Tar@@ kov@@ sky cited Kuro@@ s@@ awa as one of his favorites and named &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; as one of his ten favorite films .
in his early years while still a television director , Robert Al@@ tman stated that when he first saw &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; he was so impressed by its cinem@@ at@@ ographer &apos;s achievement of shooting several shots with the camera aimed directly at the sun - allegedly it was the first film in which this was done successfully - that he claims he was inspired the very next day to begin incorporating shots of the sun into his television work .
it was Cop@@ pol@@ a who said of Kuro@@ s@@ awa , &quot; One thing that distinguishes &#91; him &#93; is that he didn &apos;t make one masterpiece or two masterpieces . he made , you know , &quot; eight &quot; masterpieces . &quot; both Spi@@ elberg and Scor@@ s@@ ese have praised the older man &apos;s role as teacher and role model , and Scor@@ s@@ ese called him his &quot; sen@@ sei &quot; , using the Japanese term .
Spi@@ elberg has declared , &quot; I have learned more from him than from almost any other film@@ maker on the face of the earth , &quot; while Scor@@ s@@ ese remarked , &quot; Let me say it simply : Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa was my master , and ... the master of so many other filmmakers over the years . &quot; several of these movi@@ emakers were also instrumental in helping Kuro@@ s@@ awa obtain financing for his late films :
Lucas and Cop@@ pol@@ a served as co @-@ producers on &quot; Kag@@ em@@ usha &quot; , while the Spi@@ elberg name , lent to the 1990 production , &quot; Dreams &quot; , helped bring that picture to fruition .
as the first Asian film@@ maker to achieve international prominence , Kuro@@ s@@ awa has naturally served as an inspiration for other Asian &quot; au@@ te@@ urs &quot; .
of &quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; , the most famous director of India , Sat@@ y@@ aj@@ it Ray , said :
&quot; the effect of the film on me &#91; upon first seeing it in Calcutta in 1952 &#93; was electric . I saw it three times on consecutive days , and wondered each time if there was another film anywhere which gave such sustained and dazzling proof of a director &apos;s command over every aspect of film making . &quot; other Asian admirers include the Japanese actor and director Tak@@ eshi Kit@@ ano , Hong Kong film@@ maker John Woo , Japanese anim@@ e director Hay@@ ao Miy@@ az@@ aki and mainland Chinese director Zhang Y@@ im@@ ou , who called Kuro@@ s@@ awa &quot; the quint@@ essential Asian director . &quot; even today , Kuro@@ s@@ awa continues to inspire and influence contemporary filmmakers .
Alexander Pay@@ ne spent the early part of his career watching Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s films , most notably &quot; Seven Samu@@ rai &quot; and &quot; I@@ kir@@ u &quot; .
Guillermo del Tor@@ o referred to Kuro@@ s@@ awa &quot; one of the essential masters , &quot; citing &quot; Th@@ rone of Blood &quot; , &quot; High and Low &quot; and &quot; R@@ an &quot; as among his favorite films .
Kath@@ ry@@ n Big@@ el@@ ow praised Kuro@@ s@@ awa as one of &quot; high @-@ impact filmmakers &quot; who can create emotionally invested characters .
J.@@ J. Abra@@ ms says he drew from Kuro@@ s@@ awa while making .
at the age of 19 , Alejandro González I@@ ñ@@ ár@@ rit@@ u remembers being spell@@ bound when he first saw &quot; I@@ kir@@ u &quot; and praises Kuro@@ s@@ awa as &quot; one of the first storytelling geni@@ uses who began to change the narrative structure of films . &quot; when Spi@@ ke Lee posted a list of 87 films every aspiring director should see , he included three Kuro@@ s@@ awa movies :
&quot; Rash@@ omon &quot; , &quot; Yo@@ j@@ im@@ bo &quot; and &quot; R@@ an &quot; .
</p>
<p>
following Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s death , several pos@@ thum@@ ous works based on his un@@ filmed screen@@ plays have been produced . &quot;
after the Rain &quot; , directed by Tak@@ ashi Koizumi , was released in 1999 , and &quot; The Sea is Wat@@ ching &quot; , directed by K@@ ei Kum@@ ai , premi@@ ered in 2002 .
a script created by the Yon@@ ki no Kai , around the time that &quot; Do@@ desk@@ ad@@ en &quot; was made , finally was filmed and released as &quot; D@@ ora @-@ He@@ ita &quot; , by the only surviving founding member of the club , K@@ on I@@ chi@@ kawa .
Hu@@ ayi Brothers Media and CK@@ F Pictures in China announced in 2017 plans to produce a film of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s pos@@ thum@@ ous screen@@ play of &quot; The Mas@@ que of the Black Death &quot; by Edgar Allan Po@@ e for 2020 .
Patrick Fr@@ ater writing for &quot; Vari@@ ety &quot; magazine in May 2017 stated that another two unfinished films by Kuro@@ s@@ awa were planned , with &quot; Sil@@ vering Sp@@ ear &quot; to start filming in 2018 .
</p>
<p>
in September 2011 , it was reported that remake rights to most of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s movies and un@@ produced screen@@ plays were assigned by the Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa 100 Project to the L.@@ A.@@ -based company Spl@@ end@@ ent .
splend@@ ent &apos;s chief Sak@@ iko Yamada , stated that he aimed to &quot; help contemporary film @-@ makers introduce a new generation of movi@@ ego@@ ers to these unforgettable stories . &quot; Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production Co . , established in 1959 , continues to oversee many of the aspects of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s legacy .
the director &apos;s son , His@@ ao Kuro@@ s@@ awa , is the current head of the company .
its American subsidiary , Kuro@@ s@@ awa Enterprises , is located in Los Angeles .
rights to Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s works were then held by Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production and the film studios under which he worked , most notably To@@ ho .
these rights were then assigned to the Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa 100 Project before being reassigned in 2011 to the L.@@ A. based company Spl@@ end@@ ent .
Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production works closely with the Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa Foundation , established in December 2003 and also run by His@@ ao Kuro@@ s@@ awa .
the foundation organizes an annual short film competition and spear@@ heads Kuro@@ s@@ awa @-@ related projects , including a recently shelved one to build a memorial museum for the director .
</p>
<p>
in 1981 , the Kuro@@ s@@ awa Film Studio was opened in Yokohama ; two additional locations have since been launched in Japan .
a large collection of archive material , including scanned screen@@ plays , photos and news articles , has been made available through the Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa Digital Archive , a Japanese proprietary website maintained by Ry@@ uk@@ ok@@ u University Digital Archives Research Center in collaboration with Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production .
An@@ a@@ heim University &apos;s Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa School of Film was launched in spring 2009 with the backing of Kuro@@ s@@ awa Production .
it offers online programs in digital film making , with headquarters in An@@ a@@ heim and a learning center in Tokyo .
two film awards have also been named in Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s honor .
the Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa Award for Life@@ time Achievement in Film Direc@@ ting is awarded during the San Francisco International Film Festival , while the Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa Award is given during the Tokyo International Film Festival .
in 1999 he was named &quot; Asian of the Century &quot; in the &quot; Arts , Literature , and Culture &quot; category by &quot; Asi@@ an@@ Week &quot; magazine and CNN , cited as &quot; one of the &#91; five &#93; people who contributed most to the betterment of Asia in the past 100 years . &quot; in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s birth in 2010 , a project called AK@@ 100 was launched in 2008 .
the AK@@ 100 Project aims to &quot; expose young people who are the representatives of the next generation , and all people everywhere , to the light and spirit of Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa and the wonderful world he created . &quot; An@@ a@@ heim University in cooperation with the Kuro@@ s@@ awa Family established the An@@ a@@ heim University Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa School of Film to offer online and blended learning programs on Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa and film@@ making .
the animated W@@ es Anderson film , &quot; Isle of D@@ ogs , &quot; is partially inspired by Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s filming techniques .
at the 64th Sydney Film Festival , there was a retrospective of Ak@@ ira Kuro@@ s@@ awa where films of his were screened to remember the great legacy he has created from his work .
</p>
<p>
a significant number of full @-@ length and short documentaries concerning the life and films of Kuro@@ s@@ awa were made during his lifetime and after his death . &quot;
A.@@ K. &quot; was filmed in 1985 and is a French documentary film directed by Chris Mar@@ ker .
though it was filmed while Kuro@@ s@@ awa was working on &quot; R@@ an &quot; , the film focuses more on Kuro@@ s@@ awa &apos;s remote but polite personality than on the making of the film .
the documentary is sometimes seen as being reflective of Mar@@ ker &apos;s fascination with Japanese culture , which he also drew on for one of his best @-@ known films , &quot; Sans Soleil &quot; .
the film was screened in the U@@ n Certain Reg@@ ard section at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival .

AB@@ BA are a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Ag@@ ne@@ tha F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og , B@@ jö@@ r@@ n Ul@@ va@@ eus , B@@ enny Ander@@ sson and Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d Lyn@@ g@@ stad .
the group &apos;s name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names .
they became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music , topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982 .
AB@@ BA won the Euro@@ vision Song Contest 1974 at The D@@ ome in Brighton , UK , giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest .
they are the most successful group to have taken part in the competition .
estimates of AB@@ BA &apos;s total record sales are around 140 million to 500 million records worldwide , making them one of the best @-@ selling music artists of all time .
AB@@ BA are the first group from a non @-@ English @-@ speaking country to achieve consistent success in the charts of English @-@ speaking countries , including the United Kingdom , Ireland , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , South Africa , and the United States .
they have a joint record eight consecutive number @-@ one albums in the UK .
the group also enjoyed significant success in Latin America , and recorded a collection of their hit songs in Spanish .
during the band &apos;s active years , it was composed of two couples , the one being Ag@@ ne@@ tha F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and B@@ jö@@ r@@ n Ul@@ va@@ eus , the other Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d Lyn@@ g@@ stad and B@@ enny Ander@@ sson .
with the increase of their popularity , their personal lives suffered which eventually resulted in the collapse of both marriages .
the relationship changes were reflected in the group &apos;s music , with latter compositions featuring darker and more intro@@ spective lyrics .
after AB@@ BA disbanded in December 1982 , Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus achieved success writing music for the stage , while Lyn@@ g@@ stad and F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og pursued solo careers with mixed success .
AB@@ BA &apos;s music declined in popularity until the purchase of AB@@ BA &apos;s catalogue and record company Polar by Poly@@ gram in 1989 enabled the groundwork to be laid for an international re @-@ issue of all their original material and a new Great@@ est H@@ its collection in September 1992 , which became a worldwide best@@ seller .
several films , notably &quot; Mu@@ riel &apos;s Wed@@ ding &quot; and &quot; The Ad@@ ventures of Pris@@ c@@ illa , Queen of the Desert &quot; , further revived interest in the group and spawned several tribute bands .
in 1999 , AB@@ BA &apos;s music was adapted into the successful musical &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia ! &quot; that toured worldwide .
a film of the same name , released in 2008 , became the highest @-@ gro@@ ssing film in the United Kingdom that year .
a sequel , &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia ! here We Go Again &quot; , was released in 2018 .
AB@@ BA were honoured at the of the Euro@@ vision Song Contest in 2005 , when their hit &quot; Waterloo &quot; was chosen as the best song in the competition &apos;s history .
the group was induc@@ ted into the Rock and Roll Hall of F@@ ame in 2010 .
in 2015 , their song &quot; D@@ ancing Queen &quot; was induc@@ ted into the Recording Academy &apos;s Gram@@ my Hall of F@@ ame .
on April 27 , 2018 , it was announced that the band had recorded two new songs after 35 years of being inactive , named &quot; I Still Have Faith in You &quot; and &quot; Don &apos;t Shu@@ t Me Down . &quot; on September 18 , 2018 , in an interview , Ander@@ sson said that they are still working on the songs , with possibly a third one written ; they are set to be released in 2019 .

<p>
B@@ enny Ander@@ sson became a member of a popular Swedish pop @-@ rock group , the H@@ ep Stars , that performed covers , amongst other things , of international hits .
the H@@ ep Stars were known as &quot; the Swedish Beatles . &quot; they also set up H@@ ep House , their equivalent of Apple Corps .
Ander@@ sson played the keyboard and eventually started writing original songs for his band , many of which became major hits , including &quot; No Response &quot; that hit number @-@ three in 1965 , &quot; Sun@@ ny Girl , &quot; &quot; Wed@@ ding , &quot; and &quot; Con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; all of which hit number @-@ one in 1966 .
Ander@@ sson also had a fruitful song@@ writing collaboration with L@@ asse Ber@@ gh@@ agen , with whom he wrote his first S@@ ven@@ sk@@ top@@ pen entry , &quot; S@@ agan om l@@ illa So@@ fie &quot; , in 1968 .
B@@ jö@@ r@@ n Ul@@ va@@ eus also began his musical career at 18 , when he fron@@ ted the Ho@@ ot@@ en@@ anny Sing@@ ers , a popular Swedish folk @-@ ski@@ ffle group .
Ul@@ va@@ eus started writing English @-@ language songs for his group , and even had a brief solo career alongside .
the Ho@@ ot@@ en@@ anny Sing@@ ers and the H@@ ep Stars sometimes crossed paths while touring .
in June 1966 , Ul@@ va@@ eus and Ander@@ sson decided to write a song together .
their first attempt was &quot; Isn &apos;t It Easy to Say , &quot; a song later recorded by the H@@ ep Stars .
Sti@@ g Anderson was the manager of the Ho@@ ot@@ en@@ anny Sing@@ ers and founder of the Polar Music label .
he saw potential in the collaboration , and encouraged them to write more .
the two also began playing occasionally with the other &apos;s bands on stage and on record , although it was not until 1969 that the pair wrote and produced some of their first real hits together :
&quot; l@@ ju@@ va sex@@ tit@@ al &quot; , recorded by Brit@@ a Borg , and the H@@ ep Stars &apos; 1969 hit &quot; Sp@@ el@@ eman &quot; .
Ander@@ sson wrote and submitted the song &quot; He@@ j , C@@ low@@ n &quot; for Mel@@ odi@@ festi@@ val@@ en 1969 , the national festival to select the Swedish entry to the Euro@@ vision Song Contest .
the song tied for first place , but re @-@ voting relegated Ander@@ sson &apos;s song to second place .
on that occasion Ander@@ sson briefly met his future spouse , singer Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d Lyn@@ g@@ stad , who also participated in the contest .
a month later , the two had become a couple .
as their respective bands began to break up during 1969 , Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus teamed up and recorded their first album together in 1970 , called &quot; Ly@@ c@@ ka &quot; , which included original songs sung by both men .
their spouses were often present in the recording studio , and sometimes added backing voc@@ als ; F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og even co @-@ wrote a song with the two .
Ul@@ va@@ eus still occasionally recorded and performed with the Ho@@ ot@@ en@@ anny Sing@@ ers until the middle of 1974 , and Ander@@ sson took part in producing their records .
Ag@@ ne@@ tha F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og sang with a local dance band headed by Ber@@ nt En@@ gh@@ ard@@ t who sent a demo recording of the band to Karl Gerhard Lund@@ k@@ vist .
the demo tape featured a song written and sung by Ag@@ ne@@ tha : &quot; J@@ AG var s@@ å k@@ ä@@ r &quot; .
Lund@@ k@@ vist was so impressed with her voice that he was convinced she would be a star .
after going through considerable effort to locate the singer , he arranged for Ag@@ ne@@ tha to come to Stockholm and to record two of her own songs .
this led to Ag@@ ne@@ tha at the age of 18 having a number @-@ one record in Sweden with a self @-@ composed song , which later went on to sell over 80,000 copies .
she was soon noticed by the critics and song@@ writers as a talented singer / song@@ writer of sch@@ l@@ ager style songs .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og &apos;s main inspiration in her early years were singers such as Connie Francis .
along with her own compositions , she recorded covers of foreign hits and performed them on tours in Swedish folk@@ parks .
most of her biggest hits were self @-@ composed , which was quite unusual for a female singer in the 1960s .
Ag@@ ne@@ tha released four solo L@@ Ps between 1968 and 1971 .
she had many successful singles in the Swedish charts .
during filming of a Swedish TV special in May 1969 , F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og met Ul@@ va@@ eus , and they married on 6 July 1971 .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and Ul@@ va@@ eus eventually were involved in each other &apos;s recording sessions , and soon even Ander@@ sson and Lyn@@ g@@ stad added backing voc@@ als to F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og &apos;s third studio album , &quot; S@@ om ja@@ g ä@@ r &quot; .
in 1972 , F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og star@@ red as Mary Magdal@@ ene in the original Swedish production of &quot; Jesus Christ Super@@ star &quot; and attracted favourable reviews .
between 1967 and 1975 , F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og released five studio albums .
Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d &quot; Fri@@ da &quot; Lyn@@ g@@ stad sang from the age of 13 with various dance bands , and worked mainly in a jazz @-@ oriented cab@@ aret style .
she also formed her own band , the Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d Four .
in the middle of 1967 , she won a national talent competition with &quot; En le@@ dig dag &quot; a Swedish version of the bo@@ ssa nova song &quot; A Day in Por@@ to@@ fin@@ o , &quot; which is included in the EMI compilation &quot; Fri@@ da 1967 @-@ 1972 &quot; .
the first prize was a recording contract with EMI Sweden and to perform live on the most popular TV shows in the country .
this TV performance , amongst many others , is included in the 3 @-@ hour documentary &quot; Fri@@ da - The DVD &quot; .
Lyn@@ g@@ stad released several sch@@ l@@ ager style singles on EMI without much success .
when B@@ enny Ander@@ sson started to produce her recordings in 1971 , she had her first number @-@ one single , &quot; Min eg@@ en stad &quot; , written by B@@ enny and featuring all the future AB@@ BA members on backing voc@@ als .
Lyn@@ g@@ stad toured and performed regularly in the folk@@ park circuit and made appearances on radio and TV .
she met Ul@@ va@@ eus briefly in 1963 during a talent contest , and F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og during a TV show in early 1968 .
Lyn@@ g@@ stad linked up with her future band@@ mates in 1969 .
on 1 March 1969 , she participated in the Mel@@ odi@@ festival , where she met Ander@@ sson for the first time .
a few weeks later they met again during a concert tour in southern Sweden and they soon became a couple .
Ander@@ sson produced her single &quot; Peter Pan &quot; in September 1969 &amp; m@@ dash ; her first collaboration with B@@ enny &amp; B@@ jö@@ r@@ n , as they had written the song .
Ander@@ sson would then produce Lyn@@ g@@ stad &apos;s debut studio album , &quot; Fri@@ da &quot; , which was released in March 1971 .
Lyn@@ g@@ stad also played in several rev@@ ues and cab@@ aret shows in Stockholm between 1969 and 1973 .
after AB@@ BA formed , she recorded another successful album in 1975 , &quot; Fri@@ da ens@@ am &quot; , which included a Swedish rendition of &quot; Fernando , &quot; a hit on the Swedish radio charts before the English version was released .
</p>
<p>
an attempt at combining their talents occurred in April 1970 when the two couples went on holiday together to the island of Cyprus .
what started as singing for fun on the beach ended up as an improvised live performance in front of the United Nations soldiers stationed on the island .
Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus were at this time recording their first album together , &quot; Ly@@ c@@ ka &quot; , which was to be released in September 1970 .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and Lyn@@ g@@ stad added backing voc@@ als on several tracks during June , and the idea of their working together saw them launch a stage act , &quot; F@@ est@@ fol@@ ket &quot; , on 1 November 1970 in Go@@ then@@ burg .
the cab@@ aret show attracted generally negative reviews , except for the performance of the Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus hit &quot; He@@ j , gam@@ le man &quot; -the first B@@ jö@@ r@@ n and B@@ enny recording to feature all four .
they also performed solo numbers from respective albums , but the lukewarm reception convinced the four@@ some to shel@@ ve plans for working together for the time being , and each soon concentrated on individual projects again .
</p>
<p>
&quot; He@@ j , gam@@ le man , &quot; a song about an old Salvation Army soldier , became the quartet &apos;s first hit .
the record was credited to B@@ jö@@ r@@ n &amp; B@@ enny and reached number five on the sales charts and number one on S@@ ven@@ sk@@ top@@ pen , staying there for 15 weeks .
it was during 1971 that the four artists began working together more , adding voc@@ als to the others &apos; recordings .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og , Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus toured together in May , while Lyn@@ g@@ stad toured on her own .
frequent recording sessions brought the four@@ some closer together during the summer .
</p>
<p>
after the 1970 release of &quot; Ly@@ c@@ ka &quot; , two more singles credited to &quot; B@@ jö@@ r@@ n &amp; B@@ enny &quot; were released in Sweden , &quot; D@@ et kan ingen do@@ ktor h@@ j@@ ä@@ l@@ pa &quot; and &quot; T@@ än@@ k om j@@ ord@@ en vor@@ e ung &quot; , with more prominent voc@@ als by F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and Lyn@@ g@@ stad @-@ and moderate chart success .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and Ul@@ va@@ eus , now married , started performing together with Ander@@ sson on a regular basis at the Swedish folk@@ parks in the middle of 1971 .
Sti@@ g Anderson , founder and owner of Polar Music , was determined to break into the mainstream international market with music by Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus .
&quot; one day the pair of you will write a song that becomes a worldwide hit , &quot; he predicted .
Sti@@ g Anderson encouraged Ul@@ va@@ eus and Ander@@ sson to write a song for Mel@@ odi@@ festi@@ val@@ en , and after two rejected entries in 1971 , Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus submitted their new song &quot; S@@ ä@@ g det med en s@@ å@@ ng &quot; for the 1972 contest , choosing newcomer L@@ ena Anderson to perform .
the song came in third place , encouraging Sti@@ g Anderson , and became a hit in Sweden .
the first signs of foreign success came as a surprise , as the Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus single &quot; She &apos;s My Kind of Girl &quot; was released through Ep@@ ic Records in Japan in March 1972 , giving the duo a Top 10 hit .
two more singles were released in Japan , &quot; En Car@@ ous@@ el &quot; and &quot; Love Has Its Ways &quot; .
</p>
<p>
Ul@@ va@@ eus and Ander@@ sson persever@@ ed with their song@@ writing and experimented with new sounds and vocal arrangements .
&quot; people Need Love &quot; was released in June 1972 , featuring guest voc@@ als by the women , who were now given much greater prominence .
Sti@@ g Anderson released it as a single , credited to &quot; B@@ jö@@ r@@ n &amp; B@@ enny , Ag@@ ne@@ tha &amp; Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d &quot; .
the song peaked at number 17 in the Swedish combined single and album charts , enough to convince them they were on to something .
the single also became the first record to chart for the quartet in the United States , where it peaked at number 114 on the &quot; C@@ ash@@ box &quot; singles chart and number 117 on the &quot; Record World &quot; singles chart .
labeled as &quot; B@@ jö@@ r@@ n &amp; B@@ enny &quot; , it was released there through Playboy Records .
however , according to Sti@@ g Anderson , &quot; People Need Love &quot; could have been a much bigger American hit , but a small label like Playboy Records did not have the distribution resources to meet the demand for the single from retailers and radio programmers .
the four@@ some decided to record their first album together in late 1972 , and sessions began on 26 September 1972 .
the women shared lead voc@@ als on &quot; Nina , Pret@@ ty B@@ aller@@ ina &quot; that day , and their voices in harmony for the first time gave the four@@ some an idea of the quality of their combined talents .
</p>
<p>
in 1973 , the band and their manager Sti@@ g Anderson decided to have another try at Mel@@ odi@@ festi@@ val@@ en , this time with the song &quot; Ring Ring . &quot; the studio sessions were handled by Michael B. T@@ ret@@ ow , who experimented with a &quot; wall of sound &quot; production technique that became the wholly new sound .
Sti@@ g Anderson arranged an English translation of the lyrics by Neil Sed@@ aka and Phil Co@@ dy and they thought this would be a sure@@ fire winner .
however , on 10 February 1973 , the song came third in Mel@@ odi@@ festi@@ val@@ en ; thus it never reached the Euro@@ vision Song Contest itself .
nevertheless , the group released their debut studio album , also called &quot; Ring Ring &quot; .
the album did well and the &quot; Ring Ring &quot; single was a hit in many parts of Europe and also in South Africa .
however , Sti@@ g Anderson felt that the true breakthrough could only come with a UK or US hit .
when Ag@@ ne@@ tha F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og gave birth to her daughter Linda in 1973 , she was replaced for a short period by In@@ ger Brun@@ din on a trip to West Germany .
</p>
<p>
in 1973 , Sti@@ g Anderson , tired of unwieldy names , started to refer to the group privately and publicly as AB@@ BA .
at first , this was a play on words , as Ab@@ ba is also the name of a well @-@ known fish @-@ canning company in Sweden , and itself an acronym .
however , since the fish @-@ cann@@ ers were unknown outside Sweden , Anderson came to believe the name would work in international markets .
a competition to find a suitable name for the group was held in a Go@@ then@@ burg newspaper and it was officially announced in the summer that the group were to be known as &quot; AB@@ BA . &quot; the group negotiated with the cann@@ ers for the rights to the name .
&quot; AB@@ BA &quot; is an acronym formed from the first letters of each group member &apos;s first name : Ag@@ ne@@ tha , B@@ jö@@ r@@ n , B@@ enny , and Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d .
the earliest known example of &quot; AB@@ BA &quot; written on paper is on a recording session sheet from the Me@@ tr@@ on@@ ome Studio in Stockholm dated 16 October 1973 .
this was first written as &quot; B@@ jö@@ r@@ n , B@@ enny , Ag@@ ne@@ tha &amp; Fri@@ da , &quot; but was subsequently crossed out with &quot; AB@@ BA &quot; written in large letters on top .
</p>
<p>
when Universal Music purchased Poly@@ Gra@@ m , control of the group &apos;s catalogue was returned to Stockholm .
since then , the original logo has been reinstated on all official products .
</p>
<p>
as the group entered the Mel@@ odi@@ festi@@ val@@ en with &quot; Ring Ring &quot; but failed to qualify as the 1973 Swedish entry , Sti@@ g Anderson immediately started planning for the 1974 contest .
Ul@@ va@@ eus , Ander@@ sson and Sti@@ g Anderson believed in the possibilities of using the Euro@@ vision Song Contest as a way to make the music business aware of them as song@@ writers , as well as the band itself .
in late 1973 , they were invited by Swedish television to contribute a song for the Mel@@ odi@@ festi@@ val@@ en 1974 and from a number of new songs , the upbeat song &quot; Waterloo &quot; was chosen ; the group was now inspired by the growing gl@@ am rock scene in England .
AB@@ BA won their national heats on Swedish television on 9 February 1974 , and with this third attempt were far more experienced and better prepared for the Euro@@ vision Song Contest .
winning the 1974 Contest on 6 April 1974 gave AB@@ BA the chance to tour Europe and perform on major television shows ; thus the band saw the &quot; Waterloo &quot; single chart in many European countries .
&quot; Waterloo &quot; was AB@@ BA &apos;s first number @-@ one single in big markets such as the UK and West Germany .
in the United States , the song peaked at number @-@ six on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 chart , paving the way for their first album and their first trip as a group there .
albeit a short promotional visit , it included their first performance on American television , &quot; The Mike Douglas Show &quot; .
the album &quot; Waterloo &quot; only peaked at number 145 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; 200 chart , but received unanimous high praise from the US critics :
&quot; Los Angeles Times &quot; called it &quot; a compelling and fascinating debut album that captures the spirit of mainstream pop quite effectively ... an immensely enjoyable and pleasant project , &quot; while &quot; Cre@@ em &quot; characterised it as &quot; a perfect blend of exceptional , lovable compositions . &quot; AB@@ BA &apos;s follow @-@ up single , &quot; Honey , Honey , &quot; peaked at number 27 on the US &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 , and was a number @-@ two hit in West Germany .
however , in the United Kingdom , AB@@ BA &apos;s British record label , Ep@@ ic , decided to re @-@ release a re@@ mixed version of &quot; Ring Ring &quot; instead of &quot; Honey , Honey , &quot; and a cover version of the latter by Sweet Dreams peaked at number 10 .
both records debu@@ ted on the UK chart within one week of each other .
&quot; ring Ring &quot; failed to reach the Top 30 in the United Kingdom , increasing growing speculation that the group was simply a Euro@@ vision one @-@ hit wonder .
</p>
<p>
in November 1974 , AB@@ BA embarked on their first European tour , playing dates in Denmark , West Germany and Austria .
it was not as successful as the band had hoped , since most of the venues did not sell out .
due to a lack of demand , they were even forced to cancel a few shows , including a sole concert scheduled in Switzerland .
the second leg of the tour , which took them through Scandinavia in January 1975 , was very different .
they played to full houses everywhere and finally got the reception they had aimed for .
live performances continued in the middle of 1975 when AB@@ BA embarked on a fourteen open @-@ air date tour of Sweden and Finland .
their Stockholm show at the Gr@@ ö@@ na Lund amusement park had an estimated audience of 19,@@ 200 .
B@@ jö@@ r@@ n Ul@@ va@@ eus later said that &quot; If you look at the singles we released straight after Waterloo , we were trying to be more like the Sweet , a semi @-@ gl@@ am rock group , which was stupid because we were always a pop group . &quot; in late 1974 , &quot; So Long &quot; was released as a single in the United Kingdom but it received no air@@ play from Radio 1 and failed to chart .
later that year , the release of their self @-@ titled third studio album &quot; AB@@ BA &quot; and single &quot; SOS &quot; brought back their chart presence in the UK , where the single hit number six and the album peaked at number 13 .
&quot; SOS &quot; also became AB@@ BA &apos;s second number @-@ one single in Germany and their third in Australia .
success was further solidified with &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia &quot; reaching number @-@ one in the United Kingdom , Germany and Australia .
in the United States , &quot; SOS &quot; peaked at number 10 on the Record World Top 100 singles chart and number 15 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 chart , picking up the BMI Award along the way as one of the most played songs on American radio in 1975 .
the success of the group in the United States had until that time been limited to single releases .
by early 1976 , the group already had four Top 30 singles on the US charts , but the album market proved to be tough to crack .
the ep@@ onymous &quot; AB@@ BA &quot; album generated three American hits , but it only peaked at number 165 on the &quot; C@@ ash@@ box &quot; album chart and number 174 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; 200 chart .
opinions were voiced , by &quot; Cre@@ em &quot; in particular , that in the US AB@@ BA had endured &quot; a very sloppy promotional campaign . &quot; nevertheless , the group enjoyed warm reviews from the American press . &quot;
C@@ ash@@ box &quot; went as far as saying that &quot; there is a recurrent thread of taste and arti@@ stry inherent in Ab@@ ba &apos;s marketing , creativity and presentation that makes it almost embarrassing to critique their efforts , &quot; while &quot; Cre@@ em &quot; wrote :
&quot; SOS is surrounded on this LP by so many good tunes that the mind bo@@ ggles . &quot; in Australia , the airing of the music videos for &quot; I Do , I Do , I Do , I Do , I Do &quot; and &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia &quot; on the nationally broadcast TV pop show &quot; Coun@@ tdown &quot; saw the band rapidly gain enormous popularity , and &quot; Coun@@ tdown &quot; become a key promoter of the group via their distinctive music videos .
this started an immense interest for AB@@ BA in Australia , resulting in both the single and album holding down the No. 1 positions on the charts for months .
</p>
<p>
in March 1976 , the band released the compilation album &quot; Great@@ est H@@ its &quot; .
it became their first UK number @-@ one album , and also took AB@@ BA into the Top 50 on the US album charts for the first time , eventually selling more than a million copies there .
at the same time , Germany released a compilation named &quot; The Very Best of AB@@ BA &quot; , also becoming a number @-@ one album there whereas the &quot; Great@@ est H@@ its &quot; compilation followed a few months later to number @-@ two on the German charts , despite all similarities with &quot; The Very Best &quot; album .
also included on &quot; Great@@ est H@@ its &quot; was a new single , &quot; Fernando , &quot; which went to number @-@ one in at least thirteen countries worldwide , including the United Kingdom , Germany and Australia , and the single went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide .
in Australia , the song occupied the top position for 14 weeks , tying with the Beatles &apos; &quot; Hey J@@ ude &quot; for longest @-@ running number @-@ one , and making &quot; Fernando &quot; one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time in Australia .
that same year , the group received its first international prize , with &quot; Fernando &quot; being chosen as the &quot; Best Studio Recording of 1975 . &quot; in the United States , &quot; Fernando &quot; reached the Top 10 of the C@@ ash@@ box Top 100 singles chart and number 13 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 .
it also topped the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Adult Contemporary chart , AB@@ BA &apos;s first American number @-@ one single on any chart .
the group &apos;s fourth studio album , &quot; Ar@@ rival &quot; , a number @-@ one best @-@ seller in Europe and Australia , represented a new level of accomplishment in both song@@ writing and studio work , prompting ra@@ ve reviews from more rock @-@ oriented UK music week@@ lies such as &quot; Mel@@ ody M@@ aker &quot; and &quot; New Mus@@ ical Express &quot; , and mostly appreciative notices from US critics .
hit after hit flowed from &quot; Ar@@ rival &quot; :
&quot; money , Money , Money , &quot; another number @-@ one in Germany and Australia , and &quot; Know@@ ing Me , Know@@ ing You , &quot; AB@@ BA &apos;s sixth consecutive German number @-@ one as well as another UK number @-@ one .
the real sensation was &quot; D@@ ancing Queen , &quot; not only topping the charts in loyal markets the UK , Germany and Australia , but also reaching number @-@ one in the United States .
in South Africa , AB@@ BA had astounding success with &quot; Fernando , &quot; &quot; D@@ ancing Queen &quot; and &quot; Know@@ ing Me , Know@@ ing You &quot; being among the top 20 best @-@ selling singles for 1976 @-@ 77 .
in 1977 , &quot; Ar@@ rival &quot; was nominated for the inaugural BRI@@ T Award in the category &quot; Best International Album of the Year . &quot; by this time AB@@ BA were popular in the United Kingdom , most of Western Europe , Australia and New Zealand .
in &quot; Fri@@ da - The DVD &quot; , Lyn@@ g@@ stad explains how she and F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og developed as singers , as AB@@ BA &apos;s recordings grew more complex over the years .
the band &apos;s popularity in the United States would remain on a comparatively smaller scale , and &quot; D@@ ancing Queen &quot; became the only &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 number @-@ one single AB@@ BA had there .
nevertheless , &quot; Ar@@ rival &quot; finally became a true breakthrough release for AB@@ BA on the US album market where it peaked at number 20 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; 200 chart and was certified gold by R@@ IAA .
</p>
<p>
in January 1977 , AB@@ BA embarked on their first major tour .
the group &apos;s status had changed dramatically and they were clearly regarded as super@@ stars .
they opened their much anticipated tour in Oslo , Norway , on 28 January , and mounted a lav@@ ishly produced spectacle that included a few scenes from their self @-@ written mini @-@ oper@@ etta &quot; The Girl with the Golden Hair &quot; .
the concert attracted immense media attention from across Europe and Australia .
they continued the tour through Western Europe , visiting Go@@ then@@ burg , Copenhagen , Berlin , Cologne , Amsterdam , Antwerp , Es@@ sen , Han@@ over , and Hamburg and ending with shows in the United Kingdom in Manchester , Birmingham , Glasgow and two sold @-@ out concerts at London &apos;s Royal Albert Hall .
tickets for these two shows were available only by mail application and it was later revealed that the box @-@ office received 3.5 million requests for tickets , enough to fill the venue 580 times .
along with praise , there were complaints that &quot; AB@@ BA performed slic@@ kly ... but with a zero personality coming across from a total of 16 people on stage &quot; .
one of the Royal Albert Hall concerts was filmed as a reference for the filming of the Australian tour for what became &apos; , though it is not exactly known how much of the concert was filmed .
after the European leg of the tour , in March 1977 , AB@@ BA played 11 dates in Australia before a total of 160,000 people .
the opening concert in Sydney at the Sydney Show@@ ground on 3 March to an audience of 20,000 was marred by torrential rain with Lyn@@ g@@ stad slipping on the wet stage during the concert .
however , all four members would later recall this concert as the most memorable of their career .
upon their arrival in Melbourne , a civic reception was held at the Melbourne Town Hall and AB@@ BA appeared on the balcony to greet an enthusiastic crowd of 6,000 .
in Melbourne , the group played three concerts at the Sid@@ ney M@@ yer Music Bowl with 14,@@ 500 at each including the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and his family .
at the first Melbourne concert , an additional 16,000 people gathered outside the fenced @-@ off area to listen to the concert .
in Adel@@ aide , the group performed one concert at West Lakes Football Stadium in front of 20,000 people , with another 10,000 listening outside .
during the first of five concerts in Perth , there was a bomb scare with everyone having to evacuate the Entertainment Centre .
the trip was accompanied by mass hysteria and unprecedented media attention , and is captured on film in &apos; , directed by L@@ asse Hall@@ ström .
the Australian tour and its subsequent &quot; AB@@ BA : the Movie &quot; produced some AB@@ BA lore , as well .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og &apos;s blonde good looks had long made her the band &apos;s &quot; pin @-@ up girl , &quot; a role she disd@@ ained .
during the Australian tour , she performed in a skin @-@ tight white jum@@ p@@ suit , causing one Australian newspaper to use the headline &quot; Ag@@ ne@@ tha &apos;s bottom tops dull show . &quot; when asked about this at a news conference , she replied :
&quot; don &apos;t they have bottoms in Australia ? &quot; in December 1977 , AB@@ BA followed up &quot; Ar@@ rival &quot; with the more ambitious fifth album &quot; &quot; , released to coincide with the debut of &quot; AB@@ BA : the Movie &quot; .
although the album was less well received by UK reviewers , it did spawn more worldwide hits :
&quot; the Name of the Game &quot; and &quot; Take a Chance on Me , &quot; which both topped the UK charts , and peaked at number 12 and number three , respectively , on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 chart in the US .
although &quot; Take a Chance on Me &quot; did not top the American charts , it proved to be AB@@ BA &apos;s biggest hit single there , selling more copies than &quot; D@@ ancing Queen . &quot; &quot; the Album &quot; also included &quot; Thank You for the Music , &quot; the B @-@ side of &quot; Eagle &quot; in countries where the latter had been released as a single , and was bel@@ atedly released as an A @-@ side single in the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1983 .
&quot; thank You for the Music &quot; has become one of the best loved and best known AB@@ BA songs without being released as a single during the group &apos;s lifetime .
</p>
<p>
by 1978 AB@@ BA were one of the biggest bands in the world .
they converted a vacant cinema into the Polar Music Studio , a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art studio in Stockholm .
the studio was used by several other bands ; notably Genesis &apos; &quot; Duke &quot; and L@@ ed Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ in &apos;s &quot; In Through the Out Door &quot; were recorded there .
during May , the group went to the United States for a promotional campaign , performing alongside Andy Gib@@ b on Olivia Newton @-@ John &apos;s TV show .
recording sessions for the single &quot; Summer Night City &quot; were an uphill struggle , but upon release the song became another hit for the group .
the track would set the stage for AB@@ BA &apos;s for@@ ay into disco with their next album .
on 9 January 1979 , the group performed &quot; Chi@@ qu@@ iti@@ ta &quot; at the Music for UNICEF Concert held at the United Nations General Assembly to celebrate UNICEF &apos;s Year of the Child .
AB@@ BA donated the copyright of this worldwide hit to the UNICEF ; see Music for UNICEF Concert .
the single was released the following week , and reached number @-@ one in ten countries .
</p>
<p>
in mid @-@ January 1979 , Ul@@ va@@ eus and F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og announced they were getting divorced .
the news caused interest from the media and led to speculation about the band &apos;s future .
AB@@ BA assured the press and their fan base they were continuing their work as a group and that the divorce would not affect them .
nonetheless , the media continued to confront them with this in interviews .
to escape the media swirl and concentrate on their writing , Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus secretly travelled to Com@@ pass Point Stu@@ di@@ os in Nass@@ au , Bahamas , where for two weeks they prepared their next album &apos;s songs .
the group &apos;s sixth studio album , &quot; V@@ ou@@ lez @-@ V@@ ous &quot; , was released in April 1979 , the title track of which was recorded at the famous Criteria Stu@@ di@@ os in Miami , Florida , with the assistance of recording engineer Tom Dow@@ d amongst others .
the album topped the charts across Europe and in Japan and Mexico , hit the Top 10 in Canada and Australia and the Top 20 in the United States .
none of the singles from the album reached number @-@ one on the UK charts , but &quot; Chi@@ qu@@ iti@@ ta , &quot; &quot; Does Your Mother Know , &quot; &quot; Angel@@ eyes &quot; and &quot; I Have a Dream &quot; were all UK Top 5 hits .
in Canada , &quot; I Have a Dream &quot; became AB@@ BA &apos;s second number @-@ one on the R@@ PM Adult Contemporary chart .
also in 1979 , the group released their second compilation album , &quot; Great@@ est H@@ its Vol . 2 &quot; , which featured a brand new track :
&quot; G@@ im@@ me ! G@@ im@@ me ! G@@ im@@ me ! , &quot; another number @-@ three hit in both the UK and Germany .
in Russia during the late 1970s , the group was paid in oil commodities because of an embargo on the ru@@ ble .
on 13 September 1979 , AB@@ BA began at North@@ lands Col@@ is@@ eum in Ed@@ mon@@ ton , Canada , with a full house of 14,000 .
&quot; the voices of the band , Ag@@ ne@@ tha &apos;s high sau@@ c@@ iness combined with round , rich lower tones of Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d , were excellent ... Techn@@ ically perfect , melo@@ dically correct and always in perfect pitch ... The soft lower voice of Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d and the high , ed@@ gy voc@@ als of Ag@@ ne@@ tha were stunning , &quot; ra@@ ved &quot; Ed@@ mon@@ ton Journal &quot; .
during the next four weeks they played a total of 17 sold @-@ out dates , 13 in the United States and four in Canada .
the last scheduled AB@@ BA concert in the United States in Washington , D.C. was cancelled due to F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og &apos;s emotional distress suffered during the flight from New York to Boston , when the group &apos;s private plane was subjected to extreme weather conditions and was unable to land for an extended period .
they appeared at the Boston Music Hall for the performance 90 minutes late .
the tour ended with a show in Toronto , Canada at Ma@@ ple Leaf Gardens before a capacity crowd of 18,000 .
&quot; AB@@ BA plays with surprising power and volume ; but although they are loud , they &apos;re also clear , which does justice to the signature vocal sound ... Anyone who &apos;s been waiting five years to see Ab@@ ba will be well satisfied , &quot; wrote &quot; Record World &quot; .
on 19 October 1979 , the tour resumed in Western Europe where the band played 23 sold @-@ out gig@@ s , including six sold @-@ out nights at London &apos;s W@@ embl@@ ey Ar@@ ena .
</p>
<p>
in March 1980 , AB@@ BA travelled to Japan where upon their arrival at Nar@@ ita International Airport , they were besieged by thousands of fans .
the group played eleven concerts to full houses , including six shows at Tokyo &apos;s Bud@@ ok@@ an .
this tour was the last &quot; on the road &quot; adventure of their career .
in the middle of 1980 , the group released the single &quot; The W@@ inner Takes It All &quot; the group &apos;s eighth UK chart top@@ per .
the song is widely misunderstood as being written about Ul@@ va@@ eus and F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og &apos;s marital trib@@ ulations ;
Ul@@ va@@ eus wrote the lyrics , but has stated they were not about his own divorce ;
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og has repeatedly stated she was not the loser in their divorce .
in the United States , the single peaked at number @-@ eight on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 chart and became AB@@ BA &apos;s second &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Adult Contemporary number @-@ one .
it was also re @-@ recorded by Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus with a slightly different backing track , by French chan@@ te@@ use Mi@@ re@@ ille Mathi@@ eu at the end of 1980 - as &quot; Bravo tu as g@@ agn@@ é , &quot; with French lyrics by Alain Bou@@ bl@@ il .
November the same year saw the release of AB@@ BA &apos;s seventh album &quot; Super Trou@@ per &quot; , which reflected a certain change in AB@@ BA &apos;s style with more prominent use of synthe@@ siz@@ ers and increasingly personal lyrics .
it set a record for the most pre @-@ orders ever received for a UK album after one million copies were ordered before release .
the second single from the album , &quot; Super Trou@@ per , &quot; also hit number @-@ one in the UK , becoming the group &apos;s ninth and final UK chart @-@ top@@ per .
another track from the &quot; Super Trou@@ per &quot; album , &quot; Lay All Your Love on Me , &quot; released in 1981 as a single only in selected territories , managed to top the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart and peaked at number @-@ seven on the UK singles chart becoming , at the time , the highest ever charting release in UK chart history .
also in 1980 , AB@@ BA recorded a compilation of Spanish @-@ language versions of their hits called &quot; Grac@@ ias P@@ or La M@@ ú@@ s@@ ica &quot; .
this was released in Spanish @-@ speaking countries as well as in Japan and Australia .
the album became a major success , and along with the Spanish version of &quot; Chi@@ qu@@ iti@@ ta , &quot; this signalled the group &apos;s breakthrough in Latin America . &quot;
AB@@ BA Oro : Gran@@ des É@@ x@@ itos &quot; , the Spanish equivalent of &quot; AB@@ BA Gold : greatest H@@ its &quot; , was released in 1999 .
</p>
<p>
in January 1981 , Ul@@ va@@ eus married L@@ ena Kä@@ ll@@ ers@@ jö , and manager Sti@@ g Anderson celebrated his 50th birthday with a party .
for this occasion , AB@@ BA recorded the track &quot; H@@ ov@@ as V@@ itt@@ ne &quot; as a tribute to him , and released it only on 200 red vinyl copies , to be distributed to the guests attending the party .
this single has become a sought @-@ after collectible .
in mid @-@ February 1981 , Ander@@ sson and Lyn@@ g@@ stad announced they were filing for divorce .
information surfaced that their marriage had been an uphill struggle for years , and B@@ enny had already met another woman , Mona N@@ ör@@ k@@ lit , whom he married in November 1981 .
Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus had song@@ writing sessions in early 1981 , and recording sessions began in mid @-@ March .
at the end of April , the group recorded a TV special , &quot; Dick Cav@@ ett Meets AB@@ BA &quot; with the US talk show host Dick Cav@@ ett . &quot;
the Visitors &quot; , AB@@ BA &apos;s eighth and final studio album , showed a song@@ writing maturity and depth of feeling distinctly lacking from their earlier recordings but still placing the band squarely in the pop genre , with cat@@ chy tunes and harmon@@ ies .
although not revealed at the time of its release , the album &apos;s title track , according to Ul@@ va@@ eus , refers to the secret meetings held against the approval of totalitarian governments in Soviet @-@ dominated states , while other tracks address topics like failed relationships , the threat of war , ageing , and loss of innocence .
the album &apos;s only major single release , &quot; One of Us , &quot; proved to be the last of AB@@ BA &apos;s nine number @-@ one singles in Germany , this being in December 1981 ; and the sw@@ ans@@ ong of their sixteen Top 5 singles on the South African chart .
&quot; one of Us &quot; was also AB@@ BA &apos;s final Top 3 hit in the UK , reaching No. 1 on some charts .
although it topped the album charts across most of Europe , including Ireland , the UK and Germany , &quot; The Visitors &quot; was not as commercially successful as its predecessors , showing a commercial decline in previously loyal markets such as France , Australia and Japan .
a track from the album , &quot; When All Is Said and D@@ one , &quot; was released as a single in North America , Australia and New Zealand , and fit@@ tingly became AB@@ BA &apos;s final Top 40 hit in the US , while also reaching the US Adult Contemporary Top 10 , and number @-@ four on the R@@ PM Adult Contemporary chart in Canada .
the song &apos;s lyrics , as with &quot; The W@@ inner Takes It All &quot; and &quot; One of Us , &quot; dealt with the painful experience of separating from a long @-@ term partner , though it looked at the trauma more optimis@@ tically .
with the now public@@ ised story of Ander@@ sson and Lyn@@ g@@ stad &apos;s divorce , speculation increased of tension within the band .
also released in the United States was the title track of &quot; The Visitors &quot; , which hit the Top Ten on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart .
</p>
<p>
in the spring of 1982 , song@@ writing sessions had started and the group came together for more recordings .
plans were not completely clear , but a new album was discussed and the prospect of a small tour suggested .
the recording sessions in May and June 1982 were a struggle , and only three songs were eventually recorded :
&quot; you O@@ we Me One , &quot; &quot; I Am the City &quot; and &quot; Just Like That . &quot; Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus were not satisfied with the outcome , so the tapes were shelved and the group took a break for the summer .
back in the studio again in early August , the group had changed plans for the rest of the year : they settled for a Christmas release of a double album compilation of all their past single releases to be named &quot; &quot; .
new song@@ writing and recording sessions took place , and during October and December , they released the singles &quot; The Day Before You C@@ ame &quot; / &quot; Cass@@ andra &quot; and &quot; Under Attack &quot; / &quot; You O@@ we Me One , &quot; the A @-@ sides of which were included on the compilation album .
neither single made the Top 20 in the United Kingdom , though &quot; The Day Before You C@@ ame &quot; became a Top 5 hit in many European countries such as Germany , the Netherlands and Belgium .
the album went to number @-@ one in the UK and Belgium , Top 5 in the Netherlands and Germany and Top 20 in many other countries .
&quot; under Attack , &quot; the group &apos;s final release before disbanding , was a Top 5 hit in the Netherlands and Belgium .
&quot; I Am the City &quot; and &quot; Just Like That &quot; were left un@@ released on &quot; The Sing@@ les : the First Ten Years &quot; for possible inclusion on the next projected studio album , though this never came to fruition .
&quot; I Am the City &quot; was eventually released on the compilation album &quot; &quot; in 1993 , while &quot; Just Like That &quot; has been recycled in new songs with other artists produced by Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus .
a re@@ worked version of the verses ended up in the musical &quot; Ch@@ ess &quot; .
the chorus section of &quot; Just Like That &quot; was eventually released on a retrospective box set in 1994 , as well as in the &quot; AB@@ BA Un@@ deleted &quot; med@@ ley featured on disc 9 of &quot; The Complete Studio Rec@@ ord@@ ings &quot; .
despite a number of requests from fans , Ul@@ va@@ eus and Ander@@ sson are still refusing to release AB@@ BA &apos;s version of &quot; Just Like That &quot; in its entirety , even though the complete version has surfaced on boot@@ legs .
the group travelled to London to promote &quot; The Sing@@ les : the First Ten Years &quot; in the first week of November 1982 , appearing on &quot; Saturday Super@@ store &quot; and &quot; The Late , Late Break@@ fast Show &quot; , and also to West Germany in the second week , to perform on Show Express .
on 19 November 1982 , AB@@ BA appeared for the last time in Sweden on the TV programme N@@ ö@@ j@@ es@@ mas@@ kin@@ en , and on 11 December 1982 , they made their last performance ever , transmitted to the UK on Noel Ed@@ monds &apos; &quot; The Late , Late Break@@ fast Show &quot; , through a live link from a TV studio in Stockholm .
</p>
<p>
Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus began collaborating with Tim Rice in early 1983 on writing songs for the musical project &quot; Ch@@ ess &quot; , while F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and Lyn@@ g@@ stad both concentrated on international solo careers .
while Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus were working on the musical , a further co @-@ operation among the three of them came with the musical &quot; Ab@@ bac@@ ad@@ ab@@ ra &quot; that was produced in France for television .
it was a children &apos;s musical util@@ ising 14 AB@@ BA songs .
Alain and Daniel Bou@@ bl@@ il , who wrote &quot; Les Mis@@ é@@ ra@@ bles &quot; , had been in touch with Sti@@ g Anderson about the project , and the TV musical was aired over Christmas on French TV and later a Dutch version was also broadcast .
Bou@@ bl@@ il previously also wrote the French lyric for Mi@@ re@@ ille Mathi@@ eu &apos;s version of &quot; The W@@ inner Takes It All . &quot; Ann@@ i @-@ Fri@@ d Lyn@@ g@@ stad , who had recently moved to Paris , participated in the French version , and recorded a single , &quot; Bel@@ le , &quot; a du@@ et with French singer Daniel Bal@@ avo@@ ine .
the song was a cover of AB@@ BA &apos;s 1976 instrumental track &quot; Ar@@ rival . &quot; as the single &quot; Bel@@ le &quot; sold well in France , Cameron Mack@@ intosh wanted to stage an English @-@ language version of the show in London , with the French lyrics translated by David Wood and Don Black ;
Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus got involved in the project , and contributed with one new song , &quot; I Am the See@@ ker . &quot; &quot; Ab@@ bac@@ ad@@ ab@@ ra &quot; premi@@ ered on 8 December 1983 at the Ly@@ ric Ham@@ mer@@ smith Theatre in London , to mixed reviews and full houses for eight weeks , closing on 21 January 1984 .
Lyn@@ g@@ stad was also involved in this production , recording &quot; Bel@@ le &quot; in English as &quot; Time , &quot; a du@@ et with actor and singer B. A. Robertson : the single sold well , and was produced and recorded by Mike Bat@@ t .
a year later , Lyn@@ g@@ stad performed &quot; I Have A Dream &quot; with a children &apos;s choir at the United Nations Organisation Gala , in May 1984 at Geneva , Switzerland .
all four members made their public appearance as four friends more than as AB@@ BA in January 1986 , when they recorded a video of themselves performing an acoustic version of &quot; T@@ iv@@ ed@@ sha@@ mb@@ o &quot; , for a Swedish TV show honouring Anderson on his 55th birthday .
the four had not seen each other for more than two years .
that same year they also performed privately at another friend &apos;s 40th birthday : their old tour manager , Cla@@ es af Gei@@ jer@@ st@@ am .
they sang a self @-@ written song titled &quot; Der Kle@@ ine Franz &quot; that was later to re@@ surface in &quot; Ch@@ ess &quot; .
also in 1986 , &quot; AB@@ BA Live &quot; was released , featuring selections of live performances from the group &apos;s 1977 and 1979 tours .
the four members were guests at the 50th birthday of Gö@@ rel Hans@@ er in 1999 .
Hans@@ er was a long @-@ time friend of all four , and also former secretary of Sti@@ g Anderson .
honouring Gö@@ rel , AB@@ BA performed a Swedish birthday song &quot; Med En En@@ kel Tul@@ ip@@ an &quot; a cap@@ p@@ ella .
B@@ enny Ander@@ sson has on several occasions performed old AB@@ BA songs .
in June 1992 , he and Ul@@ va@@ eus appeared with U@@ 2 at a Stockholm concert , singing the chorus of &quot; D@@ ancing Queen , &quot; and a few years later during the final performance of the B &amp; B in Concert in Stockholm , Ander@@ sson joined the cast for an enc@@ ore at the piano .
Ander@@ sson frequently adds an AB@@ BA song to the play@@ list when he performs with his BA@@ O band .
he also played the piano during new recordings of the AB@@ BA songs &quot; Like an Angel P@@ assing Through My Room &quot; with opera singer Anne So@@ fie von Ot@@ ter , and &quot; When All Is Said and D@@ one &quot; with Swe@@ de Vi@@ k@@ tor@@ ia Tolstoy .
in 2002 , Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus both performed an a cap@@ p@@ ella rendition of the first verse of &quot; Fernando &quot; as they accepted their Iv@@ or Nov@@ ello award in London .
Lyn@@ g@@ stad performed and recorded an a cap@@ p@@ ella version of &quot; D@@ ancing Queen &quot; with the Swedish group the Real Group in 1993 , and also re @-@ recorded &quot; I Have a Dream &quot; with Swiss singer Dan Dani@@ ell in 2003 .

<p>
AB@@ BA has never officially announced the end of the group , but it has long been considered dissolved .
their final public performance together as AB@@ BA was on the British TV programme &quot; The Late , Late Break@@ fast Show &quot; on 11 December 1982 .
while reminis@@ cing on &quot; The Day Before You C@@ ame , &quot; Ul@@ va@@ eus said :
&quot; we might have continued for a while longer if that had been a number one . &quot; in January 1983 , F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og started recording sessions for a solo album , as Lyn@@ g@@ stad had successfully released her album &quot; Something &apos;s Going On &quot; some months earlier .
Ul@@ va@@ eus and Ander@@ sson , meanwhile , started song@@ writing sessions for the musical &quot; Ch@@ ess &quot; .
in interviews at the time , B@@ jö@@ r@@ n and B@@ enny denied the split of AB@@ BA , and Lyn@@ g@@ stad and F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og kept claiming in interviews that AB@@ BA would come together for a new album repeatedly during 1983 and 1984 .
internal strife between the group and their manager escalated and the band members sold their shares in Polar Music during 1983 .
except for a TV appearance in 1986 , the four@@ some did not come together publicly again until they were reunited at the Swedish premiere of the &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia ! &quot; movie on 4 July 2008 .
in an interview with the &quot; Sunday Telegraph &quot; , following the premiere , Ul@@ va@@ eus and Ander@@ sson confirmed that there was nothing that could entice them back on stage again .
she admitted that she has not yet brought the idea up to the other three members .
in April 2013 , she reiterated her hopes for reunion during an interview with &quot; Die Ze@@ it &quot; , stating :
&quot; if they ask me , I &apos;ll say yes . &quot; in a May 2013 interview , F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og , aged 63 at the time , confirmed that an AB@@ BA reunion will never occur :
&quot; I think we have to accept that it will not happen , because we are too old and each one of us has their own life . too many years have gone by since we stopped , and there &apos;s really no meaning in putting us together again . &quot; F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og further explained that the band members remained on amicable terms :
&quot; it &apos;s always nice to see each other now and then and to talk a little and to be a little nostalgic . &quot; in an April 2014 interview , F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og , when asked about whether the band might reunite for a new recording said :
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to talk about this because then all the news stories will be : &apos; AB@@ BA is going to record another song ! &apos; but as long as we can sing and play , then why not ? I would love to , but it &apos;s up to B@@ jö@@ r@@ n and B@@ enny . &quot;
</p>
<p>
on 20 January 2016 , all four original members of AB@@ BA made a public appearance at &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia ! the Party &quot; in Stockholm .
on 6 June 2016 , the four members of AB@@ BA appeared together at a private party at Ber@@ ns Sal@@ on@@ ger in Stockholm , which was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus &apos;s first meeting .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and Lyn@@ g@@ stad sang the AB@@ BA song &quot; The Way Old Friends Do &quot; before they were joined on stage by Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus .
British manager Simon Fuller announced in a statement in October 2016 that the group would be re@@ uniting to work on a new &apos; digital entertainment experience &apos; .
the project will feature the members in their &quot; life @-@ like &quot; hologram form based on their late 1970s tour and is set to launch by the spring of 2019 .
on 27 April 2018 , the members announced that they had recorded two new songs , with one titled &quot; I Still Have Faith in You , &quot; to feature in a TV special set to air later in the year .
the other new track is called &quot; Don &apos;t Shu@@ t Me Down . &quot; in September 2018 , B@@ jö@@ r@@ n Ul@@ va@@ eus revealed that the two new songs , &quot; I Still Have Faith in You &quot; and &quot; Don &apos;t Shu@@ t Me Down , &quot; as well as the aforementioned TV special now called , would be released no earlier than March 2019 .

the musical ran for five years in Stockholm , and an English version has been in development for some considerable time .
it has been reported that a Broadway production is in its earliest stages of pre @-@ production .
in the meantime , following some earlier workshops , a full presentation of the English translation of the musical in concert , now with the shortened name of &quot; &quot; Kris@@ tina &quot; &quot; , took place to capacity crowds in September 2009 at New York &apos;s Carnegie Hall , and in April 2010 at London &apos;s Royal Albert Hall , followed by a CD release of the New York recordings .

the same year the members of AB@@ BA went their separate ways , the French production of a &quot; tribute &quot; show spawned new interest in the group &apos;s music .
after receiving little attention during the mid @-@ to @-@ late @-@ 1980s , AB@@ BA &apos;s music experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s due to the UK syn@@ th @-@ pop duo Era@@ sure , who released a cover extended play featuring versions of AB@@ BA songs which topped the charts in 1992 .
as U@@ 2 arrived in Stockholm for a concert in June of that year , the band paid homage to AB@@ BA by inviting B@@ jö@@ r@@ n Ul@@ va@@ eus and B@@ enny Ander@@ sson to join them on stage for a rendition of &quot; D@@ ancing Queen , &quot; playing guitar and keyboards .
September 1992 saw the release of &quot; &quot; , a new compilation album .
the single &quot; D@@ ancing Queen &quot; received radio air@@ play in the UK in the middle of 1992 to promote the album .
the song returned to the Top 20 of the UK singles chart in August that year , this time peaking at number 16 .
the enormous interest in the &quot; AB@@ BA Gold : greatest H@@ its &quot; compilation saw the release of &quot; &quot; in 1993 .
in 1994 , two Australian cult films caught the attention of the world &apos;s media , both focusing on admiration for AB@@ BA :
&quot; the Ad@@ ventures of Pris@@ c@@ illa , Queen of the Desert &quot; and &quot; Mu@@ riel &apos;s Wed@@ ding &quot; .
the same year , &quot; Thank You for the Music &quot; , a four @-@ disc box set comprising all the group &apos;s hits and stand @-@ out album tracks , was released with the involvement of all four members .
&quot; by the end of the twentieth century , &quot; American critic Chuck K@@ lo@@ ster@@ man wrote a decade later , &quot; it was far more contr@@ arian to hate AB@@ BA than to love them . &quot; AB@@ BA were soon recognised and embraced by other acts :
Evan Dan@@ do of the Lem@@ on@@ heads recorded a cover version of &quot; Know@@ ing Me , Know@@ ing You &quot; ;

the group disbanded in 2004 due to a gru@@ elling schedule and intentions to go solo .
in Sweden , the growing recognition of the legacy of Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus resulted in the 1998 &quot; B &amp; B Concer@@ ts &quot; , a tribute concert showcasing not only their AB@@ BA years , but hits both before and after AB@@ BA .

during the appearance , they re @-@ emphasised that they intended never to officially reunite , citing the opinion of Robert Plant that the re @-@ formed L@@ ed Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ in was more like a cover band of itself than the original band .
Ul@@ va@@ eus stated that he wanted the band to be remembered as they were during the peak years of their success .

the book reveals that part of the reason for the band &apos;s outrageous costumes was that Swedish tax laws at the time allowed the cost of outfits that were not suitable for daily wear to be tax deductible .
a sequel to the 2008 movie &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia ! &quot; , titled &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia ! here We Go Again &quot; , was announced on 20 May 2017 and then the film was released on 20 July 2018 .

<p>
AB@@ BA were perfec@@ tionists in the studio , working on tracks until they got them right rather than leaving them to come back to later on .
the band created a basic rhythm track with a drummer , guit@@ arist and bass player , and over@@ laid other arrangements and instruments .
voc@@ als were then added , and orchestra over@@ du@@ bs were usually left until last .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and Lyn@@ g@@ stad contributed ideas at the studio stage .
Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus played them the backing tracks and they made comments and suggestions .
according to F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og , she and Lyn@@ g@@ stad had the final say in how the lyrics were shaped .
when we gather around the piano to get our voices tuned up , we often come up with things we can use in the backing voc@@ als .
after voc@@ als and over@@ du@@ bs were done , the band took up to five days to mix a song .
</p>
<p>
AB@@ BA was widely noted for the colourful and trend @-@ setting costumes its members wore .
the reason for the wild costumes was Swedish tax law .
the cost of the clothes was deductible only if they could not be worn other than for performances .
choreography by Graham T@@ ain@@ ton also contributed to their performance style .
the videos that accompanied some of the band &apos;s biggest hits are often cited as being among the earliest examples of the genre .
most of AB@@ BA &apos;s videos were directed by L@@ asse Hall@@ ström , who would later direct the films &quot; My Life as a Dog &quot; , &quot; The Ci@@ der House Rules &quot; and &quot; Choc@@ ol@@ at &quot; .
AB@@ BA made videos because their songs were hits in many different countries and personal appearances were not always possible .
this was also done in an effort to minimise travelling , particularly to countries that would have required extremely long flights .
F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og and Ul@@ va@@ eus had two young children and F@@ ä@@ l@@ t@@ sk@@ og , who was also afraid of flying , was very reluctant to leave her children for such a long time .
AB@@ BA &apos;s manager , Sti@@ g Anderson , realised the potential of showing a simple video clip on television to public@@ ise a single or album , thereby allowing easier and quicker exposure than a concert tour .
some of these videos have become classics because of the 1970s @-@ era costumes and early video effects , such as the grouping of the band members in different combinations of pairs , overlapping one singer &apos;s profile with the other &apos;s full face , and the contrasting of one member against another .
in 1976 , AB@@ BA participated in an advertising campaign to promote the Matsu@@ sh@@ ita Electric Industrial Co . &apos; S brand , National , in Australia .
the campaign was also broadcast in Japan .
five commercial spots , each of approximately one minute , were produced , each presenting the &quot; National Song &quot; performed by AB@@ BA using the melody and instrumental arrangements of &quot; Fernando &quot; and revised lyrics .
</p>
<p>
in September 2010 , band members Ander@@ sson and Ul@@ va@@ eus criticised the right @-@ wing Danish People &apos;s Party for using the AB@@ BA song &quot; Mam@@ ma Mia &quot; at rallies .
the band threatened to file a lawsuit against the DF , saying they never allowed their music to be used politically and that they had absolutely no interest in supporting the party .
their record label Universal Music later said that no legal action would be taken because an agreement had been reached .
</p>
<p>
during their active career , from 1972 to 1982 , AB@@ BA placed twenty singles on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 , fourteen of which made the top 40 and ten of which made the Top 20 on both charts .
a total of four of those singles reached the Top 10 , including &quot; D@@ ancing Queen &quot; which reached number @-@ one in April 1977 .
while &quot; Fernando &quot; and &quot; SOS &quot; did not break the Top 10 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 chart , reaching number 13 and 15 respectively , they did reach the Top 10 on C@@ ash@@ box and Record World charts .
both &quot; D@@ ancing Queen &quot; and &quot; Take A Chance On Me &quot; were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies each .
the group also had 12 Top 20 singles on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Adult Contemporary chart with two of them , &quot; Fernando &quot; and &quot; The W@@ inner Takes It All , &quot; reaching number @-@ one .
&quot; lay All Your Love on Me &quot; was AB@@ BA &apos;s fourth number @-@ one single on a &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; chart , topping the Hot Dance Club Play chart .
nine AB@@ BA albums made their way into the top half of the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; 200 album chart , with seven of them reaching the Top 50 and four reaching the Top 20 . &quot;

it topped the Bill@@ board Top Pop Cat@@ alog Alb@@ ums chart in August 2008 , being the group &apos;s first number one album ever on any of the Bill@@ board album charts .
it sold 6@@ x Pl@@ atinum .
on 15 March 2010 , AB@@ BA were induc@@ ted into the Rock and Roll Hall of F@@ ame by B@@ ee Ge@@ es members Barry Gib@@ b and Robin Gib@@ b .

Alfred El@@ ton van V@@ og@@ t was a Canadian @-@ born science fiction author .
his narrative style was compelling and stimulating , and in this way , influenced later science fiction writers , notably Philip K. Dick .
he is regarded as one of the most popular , influential and complex practitioners of the mid @-@ twentieth century , the genre &apos;s so @-@ called Golden Age .
</p>
<p>
Alfred V@@ og@@ t was born on April 26 , 1912 on his grandparents &apos; farm in E@@ denburg , Manitoba , a tiny Russian M@@ enn@@ onite community east of Gret@@ na , Manitoba , Canada in the M@@ enn@@ onite West Reserve .
he was the third of six children born to Hein@@ rich &quot; Henry &quot; V@@ og@@ t and A@@ gan@@ eth@@ a &quot; Agnes &quot; V@@ og@@ t , both of whom were themselves born in Manitoba , but who grew up in heavily immigrant communities .
until age four , van V@@ og@@ t and his family spoke only a dialect of Low German at home .
for the first dozen or so years of his life , van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s father , Henry V@@ og@@ t , a lawyer , moved his family several times within western Canada , ali@@ gh@@ ting successively in Neville , Saskatchewan ; M@@ ord@@ en , Manitoba ; and finally Winni@@ peg , Manitoba .
Alfred V@@ og@@ t found these moves difficult , later re@@ marking : childhood was a terrible period for me .
I was like a ship without anchor being swept along through darkness in a storm .
again and again I sought shelter , only to be forced out of it by something new .
by the 1920s , living in Winni@@ peg , father Henry worked as an agent for a steam@@ ship company , but the stock market crash of 1929 proved financially disastrous , as the family was unable to afford to send Alfred to college .
during his teen years , Alfred worked as a farm@@ hand and a truck driver , and by the age of 19 , he was working in Ottawa for the Canadian census bureau .
he began his writing career with stories in the true confession style of pulp magazines such as &quot; True Story &quot; .
most of these stories were published anonymously , with the first @-@ person narratives allegedly being written by people in extraordinary , emotional , and life @-@ changing circumstances .
after a year in Ottawa , he moved back to Winni@@ peg , where he sold newspaper advertising space and continued to write .
while continuing to pen melo@@ dramatic &quot; true confessions &quot; stories through 1937 , he also began writing short radio dramas for local radio station CK@@ Y , as well as conducting interviews published in trade magazines .
he added the middle name &quot; El@@ ton &quot; at some point in the mid @-@ 1930s , and at least one confessional story was sold to the &quot; Toronto Star &quot; , who mis@@ spelled his name &quot; Alfred Al@@ ton Bog@@ t &quot; in the by@@ line .
shortly thereafter , he added the &quot; van &quot; to his surname , and from that point forward he used the name &quot; A.@@ E. van V@@ og@@ t &quot; both personally and professionally .
</p>
<p>
by 1938 , van V@@ og@@ t decided to switch to writing science fiction , a genre he enjoyed reading .
he was inspired by the August 1938 issue of &quot; A@@ st@@ ounding Science Fic@@ tion , &quot; which he picked up at a news@@ stand .
John W. Campbell &apos;s novel@@ ette &quot; Who Go@@ es There ? &quot; inspired van V@@ og@@ t to write &quot; Va@@ ult of the Be@@ ast , &quot; which he submitted to that same magazine .
Campbell , who edited &quot; A@@ st@@ ounding &quot; , sent van V@@ og@@ t a rejection letter , but one which encouraged van V@@ og@@ t to try again .
Van V@@ og@@ t sent another story , entitled &quot; Black D@@ estro@@ yer , &quot; which was accepted .
a revised version of &quot; Va@@ ult of the Be@@ ast &quot; would be published in 1940 .
Van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s first SF publication was inspired by &quot; The Voy@@ age of the Be@@ ag@@ le &quot; by Charles Darwin .
&quot; the Black D@@ estro@@ yer &quot; was published in July 1939 by John W. Campbell in &quot; A@@ st@@ ounding Science Fic@@ tion &quot; , the centennial year of Darwin &apos;s journal .
it featured a fierce , carniv@@ orous alien , the co@@ e@@ ur@@ l , stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship , and served as the inspiration for multiple science fiction movies , including &quot; Alien &quot; .
also in 1939 , still living in Winni@@ peg , van V@@ og@@ t married Ed@@ na May@@ ne H@@ ull , a fellow Manit@@ ob@@ an .
H@@ ull , who had previously worked as a private secretary , would act as van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s typist , and be credited with writing several SF stories of her own throughout the early 1940s .
the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 caused a change in van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s circumstances .
ineligible for military service due to his poor eyesight , van V@@ og@@ t accepted a cler@@ king job with the Canadian Department of National Defence .
this necessitated a move back to Ottawa , where he and his wife would stay for the next year @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half .
meanwhile , his writing career continued .
&quot; discord in Scar@@ let &quot; was van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s second story to be published , also appearing as the cover story .
it was accompanied by interior illustrations created by Frank Kra@@ mer and Paul Or@@ ban .
Van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s first completed novel , and one of his most famous , is &quot; S@@ lan &quot; , which Campbell seri@@ alized in &quot; A@@ st@@ ounding &quot; September to December 1940 .
using what became one of van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s recurring themes , it told the story of a nine @-@ year @-@ old super@@ man living in a world in which his kind are slain by &quot; Hom@@ o sap@@ i@@ ens &quot; .
others saw van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s talent and star@@ dom from his first story , and in May 1941 , van V@@ og@@ t decided to become a full @-@ time writer , quitting his job at the Canadian Department of National Defence .
freed from the necessity of living in Ottawa , he and his wife lived for a time in the G@@ ati@@ ne@@ au region of Quebec before moving to Toronto in the fall of 1941 .
prolific throughout this period , van V@@ og@@ t wrote many of his more famous short stories and novels in the years from 1941 through 1944 .
the novels &quot; The Book of P@@ ta@@ th &quot; and &quot; The Weapon M@@ akers &quot; both appeared in magazines in serial form during this era ; they were later published in book form after World War II .
as well , several of the stories that were compiled to make up the novels &quot; The Weapon Sh@@ ops of Ish@@ er &quot; , &quot; The Mixed Men &quot; and &quot; The War Against the R@@ ull &quot; were also published during this time .
</p>
<p>
in November 1944 , van V@@ og@@ t and H@@ ull moved to Hollywood ; van V@@ og@@ t would spend the rest of his life in California .
he had been using the name &quot; A.@@ E. van V@@ og@@ t &quot; in his public life for several years , and as part of the process of obtaining American citizenship in 1945 he finally and formally changed his legal name from Alfred V@@ og@@ t to Alfred El@@ ton van V@@ og@@ t .
to his friends in the California science fiction community , he was known as &quot; Van . &quot; Van V@@ og@@ t systematized his writing method , using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved .
several of his stories hinge on temporal conun@@ dra , a favorite theme .
he stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from three books :
&quot; narrative Technique &quot; by Thomas U@@ zz@@ ell , &quot; The Only Two Ways to Write a Story &quot; by John Gall@@ is@@ ha@@ w , and &quot; Twenty Problems of the Fic@@ tion Writer &quot; by Gall@@ is@@ ha@@ w .
he also claimed many of his ideas came from dreams ; throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90 minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams .
Van V@@ og@@ t was also always interested in the idea of all @-@ encompassing systems of knowledge - the characters in his very first story used a system called &quot; N@@ exi@@ alism &quot; to analyze the alien &apos;s behavior .
around this time , he became particularly interested in the general semantics of Alfred Kor@@ zy@@ b@@ ski .
he subsequently wrote a novel merging these overarching themes , &quot; The World of Ā &quot; , originally seri@@ alized in A@@ st@@ ounding in 1945 .
ā , or non @-@ Aristot@@ el@@ ian logic , refers to the capacity for , and practice of , using intuitive , inductive reasoning , rather than reflexi@@ ve , or conditioned , deduc@@ tive reasoning .
the novel re@@ counts the adventures of an individual living in an apparent Utopia , where those with superior brain@@ power make up the ruling class ... though all is not as it seems .
a sequel , &quot; The P@@ layers of Ā &quot; was seri@@ alized in 1948 / 49 .
at the same time , in his fiction , van V@@ og@@ t was consistently sympathetic to absolute monarchy as a form of government .
this was the case , for instance , in the &quot; Weapon Shop &quot; series , the &quot; Mixed Men &quot; series , and in single stories such as &quot; He@@ ir Ap@@ parent &quot; , whose protagonist was described as a &quot; benevolent dictator . &quot; these sympathies were the subject of much critical discussion during van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s career , and afterwards .
Van V@@ og@@ t published &quot; En@@ chan@@ ted Village &quot; in the July 1950 issue of &quot; Other Wor@@ l@@ ds Science Stories &quot; .
it was reprinted in over 20 collections or anth@@ ologies , and appeared many times in translation .
</p>
<p>
in 1950 , van V@@ og@@ t was briefly appointed as head of L. Ron Hub@@ bard &apos;s Di@@ ane@@ tics operation in California .
Van V@@ og@@ t had first met Hub@@ bard in 1945 , and became interested in his Di@@ ane@@ tics theories , which were published shortly thereafter .
Di@@ ane@@ tics was the secular precursor to Hub@@ bard &apos;s Church of Scient@@ ology ; van V@@ og@@ t would have no association with Scient@@ ology , as he did not approve of its mys@@ ticism .
the California Di@@ ane@@ tics operation went broke nine months later , but never went bankrupt , due to van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s arrangements with creditors .
very shortly after that , van V@@ og@@ t and his wife opened their own Di@@ ane@@ tics center , partly financed by his writings , until he &quot; signed off &quot; around 1961 .
in practical terms , what this meant was that from 1951 through 1961 , van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s focus was on Di@@ ane@@ tics , and no new story ideas flowed from his typewriter .
however , during the 1950s , van V@@ og@@ t retrospectively patched together many of his previously published stories into novels , sometimes creating new intersti@@ tial material to help bridge gaps in the narrative .
Van V@@ og@@ t referred to the resulting books as &quot; fix @-@ ups , &quot; a term that entered the vocabulary of science @-@ fiction criticism .
when the original stories were closely related this was often successful - although some van V@@ og@@ t fix @-@ ups featured disparate stories thrown together that bore little relation to each other , generally making for a less coherent plot .
one of his most well @-@ known novels , &quot; The Voy@@ age of the Space Be@@ ag@@ le &quot; was a fix @-@ up of four short stories including &quot; Dis@@ cord in Scar@@ let &quot; ; it was published in at least five European languages by 1955 .
still , although Van V@@ og@@ t averaged a new book title every ten months from 1951 to 1961 , none of them were new stories .
all of van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s books from 1951 to 1961 were fix @-@ ups , or collections of previously published stories , or expansions of previously published short stories to novel length , or re@@ publications of his books under new titles .
all were based on story material written and originally published between 1939 and 1950 .
as well , one non @-@ fiction work , &quot; The H@@ yp@@ noti@@ sm Handbook &quot; , appeared in 1956 , though it had apparently been written much earlier .
some of van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s more well @-@ known work was still produced using the fix @-@ up method .
in 1951 , he published the fix @-@ up &quot; The Weapon Sh@@ ops of Ish@@ er . &quot; in the same decade , van V@@ og@@ t also produced collections and fix@@ ups such as &quot; The Mixed Men &quot; , &quot; The War Against the R@@ ull &quot; , and the two &quot; C@@ lane &quot; novels , &quot; Empire of the At@@ om &quot; and &quot; The Wizard of Lin@@ n &quot; , which were inspired by Roman imperial history , specifically the reign of Clau@@ dius .
after more than a decade of running their Di@@ ane@@ tics center , H@@ ull and van V@@ og@@ t closed it in 1961 .
nevertheless , van V@@ og@@ t maintained his association with the overall organization and was still president of the Californian Association of Di@@ ane@@ tic Auditors into the 1980s .
</p>
<p>
though the constant re @-@ packaging of his older work meant that he had never really been away from the book publishing world , van V@@ og@@ t had not published any wholly new fiction for almost 12 years when he decided to return to writing in 1962 .
he did not return immediately to science fiction , however , but instead wrote the only mainstream , non @-@ s@@ f novel of his career .
Van V@@ og@@ t was profoundly affected by revelations of totalitarian police states that emerged after World War II .
accordingly , he wrote a mainstream novel that he set in Communist China , &quot; The Violent Man &quot; ; he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about China .
into this book he incorporated his view of &quot; the violent male type , &quot; which he described as a &quot; man who had to be right , &quot; a man who &quot; instantly attracts women &quot; and who he said were the men who &quot; run the world . &quot; contemporary reviews were lukewarm at best , and van V@@ og@@ t thereafter returned to science fiction .
from 1963 through the mid @-@ 1980s , van V@@ og@@ t once again published new material on a regular basis , though fix @-@ ups and re@@ worked material also appeared relatively often .
his later novels included fix@@ ups such as &quot; The Be@@ ast &quot; , &quot; Ro@@ gue Ship &quot; , &quot; Quest for the Future &quot; and &quot; Super@@ mind &quot; .
he also wrote novels by expanding previously published short stories ; works of this type include &quot; The Dar@@ kness on Diam@@ on@@ dia &quot; and &quot; Future G@@ litter &quot; .
novels that were written simply as novels , and not seri@@ alized magazine pieces or fix @-@ ups , were very rare in van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s oeuv@@ re , but began to appear regularly beginning in the 1970s .
Van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s original novels included &quot; Children of Tomorrow &quot; , &quot; The Battle of Forever &quot; and &quot; The An@@ arch@@ istic Col@@ os@@ sus &quot; .
over the years , many sequ@@ els to his classic works were promised , but only one appeared : &quot; null @-@ A Three &quot; .
several later books were originally published in Europe , and at least one novel only ever appeared in foreign language editions and was never published in its original English .
Van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s first wife , Ed@@ na May@@ ne H@@ ull , died in 1975 .
Van V@@ og@@ t would marry Lydia Ber@@ eg@@ in@@ sky in 1979 ; they remained together until his death .
</p>
<p>
when the 1979 film &quot; Alien &quot; appeared , it was noted that the plot closely matched the plot of van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s &quot; Voy@@ age of the Space Be@@ ag@@ le &quot; .
Van V@@ og@@ t sued the production company for plagiarism , and eventually collected an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement of $ 50,000 from 20th Century Fox .
in increasingly frail health , van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s final short story appeared in 1986 .
the Science Fic@@ tion Writers of America named him its 14th Grand Master in 1995 .
also in 1996 , van V@@ og@@ t received a Special Award from the World Science Fic@@ tion Convention &quot; for six decades of golden age science fiction . &quot; that same year , he was induc@@ ted as an inaugural member of the Science Fic@@ tion and F@@ ant@@ asy Hall of F@@ ame .
on January 26 , 2000 , A. E. van V@@ og@@ t died in Los Angeles from Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
he was survived by his second wife , the former Lydia Ber@@ eg@@ in@@ sky .

<p>
critical opinion about the quality of van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s work is sharply divided .
an early and articulate critic was Dam@@ on Knight .
in a 1945 chapter @-@ long essay reprinted in &quot; In Search of Won@@ der , &quot; entitled &quot; Co@@ sm@@ ic J@@ err@@ y@@ builder : A. E. van V@@ og@@ t , &quot; Knight described van V@@ og@@ t as &quot; no giant ; he is a pyg@@ my who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter . &quot; Knight described &quot; The World of N@@ ull @-@ A &quot; as &quot; one of the worst allegedly adult science fiction stories ever published . &quot; concerning van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s writing , Knight said :
in general van V@@ og@@ t seems to me to fail consistently as a writer in these elementary ways : 1 .
his plots do not bear examination .
his choice of words and his sentence @-@ structure are fum@@ bling and insensitive .
he is unable either to visualize a scene or to make a character seem real .
about &quot; Empire of the At@@ om &quot; Knight wrote :
if you can only throw your reasoning powers out of gear - something many van V@@ og@@ t fans find easy to do - you &apos;ll enjoy this one .
Knight also expressed misgivings about van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s politics .
he noted that van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s stories almost invariably present absolute monarchy in a favorable light .
in 1974 , Knight retracted some of his criticism after finding out about V@@ og@@ t &apos;s working methods about writing down his dreams :
this explains a good deal about the stories , and suggests that it is really useless to attack them by conventional standards .
if the stories have a dream consistency which affects readers powerfully , it is probably irrelevant that they lack ordinary consistency .
Knight &apos;s criticism greatly damaged van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s reputation .
on the other hand , when science fiction author Philip K. Dick was asked &quot; Ver@@ tex Inter@@ views Philip K. Dick &quot; . &quot;
vertex &quot; , Vol .
6 , February 197@@ 4. which science fiction writers had influenced his work the most , he replied :
I started reading s@@ f when I was about twelve and I read all I could , so any author who was writing about that time , I read .
but there &apos;s no doubt who got me off originally and that was A.@@ E. van V@@ og@@ t .
there was in van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s writing a mysterious quality , and this was especially true in &quot; The World of N@@ ull A &quot; .
all the parts of that book did not add up ; all the ingredients did not make a coher@@ ency .
now some people are put off by that .
they think that &apos;s sloppy and wrong , but the thing that fascinated me so much was that this resembled reality more than anybody else &apos;s writing inside or outside science fiction .
Dick also defended van V@@ og@@ t against Dam@@ on Knight &apos;s criticisms :
Dam@@ on feels that it &apos;s bad arti@@ stry when you build those fun@@ ky uni@@ verses where people fall through the floor .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s viewing a story the way a building inspector would when he &apos;s building your house .
but reality really is a mess , and yet it &apos;s exciting .
the basic thing is , how frightened are you of chaos ?
and how happy are you with order ?
Van V@@ og@@ t influenced me so much because he made me appreciate a mysterious chaotic quality in the universe which is not to be feared .
in a review of &quot; Trans@@ finite : the Essential A. E. van V@@ og@@ t &quot; , science fiction writer Paul Di Fil@@ ipp@@ o said :
Van V@@ og@@ t knew precisely what he was doing in all areas of his fiction writing .
there &apos;s hardly a wasted word in his stories . ...
his plots are marv@@ els of interlocking pieces , often ending in real surprises and shocks , genuine paradigm shifts , which are among the hardest conceptions to depict .
and the intellectual material of his fic@@ tions , the conce@@ its and tossed @-@ off observations on culture and human and alien behavior , reflect a probing mind . ...
each tale contains a new angle , a unique slant , that makes it stand out .
in &quot; The John W. Campbell Letters &quot; , Campbell says , &quot; The son @-@ of @-@ a @-@ gun gets hold of you in the first paragraph , ties a knot around you , and keeps it tied in every paragraph thereafter - including the ultimate last one . &quot; Har@@ lan Ell@@ ison wrote , &quot; Van was the first writer to shine light on the restricted ways in which I had been taught to view the universe and the human condition . &quot; writing in 1984 , David Hart@@ well said :
no one has taken van V@@ og@@ t seriously as a writer for a long time .
yet he has been read and &quot; still &quot; is .
what no one seems to have noticed is that van V@@ og@@ t , more than any other single SF writer , is the conduit through which the energy of Ger@@ ns@@ back@@ ian , primitive wonder stories have been transmitted through the Camp@@ belli@@ an age , when earlier styles of SF were otherwise rejected , and on into SF of the present .
the literary critic Leslie A. Fi@@ ed@@ ler said something similar :
Van V@@ og@@ t is a test case ... since an apology for or analysis of science fiction which fails to come to terms with his appeal and major importance , defends or defines the genre by falsi@@ fying it .
American literary critic Fre@@ dr@@ ic Jam@@ eson says of van V@@ og@@ t : that van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s work clearly prepares the way for that of the greatest of all Science Fic@@ tion writers , Philip K. Dick , whose extraordinary novels and stories are inconceivable without the opening onto that play of unconscious materials and fantasy dynamics released by van V@@ og@@ t , and very different from the more hard @-@ science aesthetic ideologies of his contemporaries .
Van V@@ og@@ t still has his critics .
for example , Dar@@ rell Schwe@@ itzer writing to &quot; The New York Review of Science Fic@@ tion &quot; in 1999 quoted a passage from the original van V@@ og@@ t novel@@ ette &quot; The Mixed Men , &quot; which he was then reading , and remarked :
this is the realism , and logic , of a small boy playing with toy soldiers in a sand@@ box .
I &apos;m tougher than you .
I &apos;ve got a &quot; billion &quot; spac@@ eships !
they only took 800 years to develop .
and this is a story in which most of the cast either have two brains or are really robots ... and even the emotions of the human characters are programmed or de@@ programmed as part of plots within counter plots .
next to this , Doc Smith was an icy realist .
there is &quot; no &quot; intersection with adult reality at any point , for all van V@@ og@@ t was able to write was that small boy &apos;s sand@@ box game with an adult level of intensity .
this is , I think , the secret of van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s bizarre fascination , as awful as his actual writing might be , and why he appealed so strongly to Philip K. Dick , who managed to put more adult characters and emotions into equally crazy situations .
it &apos;s ultimately very strange to find this sort of writing so prominently sponsored by supposedly rational and scientifically minded John W. Campbell , when it seems to contravene everything the Golden Age stood for .
</p>
<p>
in 1946 , van V@@ og@@ t and his first wife , Ed@@ na May@@ ne H@@ ull , were Gu@@ ests of Honor at the fourth World Science Fic@@ tion Convention .
in 1980 , van V@@ og@@ t received a &quot; Cas@@ per Award &quot; for Life@@ time Achievement .
the Science Fic@@ tion Writers of America named him its 14th Grand Master in 1995 .
great controversy within SF@@ WA accompanied its long wait in best@@ owing its highest honor .
writing an ob@@ itu@@ ary of van V@@ og@@ t , Robert J. Sawyer , a fellow Canadian writer of science fiction , remarked :
there was no doubt that van V@@ og@@ t should have received this honor much earlier - the injustice of him being overlooked , at least in part because of dam@@ nable SF@@ WA politics , had so incen@@ sed Har@@ lan Ell@@ ison , a man with an impeccable moral compass , that he &apos;d lobbied hard on the Sci @-@ Fi Channel and elsewhere on van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s behalf .
it is generally held that the &quot; dam@@ nable SF@@ WA politics &quot; concerns Dam@@ on Knight , the founder of the SF@@ WA , who abhor@@ red van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s style and politics and thoroughly demolished his literary reputation in the 1950s .
Har@@ lan Ell@@ ison was more explicit in 1999 introduction to &quot; Futures Past : the Best Short Fic@@ tion of A. E. van V@@ og@@ t &quot; :
well , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s true or not , though it was common coin in the field for years ; but Dam@@ on got the Grand Master award in 1994 .
and Van got it in 1995 .
as they say during sweeps week on television : coincidence or conspiracy ?
in 1996 , van V@@ og@@ t received a Special Award from the World Science Fic@@ tion Convention &quot; for six decades of golden age science fiction . &quot; that same year , the Science Fic@@ tion and F@@ ant@@ asy Hall of F@@ ame induc@@ ted him in its inaugural class of two deceased and two living persons , along with writer Jack William@@ son and editors Hugo Ger@@ ns@@ back and John W. Campbell .
the works of van V@@ og@@ t were translated into French by the sur@@ realist Boris V@@ ian , and van V@@ og@@ t &apos;s works were &quot; viewed as great literature of the sur@@ realist school . &quot; in addition , &quot; S@@ lan &quot; was published in French , translated by Jean Rosenthal , under the title &quot; À la p@@ our@@ suite des Sl@@ ans &quot; , as part of the paperback series &apos; E@@ ditions J &apos;@@ ai Lu :
Romans @-@ Tex@@ te Integral &apos; in 1973 , this edition also listing the following works by van V@@ og@@ t as having been published in French as part of this series :

Alan Alexander Mil@@ ne was a British author , best known for his books about the teddy bear Win@@ nie @-@ the @-@ P@@ ooh and for various poems .
Mil@@ ne was a noted writer , primarily as a play@@ wright , before the huge success of P@@ ooh overshadowed all his previous work .
Mil@@ ne served in both World Wars , joining the British Army in World War I , and was a captain of the British Home Guard in World War II .
</p>
<p>
Alan Alexander Mil@@ ne was born in Kil@@ burn , London to parents John V@@ ine Mil@@ ne , who was born in Jamaica , and Sarah Marie Mil@@ ne and grew up at Hen@@ ley House School , 6 / 7 Mor@@ timer Road , Kil@@ burn , a small public school run by his father .
one of his teachers was H. G. Wells , who taught there in 1889 @-@ 90 .
Mil@@ ne attended Westminster School and Trinity College , Cambridge where he studied on a mathematics scholarship , graduating with a B.A. in Mathematics in 1903 .
he edited and wrote for &quot; Gran@@ ta &quot; , a student magazine .
he collaborated with his brother Kenneth and their articles appeared over the initi@@ als A@@ KM .
Mil@@ ne &apos;s work came to the attention of the leading British humour magazine &quot; Pun@@ ch &quot; , where Mil@@ ne was to become a contributor and later an assistant editor .
Mil@@ ne played for the amateur English cricket team the Alla@@ hak@@ barri@@ es alongside authors J. M. Barri@@ e and Arthur Con@@ an Doyle .
Mil@@ ne joined the British Army in World War I and served as an officer in the Royal War@@ w@@ ick@@ shire Regiment and later , after a debilitating illness , the Royal Corps of Sign@@ als .
he was commissioned into the 4th Battalion , Royal War@@ w@@ ick@@ shire Regiment on 1 February 1915 as a second lieutenant .
his commission was confirmed on 20 December 1915 .
on 7 July 1916 , he was injured while serving in the Battle of the Som@@ me and invali@@ ded back to England .
having recuper@@ ated , he was recruited into Military Intelligence to write propaganda articles for MI@@ 7 between 1916 and 1918 .
he was discharged on 14 February 1919 , and settled in Mall@@ ord Street , Chelsea .
he relinquished his commission on 19 February 1920 , retaining the rank of lieutenant .
after the war , he wrote a denunciation of war titled &quot; Peace with Honour &quot; , which he retracted somewhat with 1940 &apos;s &quot; War with Honour &quot; .
during World War II , Mil@@ ne was one of the most prominent critics of fellow English writer P. G. Wo@@ de@@ house , who was captured at his country home in France by the Nazis and imprisoned for a year .
Wo@@ de@@ house made radio broadcasts about his internment , which were broadcast from Berlin .
although the light @-@ hearted broadcasts made fun of the Germans , Mil@@ ne accused Wo@@ de@@ house of committing an act of near treason by cooperating with his country &apos;s enemy .
Wo@@ de@@ house got some revenge on his former friend by creating fat@@ uous paro@@ dies of the Christopher Robin poems in some of his later stories , and claiming that Mil@@ ne &quot; was probably jealous of all other writers .... But I loved his stuff . &quot; Mil@@ ne married Dorothy &quot; Daphn@@ e &quot; de Sé@@ lin@@ court in 19@@ 13 and their son Christopher Robin Mil@@ ne was born in 1920 .
in 1925 , Mil@@ ne bought a country home , Cot@@ ch@@ ford Farm , in Hart@@ field , East Sus@@ sex .
during World War II , Mil@@ ne was Captain of the British Home Guard in Hart@@ field &amp; Forest R@@ ow , insisting on being plain &quot; Mr. Mil@@ ne &quot; to the members of his platoon .
he retired to the farm after a stroke and brain surgery in 1952 left him an invalid , and by August 1953 &quot; he seemed very old and dis@@ enchanted . &quot; Mil@@ ne died in January 1956 , aged 74 .
</p>
<p>
after graduating from Cambridge in 1903 , A. A. Mil@@ ne contributed humorous verse and whim@@ s@@ ical essays to &quot; Pun@@ ch &quot; , joining the staff in 1906 and becoming an assistant editor .
during this period he published 18 plays and three novels , including the murder mystery &quot; The Red House My@@ stery &quot; .
his son was born in August 1920 and in 1924 Mil@@ ne produced a collection of children &apos;s poems , &quot; When We Were Very Young &quot; , which were illustrated by &quot; Pun@@ ch &quot; staff carto@@ onist E. H. She@@ pard .
a collection of short stories for children &quot; A Gallery of Children &quot; , and other stories that became part of the Win@@ nie @-@ the @-@ P@@ ooh books , were first published in 1925 .
Mil@@ ne was an early screen@@ writer for the nascent British film industry , writing four stories filmed in 1920 for the company Min@@ er@@ va Films .
these were &quot; The B@@ ump &quot; , starring Au@@ bre@@ y Smith ; &quot; Tw@@ ice Two &quot; ; &quot; Five P@@ ound R@@ eward &quot; ; and &quot; Book@@ worms &quot; .
some of these films survive in the archives of the British Film Institute .
Mil@@ ne had met Howard when the actor star@@ red in Mil@@ ne &apos;s play &quot; Mr P@@ im P@@ asses By &quot; in London .
looking back on this period , Mil@@ ne observed that when he told his agent that he was going to write a detective story , he was told that what the country wanted from a &quot; &quot; Pun@@ ch &quot; hum@@ or@@ ist &quot; was a humorous story ; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhy@@ mes , his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story ; and after another two years , he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children &apos;s books .
he concluded that &quot; the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it ; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory &quot; con am@@ ore &quot; as I should be ashamed to create a Blan@@ k Ver@@ se Tra@@ ge@@ dy at the bidding of others . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Mil@@ ne is most famous for his two &quot; P@@ ooh &quot; books about a boy named Christopher Robin after his son , Christopher Robin Mil@@ ne , and various characters inspired by his son &apos;s stuffed animals , most notably the bear named Win@@ nie @-@ the @-@ P@@ ooh .
Christopher Robin Mil@@ ne &apos;s stuffed bear , originally named &quot; Edward , &quot; was renamed &quot; Win@@ nie &quot; after a Canadian black bear named Win@@ nie , which was used as a military mascot in World War I , and left to London Zoo during the war .
&quot; the po@@ oh &quot; comes from a swan the young Mil@@ ne named &quot; P@@ ooh . &quot; E. H. She@@ pard illustrated the original P@@ ooh books , using his own son &apos;s teddy , Grow@@ ler , as the model .
the rest of Christopher Robin Mil@@ ne &apos;s toys , Pig@@ let , E@@ ey@@ ore , K@@ anga , Ro@@ o and Tig@@ ger , were incorporated into A. A. Mil@@ ne &apos;s stories , and two more characters - Rabbit and Ow@@ l - were created by Mil@@ ne &apos;s imagination .
Christopher Robin Mil@@ ne &apos;s own toys are now on display in New York where 750,000 people visit them every year .
the fictional Hundred Ac@@ re Wood of the P@@ ooh stories derives from Five Hundred Ac@@ re Wood in Ash@@ down Forest in East Sus@@ sex , South East England , where the P@@ ooh stories were set .
Mil@@ ne lived on the northern edge of the forest at Cot@@ ch@@ ford Farm , , and took his son walking there .
E. H. She@@ pard drew on the landscapes of Ash@@ down Forest as inspiration for many of the illustrations he provided for the P@@ ooh books .
the adult Christopher Robin commented : &quot; P@@ ooh &apos;s Forest and Ash@@ down Forest are identical . &quot; popular tourist locations at Ash@@ down Forest include :
&quot; gal@@ le@@ on &apos;s L@@ ap &quot; , &quot; The En@@ chan@@ ted Place &quot; , the &quot; He@@ ff@@ al@@ ump Tra@@ p &quot; and &quot; L@@ one P@@ ine &quot; , &quot; E@@ ey@@ ore &apos;s S@@ ad and G@@ lo@@ omy Place &quot; , and the wooden &quot; P@@ ooh Bridge &quot; where P@@ ooh and Pig@@ let invented P@@ oo@@ h@@ sticks .
not yet known as P@@ ooh , he made his first appearance in a poem , &quot; Teddy Bear , &quot; published in &quot; Pun@@ ch &quot; magazine in February 1924 and re@@ published in &quot; When We Were Very Young &quot; .
P@@ ooh first appeared in the &quot; London Evening News &quot; on Christmas Eve , 1925 , in a story called &quot; The W@@ rong Sor@@ t Of B@@ ees . &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie @-@ the @-@ P@@ ooh &quot; was published in 1926 , followed by &quot; The House at P@@ ooh Corner &quot; in 1928 .
a second collection of nursery rhy@@ mes , &quot; Now We Are Six &quot; , was published in 1927 .
all four books were illustrated by E. H. She@@ pard .
Mil@@ ne also published four plays in this period .
he also &quot; gall@@ antly stepped forward &quot; to contribute a quarter of the costs of dram@@ ati@@ sing P. G. Wo@@ de@@ house &apos;s &quot; A Dam@@ sel in Di@@ stress &quot; . &quot;
the World of P@@ ooh &quot; won the Lewis Car@@ roll Shelf Award in 1958 .
</p>
<p>
the success of his children &apos;s books was to become a source of considerable annoyance to Mil@@ ne , whose self @-@ avowed aim was to write whatever he pleased and who had , until then , found a ready audience for each change of direction : he had freed pre @-@ war &quot; Pun@@ ch &quot; from its ponder@@ ous fac@@ eti@@ ousness ; he had made a considerable reputation as a play@@ wright on both sides of the Atlantic ; he had produced a witty piece of detective writing in &quot; The Red House My@@ stery &quot; .
but once Mil@@ ne had , in his own words , &quot; said goodbye to all that in 70,000 words &quot; , he had no intention of producing any re@@ workings lacking in originality , given that one of the sources of inspiration , his son , was growing older .
in 1930 , Mil@@ ne adapted Kenneth Gra@@ ha@@ me &apos;s novel &quot; The Wind in the Wil@@ lows &quot; for the stage as &quot; Toad of Toad Hall &quot; .
the title was an implicit admission that such chapters as Chapter 7 , &quot; The Pi@@ per at the Gates of Dawn , &quot; could not survive translation to the theatre .
a special introduction written by Mil@@ ne is included in some editions of Gra@@ ha@@ me &apos;s novel .
Mil@@ ne and his wife became estranged from their son , who came to resent what he saw as his father &apos;s exploitation of his childhood and came to hate the books that had thrust him into the public eye .
marrying his first cousin , Les@@ ley de Sé@@ lin@@ court , distan@@ ced Christopher still further from his parents - Les@@ ley &apos;s father and Christopher &apos;s mother hadn &apos;t spoken to each other for 30 years .

<p>
&quot; I suppose that every one of us hopes secretly for immortality ; to leave , I mean , a name behind him which will live forever in this world , whatever he may be doing , himself , in the next . &quot; the rights to A. A. Mil@@ ne &apos;s P@@ ooh books were left to four beneficiaries : his family , the Royal Literary Fund , Westminster School and the Gar@@ rick Club .
after Mil@@ ne &apos;s death in 1956 , one week and six days after his 74th birthday , his widow sold her rights to the P@@ ooh characters to Stephen S@@ les@@ inger , whose widow sold the rights after S@@ les@@ inger &apos;s death to the Walt Disney Company , which has made many P@@ ooh cartoon movies , a Disney Channel television show , as well as P@@ ooh @-@ related merchandise .
in 2001 , the other beneficiaries sold their interest in the estate to the Disney Corporation for $ 3@@ 50m .

Mil@@ ne did not speak out much on the subject of religion , although he used religious terms to explain his decision , while remaining a pacif@@ ist , to join the British Home Guard :
&quot; in fighting Hitler , &quot; he wrote , &quot; we are truly fighting the Devil , the Anti @-@ Christ ... Hitler was a crus@@ ader against God . &quot; his best known comment on the subject was recalled on his death :
the Old Testament is responsible for more athe@@ ism , ag@@ no@@ stic@@ ism , disbelief - call it what you will - than any book ever written ; it has emptied more churches than all the counter @-@ attractions of cinema , motor bicycle and golf course .
he wrote in the poem &quot; Ex@@ plain@@ ed &quot; : Elizabeth Ann Said to her Nan :
&quot; please will you tell me how God began ? &quot; somebody &quot; must have made Him . so Who could it be , &apos; cos I want to know ? &quot; he also wrote in the poem &quot; Ves@@ pers &quot; :
&quot; Oh ! thank you , God , for a lovely day . and what was the other I had to say ? I said &quot; B@@ less Daddy , &quot; so what can it be ? Oh ! now I remember it . God bless Me . &quot;

Al@@ vin T@@ off@@ ler was an American writer , futur@@ ist , and businessman known for his works discussing modern technologies , including the digital revolution and the communication revolution , with emphasis on their effects on cultures worldwide .
T@@ off@@ ler was an associate editor of &quot; Fortune &quot; magazine .
in his early works he focused on technology and its impact , which he termed &quot; information overload . &quot; in 1970 his first major book about the future , &quot; Future Sh@@ ock &quot; , became a worldwide best @-@ seller and has sold over 6 million copies .
he and his wife Hei@@ di T@@ off@@ ler , who collaborated with him for most of his writings , moved on to examining the reaction to changes in society with another best @-@ selling book , &quot; The Third Wave &quot; in 1980 .
in it , he foresaw such technological advances as cloning , personal computers , the Internet , cable television and mobile communication .
his later focus , via their other best @-@ seller , &quot; Power@@ shift &quot; , , was on the increasing power of 21st @-@ century military hardware and the proliferation of new technologies . &quot;
&quot; he founded T@@ off@@ ler Associates , a management consulting company , and was a visiting scholar at the Russell S@@ age Foundation , visiting professor at Cornell University , faculty member of the New School for Social Research , a White House correspondent , and a business consultant .
T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s ideas and writings were a significant influence on the thinking of business and government leaders worldwide , including China &apos;s Zhao Zi@@ yang , and AOL founder Steve Case .
</p>
<p>
Al@@ vin T@@ off@@ ler was born on October 4 , 1928 , in New York City , and raised in Brooklyn .
he was the son of Rose and Sam T@@ off@@ ler , a fur@@ rier , both Jewish immigrants from Poland .
he had one younger sister .
he was inspired to become a writer at the age of 7 by his aunt and uncle , who lived with the T@@ off@@ lers .
&quot; they were Depression @-@ era literary intellectuals , &quot; T@@ off@@ ler said , &quot; and they always talked about exciting ideas . &quot; T@@ off@@ ler graduated from New York University in 1950 as an English major , though by his own account he was more focused on political activism than grades .
he met his future wife , Adel@@ aide Elizabeth Far@@ rell , when she was starting a graduate course in linguistics .
being radical students , they decided against further graduate work and moved to the Midwest , where they married on April 29 , 1950 .
</p>
<p>
seeking experiences to write about , Al@@ vin and Hei@@ di T@@ off@@ ler spent the next five years as blue collar workers on assembly lines while studying industrial mass production in their daily work .
he compared his own desire for experience to other writers , such as Jack London , who in his quest for subjects to write about sailed the seas , and John Stein@@ beck , who went to pick grapes with migrant workers .
in their first factory jobs , Hei@@ di became a union shop steward in the aluminum foundry where she worked .
Al@@ vin became a mill@@ wright and wel@@ der .
in the evenings Al@@ vin would write poetry and fiction , but discovered he was proficient at neither .
his hands @-@ on practical labor experience helped Al@@ vin T@@ off@@ ler land a position at a union @-@ backed newspaper , a transfer to its Washington bureau in 1957 , then three years as a White House correspondent , covering Congress and the White House for a Pennsylvania daily newspaper .
they returned to New York City in 1959 when &quot; Fortune &quot; magazine invited Al@@ vin to become its labor columnist , later having him write about business and management .
after leaving &quot; Fortune &quot; magazine in 1962 , T@@ off@@ ler began a freelance career , writing long form articles for scholarly journals and magazines .
his 1964 &quot; Playboy interviews &quot; with Russian novelist Vladimir Nab@@ ok@@ ov and Ayn Rand were considered among the magazine &apos;s best .
his interview with Rand was the first time the magazine had given such a platform to a female intellectual , which as one commentator said , &quot; the real bird of paradise T@@ off@@ ler captured for Playboy in 1964 was Ayn Rand . &quot; T@@ off@@ ler was hired by IBM to conduct research and write a paper on the social and organizational impact of computers , leading to his contact with the earliest computer &quot; g@@ urus &quot; and artificial intelligence researchers and proponents .
Xerox invited him to write about its research laboratory and AT &amp; T consulted him for strategic advice .
this AT &amp; T work led to a study of telecommunications , which advised the company &apos;s top management to break up the company more than a decade before the government forced AT &amp; T to break up .
in the mid @-@ 1960s , the T@@ off@@ lers began five years of research on what would become &quot; Future Sh@@ ock &quot; , published in 1970 .
it has sold over 6 million copies worldwide , according to the &quot; New York Times , &quot; or over 15 million copies according to the T@@ off@@ lers &apos; Web site .
T@@ off@@ ler coined the term &quot; future shock &quot; to refer to what happens to a society when change happens too fast , which results in social confusion and normal decision @-@ making processes breaking down .
the book has never been out of print and has been translated into dozens of languages .
he continued the theme in &quot; The Third Wave &quot; in 1980 .
while he describes the first and second waves as the agricultural and industrial revolutions , the &quot; third wave , &quot; a phrase he coined , represents the current information , computer @-@ based revolution .
he forecast the spread of the Internet and email , interactive media , cable television , cloning , and other digital advancements .
he claimed that one of the side effects of the digital age has been &quot; information overload , &quot; another term he coined .
in 1990 he wrote &quot; Power@@ shift &quot; , also with the help of his wife , Hei@@ di .
in 1996 , with American business consultant Tom Johnson , they co @-@ founded T@@ off@@ ler Associates , an advisory firm designed to implement many of the ideas the T@@ off@@ lers had written on .
the firm worked with businesses , NGOs , and governments in the United States , South Korea , Mexico , Brazil , Singapore , Australia , and other countries .
during this period in his career , T@@ off@@ ler lectured worldwide , taught at several schools and met world leaders , such as Mikhail Gorbachev , along with key executives and military officials .

&quot; a new civilization is emerging in our lives , and blind men everywhere are trying to suppress it . this new civilization brings with it new family styles ; changed ways of working , loving , and living ; a new economy ; new political conflicts ; and beyond all this an altered consciousness as well ... The dawn of this new civilization is the single most explosive fact of our lifetimes . &quot; T@@ off@@ ler stated many of his ideas during an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1998 .
among a few of his opinions , he said that &quot; Society needs people who take care of the elderly and who know how to be compassionate and honest . society needs people who work in hospitals . society needs all kinds of skills that are not just cognitive ; they &apos;re emotional , they &apos;re affec@@ tional . you can &apos;t run the society on data and computers alone . &quot; his opinions about the future of education , many of which were in &quot; Future Sh@@ ock &quot; , have often been quoted .
an often mis@@ attributed quote , however , is that of psychologist Herbert Ger@@ ju@@ oy :
&quot; tomorrow &apos;s illiterate will not be the man who can &apos;t read ; he will be the man who has not learned how to learn . &quot; early in his career , after traveling to other countries , he became aware of the new and myriad inputs that visitors received from these other cultures .
he explained during an interview that some visitors would become &quot; truly dis@@ oriented and upset &quot; by the strange environment , which he described as a reaction to culture shock .
from that issue , he foresaw another problem for the future , when a culturally &quot; new environment comes to you ... and comes to you rapidly . &quot; that kind of sudden cultural change within one &apos;s own country , which he felt many would not understand , would lead to a similar reaction , one of &quot; future shock , &quot; which he wrote about in his book by that title .
T@@ off@@ ler writes : we must search out totally new ways to anchor ourselves , for all the old roots - religion , nation , community , family , or profession - are now shaking under the hurricane impact of the acceler@@ ative thrust .
in his book &quot; The Third Wave &quot; , T@@ off@@ ler describes three types of societies , based on the concept of &quot; waves &quot; - each wave pushes the older societies and cultures aside .
he describes the &quot; First Wave &quot; as the society after agrarian revolution and replaced the first hunter @-@ gather@@ er cultures .
the &quot; Second Wave , &quot; he labels society during the Industrial Revolution .
that period saw the increase of urban industrial populations which had undermined the traditional nuclear family , and initiated a factory @-@ like education system , and the growth of the corporation .
T@@ off@@ ler said : the Second Wave Society is industrial and based on mass production , mass distribution , mass consumption , mass education , mass media , mass recreation , mass entertainment , and weapons of mass destruction .
you combine those things with standardization , centralization , concentration , and synchronization , and you wind up with a style of organization we call bureaucracy .
the &quot; Third Wave &quot; was a term he coined to describe the post @-@ industrial society , which began in the late 1950s .
his description of this period dove@@ tails with other futur@@ ist writers , who also wrote about the Information Age , Space Age , Electronic Era , Global Village , terms which highlighted a scientific @-@ technological revolution .
the T@@ off@@ lers claimed to have predicted a number of geopolitical events , such as the collapse of the Soviet Union , the fall of the Berlin Wall and the future economic growth in the Asia @-@ Pacific region .
</p>
<p>
T@@ off@@ ler often visited with dignitaries in Asia , including China &apos;s Zhao Zi@@ yang , Singapore &apos;s Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and South Korea &apos;s Kim D@@ ae Jung , all of whom were influenced by his views as Asia &apos;s emerging markets increased in global significance during the 1980s and 1990s .
although they had originally censored some of his books and ideas , China &apos;s government cited him along with Franklin Roosevelt and Bill Gates as being among the Westerners who had most influenced their country . &quot;
the Third Wave &quot; along with a video documentary based on it became best @-@ sellers in China and were widely distributed to schools .
T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s influence on Asian thinkers was summed up in an article in &quot; Da@@ edul@@ us &quot; , published by the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences :
where an earlier generation of Chinese , Korean , and Vietnamese revolutionaries wanted to re @-@ enact the Paris Commune as imagined by Karl Marx , their post @-@ revolutionary successors now want to re @-@ enact Silicon Valley as imagined by Al@@ vin T@@ off@@ ler .
U.S. House Speaker New@@ t G@@ ing@@ rich publicly lauded his ideas about the future , and urged members of Congress to read T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s book , &quot; Creating a New Civilization &quot; .
others , such as AOL founder Steve Case , cited T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s &quot; The Third Wave &quot; as a formative influence on his thinking , which inspired him to write &quot; The Third Wave : an Entreprene@@ ur &apos;s Vision of the Future &quot; in 2016 .
case said that T@@ off@@ ler was a &quot; real pioneer in helping people , companies and even countries lean into the future . &quot; in 1980 Ted Turner founded CNN , which he said was inspired by T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s forecasting the end of the dominance of the three main television networks .
Turner &apos;s company , Turner Broadcasting , published T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s &quot; Creating a New Civilization &quot; in 1995 .
shortly after the book was released , Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev hosted the Global Governance Conference in San Francisco with the theme , &quot; Tow@@ ard a New Civilization &quot; , which was attended by dozens of world figures , including the T@@ off@@ lers , George H. W. Bush , Margaret Thatcher , Carl S@@ agan , Ab@@ ba E@@ ban and Turner with his then @-@ wife , actress Jane Fon@@ da .
Mexican billionaire Carlos S@@ lim was influenced by his works , and became a friend of the writer .
and global marke@@ ter J.@@ D. Power also said he was inspired by T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s works .
since the 1960s , people had tried to make sense out of the effect of new technologies and social change , a problem which made T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s writings widely influential beyond the confines of scientific , economic , and public policy .
his works and ideas have been subject to various criticisms , usually with the same argumentation used against fu@@ tu@@ ro@@ logy : that foresee@@ ing the future is nigh impossible .
techn@@ o music pioneer Juan Atkins cites T@@ off@@ ler &apos;s phrase &quot; techn@@ o rebels &quot; in &quot; The Third Wave &quot; as inspiring him to use the word &quot; techn@@ o &quot; to describe the musical style he helped to create Mus@@ icians Curtis May@@ field and Her@@ bie Han@@ cock both wrote songs called &quot; Future Sh@@ ock . &quot; science fiction author John Brun@@ ner wrote &quot; The Sh@@ ock@@ wave Ri@@ der , &quot; from the concept of &quot; future shock . &quot; the nightclub T@@ off@@ ler , in Rotterdam , is named after him .
</p>
<p>
Ac@@ cen@@ ture , the management consultancy firm , identified T@@ off@@ ler in 2002 as being among the most influential voices in business leaders , along with Bill Gates and Peter Dru@@ cker .
T@@ off@@ ler has also been described in a &quot; Financial Times &quot; interview as the &quot; world &apos;s most famous fu@@ tu@@ ro@@ logist . &quot; in 2006 the &quot; People &apos;s Daily &quot; classed him among the 50 foreigners who shaped modern China , which one U.S. newspaper notes made him a &quot; guru of sorts to world statesmen . &quot; Prime Minister Zhao Zi@@ yang of China convened conferences to discuss &quot; The Third Wave &quot; in the early 1980s , and in 1985 the book was the No. 2 best seller in China .

Ber@@ th@@ old Kon@@ rad Her@@ mann Albert S@@ peer was a German architect who was , for most of World War II , Reich Minister of Arma@@ ments and War Production for Nazi Germany .
S@@ peer was Ad@@ olf Hitler &apos;s chief architect before assuming ministerial office .
as &quot; the Nazi who said sorry , &quot; he accepted moral responsibility at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs for complicity in crimes of the Nazi regime , while insisting he had been ignorant of the Holocaust .
S@@ peer joined the Nazi Party in 1931 , launching himself on a political and governmental career which lasted fourteen years .
his architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party and he became a member of Hitler &apos;s inner circle .
Hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including the Reich Chancell@@ ery and the &quot; Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ inf@@ eld &quot; stadium in Nuremberg where Party rallies were held .
S@@ peer also made plans to reconstruct Berlin on a grand scale , with huge buildings , wide boulev@@ ards , and a reorganized transportation system .
in February 1942 , Hitler appointed him as Reich Minister of Arma@@ ments and War Production .
after the war , he was tried at Nuremberg and sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the Nazi regime , principally for the use of forced labor .
despite repeated attempts to gain early release , he served his full sentence , most of it at Sp@@ and@@ au Prison in West Berlin .
following his release in 1966 , S@@ peer published two best@@ selling autobi@@ ographical works , &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; and &quot; &quot; , detailing his close personal relationship with Hitler , and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective on the workings of the Nazi regime .
he wrote a third book , &quot; In@@ filtration &quot; , about the SS .
S@@ peer died of a stroke in 1981 while visiting London .
S@@ peer &apos;s legacy is mixed .
his architectural designs have been praised along with his work as a planner and organizer , but his early post @-@ war reputation as remaining aloof from Nazi war crimes has been challenged by scholars who show that he very likely knew about the Holocaust from the beginning .
</p>
<p>
S@@ peer was born in Mann@@ heim , into an upper @-@ middle @-@ class family .
he was the second of three sons of Lu@@ ise M@@ á@@ th@@ il@@ de Wil@@ hel@@ mine and Albert Friedrich S@@ peer .
in 1918 , the family moved permanently to their summer home Villa S@@ peer on Sch@@ loss @-@ Wolf@@ s@@ brun@@ n@@ en@@ we@@ g , Heid@@ elberg .
according to Henry T. King , deputy prosecutor at Nuremberg who later wrote a book about S@@ peer , &quot; Love and warmth were lacking in the household of S@@ peer &apos;s youth . &quot; S@@ peer was active in sports , taking up skiing and mountain@@ eering .
S@@ peer &apos;s Heid@@ elberg school offered rugby football , unusual for Germany , and S@@ peer was a participant .
he wanted to become a mathematician , but his father said if S@@ peer chose this occupation he would &quot; lead a life without money , without a position and without a future . &quot; instead , S@@ peer followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture .
S@@ peer began his architectural studies at the University of Kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the hyper@@ inflation crisis of 1923 limited his parents &apos; income .
in 1924 when the crisis had abated , he transferred to the &quot; much more reputable &quot; Technical University of Munich .
in 1925 he transferred again , this time to the Technical University of Berlin where he studied under Hein@@ rich Tess@@ en@@ ow , whom S@@ peer greatly admired .
after passing his exams in 1927 , S@@ peer became Tess@@ en@@ ow &apos;s assistant , a high honor for a man of 22 .
as such , S@@ peer taught some of Tess@@ en@@ ow &apos;s classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies .
in Munich , and continuing in Berlin , S@@ peer began a close friendship , ultimately spanning over 50 years , with Rud@@ olf Wol@@ ters , who also studied under Tess@@ en@@ ow .
in mid @-@ 1922 , S@@ peer began cour@@ ting Mar@@ garet@@ e Weber , the daughter of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers .
the relationship was frowned upon by S@@ peer &apos;s class @-@ conscious mother , who felt that the We@@ bers were socially inferior .
despite this opposition , the two married in Berlin on August 28 , 1928 ; seven years elapsed before Mar@@ garet@@ e S@@ peer was invited to stay at her in @-@ laws &apos; home .
</p>
<p>
S@@ peer stated he was a@@ political when he was a young man , and he attended a Berlin Nazi rally in December 1930 only at the urging of some of his students .
on March 1 , 1931 , he applied to join the Nazi Party and became member number 47@@ 4,@@ 481 .
in 1931 , S@@ peer surrendered his position as Tess@@ en@@ ow &apos;s assistant and moved to Mann@@ heim .
his father gave him a job as manager of the elder S@@ peer &apos;s properties .
in July 1932 , the Spe@@ ers visited Berlin to help out the Party prior to the &quot; Re@@ ich@@ stag &quot; elections .
while they were there , his friend , Nazi Party official Karl Han@@ ke , recommended the young architect to Joseph Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s to help renovate the Party &apos;s Berlin headquarters .
S@@ peer agreed to do the work .
when the commission was completed , S@@ peer returned to Mann@@ heim and remained there as Hitler took office in January 1933 .
the organizers of the 1933 Nuremberg Rally asked S@@ peer to submit designs for the rally , bringing him into contact with Hitler for the first time .
neither the organizers nor Rud@@ olf H@@ ess were willing to decide whether to approve the plans , and H@@ ess sent S@@ peer to Hitler &apos;s Munich apartment to seek his approval .
this work won S@@ peer his first national post , as Nazi Party &quot; Commissioner for the Artistic and Technical Presentation of Party R@@ allies and Demon@@ str@@ ations . &quot; shortly after Hitler had come into power , he had started to make plans to rebuild the chancell@@ ery .
at the end of 1933 he contracted Paul Tro@@ o@@ st to renovate the entire building .
Hitler appointed S@@ peer , whose work for Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s had impressed him , to manage the building site for Tro@@ o@@ st .
as Chancellor , Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by S@@ peer and the building supervisor on the progress of the renovations .
after one of these briefings , Hitler invited S@@ peer to lunch , to the architect &apos;s great excitement .
Hitler evin@@ ced considerable interest in S@@ peer during the luncheon , and later told S@@ peer that he had been looking for a young architect capable of carrying out his architectural dreams for the new Germany .
S@@ peer quickly became part of Hitler &apos;s inner circle ; he was expected to call on Hitler in the morning for a walk or chat , to provide consultation on architectural matters , and to discuss Hitler &apos;s ideas .
most days he was invited to dinner .
the two men found much in common : Hitler spoke of S@@ peer as a &quot; kindred spirit &quot; for whom he had always maintained &quot; the warmest human feelings . &quot; the young , ambitious architect was dazzled by his rapid rise and close proximity to Hitler , which guaranteed him a flood of commissions from the government and from the highest ranks of the Party .
S@@ peer testified at Nuremberg , &quot; I belonged to a circle which consisted of other artists and his personal staff . if Hitler had had any friends at all , I certainly would have been one of his close friends . &quot;
</p>
<p>
when Tro@@ o@@ st died on January 21 , 1934 , S@@ peer effectively replaced him as the Party &apos;s chief architect .
Hitler appointed S@@ peer as head of the Chief Office for Construction , which placed him nominally on H@@ ess &apos;s staff .
one of S@@ peer &apos;s first commissions after Tro@@ o@@ st &apos;s death was the &quot; Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ inf@@ eld &quot; stadium - the N@@ ür@@ nberg parade grounds seen in Len@@ i Ri@@ ef@@ en@@ sta@@ hl &apos;s propaganda masterpiece &quot; Tri@@ um@@ ph of the Will &quot; .
this huge work was able to hold 34@@ 0,000 people .
S@@ peer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night , both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the individual Nazis , many of whom were overweight .
S@@ peer surrounded the site with 130 anti @-@ aircraft search@@ lights .
S@@ peer described this as his most beautiful work , and as the only one that stood the test of time .
N@@ ür@@ nberg was to be the site of many more official Nazi buildings , most of which were never built ; for example , the German Stadium would have accommodated 400,000 spectators , while an even larger rally ground would have held half a million people .
while planning these structures , S@@ peer conceived the concept of &quot; ruin value &quot; : that major buildings should be constructed in such a way they would leave aesthe@@ tically pleasing ruins for thousands of years into the future .
such ruins would be a testament to the greatness of Nazi Germany , just as ancient Greek or Roman ruins were symbols of the greatness of those civilizations .
when Hitler de@@ prec@@ ated Werner March &apos;s design for the for the 1936 Summer Olympics as too modern , S@@ peer modified the plans by adding a stone exterior .
S@@ peer designed the German Pavilion for the 1937 international exposition in Paris .
the German and Soviet pavilion sites were opposite each other .
on learning that the Soviet design included two colossal figures seemingly about to overrun the German site , S@@ peer modified his design to include a cubic mass which would check their advance , with a huge eagle on top looking down on the Soviet figures .
S@@ peer received , from Hitler Youth leader and later fellow Sp@@ and@@ au prisoner Bal@@ dur von Sch@@ ir@@ ach , the Golden Hitler Youth Honor Bad@@ ge with oak leaves .
in 1937 , Hitler appointed S@@ peer as with the rank of under@@ secretary of state in the Reich government .
the position carried with it extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government and made S@@ peer answerable to Hitler alone .
it also made S@@ peer a member of the &quot; Re@@ ich@@ stag &quot; , though the body by then had little effective power .
Hitler ordered S@@ peer to develop plans to rebuild Berlin .
the plans centered on a three @-@ mile long grand boulev@@ ard running from north to south , which S@@ peer called the &quot; Pr@@ ach@@ t@@ stra@@ sse &quot; , or Street of Magn@@ ific@@ ence ; he also referred to it as the &quot; North @-@ South A@@ xis . &quot; at the northern end of the boulev@@ ard , S@@ peer planned to build the &quot; Volk@@ sh@@ alle &quot; , a huge assembly hall with a dome which would have been over high , with floor space for 180,000 people .
at the southern end of the avenue a great triumph@@ al arch would rise ; it would be almost high , and able to fit the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe inside its opening .
the outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to the postponement , and later the abandonment , of these plans .
part of the land for the boulev@@ ard was to be obtained by consolidating Berlin &apos;s railway system .
S@@ peer hired Wol@@ ters as part of his design team , with special responsibility for the &quot; Pr@@ ach@@ t@@ stra@@ sse &quot; .
when S@@ peer &apos;s father saw the model for the new Berlin , he said to his son , &quot; You &apos;ve all gone completely insane . &quot; all the while plans to build a new Reich chancell@@ ery had been underway since 1934 .
land had been purchased by the end of 1934 and starting in March 1936 the first buildings were demolished to create space at Vo@@ ß@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
S@@ peer was involved virtually from the beginning .
he had been commissioned to renovate the Bor@@ si@@ g Palace on the corner of Vo@@ ß@@ stra@@ ß@@ e and Wil@@ hel@@ m@@ stra@@ ß@@ e as a headquarter for the SA , who were about to be relocated from Munich to Berlin in the aftermath of the R@@ ö@@ hm pur@@ ge@@ . and completed the preliminary work for the new chancell@@ ery by May 1936 .
in June 1936 he charged a personal honor@@ arium of 30,000 Re@@ ich@@ s@@ mark and estimated that the chancell@@ ery would be completed within three to four years .
detailed plans were completed in July 1937 and the first shell of the new chancell@@ ery was complete on 1 January 1938 .
on 27 January 1938 S@@ peer received pleni@@ potentiary powers from Hitler to finish the new chancell@@ ery by 1 January 1939 .
yet for propag@@ an@@ dis@@ tic reasons , to prove the vigor and organizational skills of National Soci@@ alism , Hitler claimed during the topping @-@ out ceremony on 2 August 1938 that he had ordered S@@ peer to build the new chancell@@ ery just that year .
S@@ peer reiterated this claim in his memoirs to show that he had been up to that supposed challenge , and some of his bi@@ ographers , most notably Joachim F@@ est , have followed that account .
the building itself , hailed by Hitler as the &quot; crow@@ ning glory of the greater German political empire , &quot; was designed as a theatrical set for representation , &quot; to intimidate and humiliate , &quot; as historian Martin Kitchen puts it .
because of shortages of labor , the construction workers had to work in two ten@@ - to twelve @-@ hour shifts to have the chancell@@ ery completed by early January 1939 .
during the war the chancell@@ ery was destroyed , except for the exterior walls , by air raids and in the Battle of Berlin in 1945 .
it was eventually dismantled by the Soviets .
rumor has it that the remains have been used for other building projects like the Hum@@ bold@@ t University , Moh@@ ren@@ stra@@ ß@@ e metro station or Soviet war memorials in Berlin , but none of these are true .
during the Chancell@@ ery project , the po@@ g@@ rom of K@@ rist@@ all@@ n@@ acht took place .
S@@ peer made no mention of it in the first draft of &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; , and it was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Syn@@ ago@@ gue in Berlin from his car .
S@@ peer was under significant psychological pressure during this period of his life .
he later remembered : soon after Hitler had given me the first large architectural commissions , I began to suffer from anxiety in long tunnels , in airplanes , or in small rooms .
my heart would begin to race , I would become breathless , the diaphragm would seem to grow heavy , and I would get the impression that my blood pressure was rising tremendously ...
anxiety amidst all my freedom and power !
</p>
<p>
S@@ peer supported the German invasion of Poland and subsequent war , though he recognized that it would lead to the postponement , at the least , of his architectural dreams .
in his later years , S@@ peer , talking with his bi@@ ographer @-@ to @-@ be Git@@ ta Ser@@ en@@ y , explained how he felt in 1939 :
&quot; of course I was perfectly aware that &#91; Hitler &#93; sought world domination ... &#91; A &#93; t that time I asked for nothing better . that was the whole point of my buildings . they would have looked grotesque if Hitler had sat still in Germany . all I &quot; wanted &quot; was for this great man to dominate the globe . &quot; S@@ peer placed his department at the disposal of the &quot; We@@ hr@@ mach@@ t &quot; .
when Hitler re@@ mon@@ strated , and said it was not for S@@ peer to decide how his workers should be used , S@@ peer simply ignored him .
among S@@ peer &apos;s innovations were quick @-@ reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris ; before long , these units would be used to clear bomb sites .
as the war progressed , initially to great German success , S@@ peer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and N@@ ür@@ nberg plans .
S@@ peer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the &quot; We@@ hr@@ mach@@ t &quot; and &quot; Lu@@ f@@ tw@@ aff@@ e &quot; .
in 1940 , Joseph Stalin proposed that S@@ peer pay a visit to Moscow .
Stalin had been particularly impressed by S@@ peer &apos;s work in Paris , and wished to meet the &quot; Architec@@ t of the Reich . &quot; Hitler , alternating between amusement and anger , did not allow S@@ peer to go , fearing that Stalin would put S@@ peer in a &quot; rat hole &quot; until a new Moscow arose .
when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 , S@@ peer came to doubt , despite Hitler &apos;s reas@@ surances , that his projects for Berlin would ever be completed .
</p>
<p>
on February 8 , 1942 , Minister of Arma@@ ments F@@ ritz T@@ od@@ t died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitler &apos;s eastern headquarters at Rast@@ enburg .
S@@ peer , who had arrived in Rast@@ enburg the previous evening , had accepted T@@ od@@ t &apos;s offer to fly with him to Berlin , but had cancelled some hours before takeoff .
later that day , Hitler appointed S@@ peer as T@@ od@@ t &apos;s successor to all of his posts .
in &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; , S@@ peer re@@ counts his meeting with Hitler and his reluctance to take ministerial office , saying that he only did so because Hitler commanded it .
S@@ peer also states that Her@@ mann Gö@@ ring raced to Hitler &apos;s headquarters on hearing of T@@ od@@ t &apos;s death , hoping to claim T@@ od@@ t &apos;s powers .
Hitler instead presented Gö@@ ring with the &quot; fait accompli &quot; of S@@ peer &apos;s appointment .
at the time of S@@ peer &apos;s accession to the office , the German economy , unlike the British one , was not fully geared for war production .
consumer goods were still being produced at nearly as high a level as during peacetime .
no fewer than five &quot; Supreme Authorities &quot; had jurisdiction over armament production - one of which , the Ministry of Economic Affairs , had declared in November 1941 that conditions did not permit an increase in armament production .
few women were employed in the factories , which were running only one shift .
one evening soon after his appointment , S@@ peer went to visit a Berlin armament factory ; he found no one on the premises .
S@@ peer overcame these difficulties by centralizing power over the war economy in himself .
factories were given autonomy , or as S@@ peer put it , &quot; self @-@ responsibility , &quot; and each factory concentrated on a single product .
backed by Hitler &apos;s strong support , he divided the armament field according to weapon system , with experts rather than civil servants overseeing each department .
no department head could be older than 55 - anyone older being susceptible to &quot; routine and arrogance &quot; - and no deputy older than 40 .
over these departments was a central planning committee headed by S@@ peer , which took increasing responsibility for war production , and as time went by , for the German economy itself .
according to the minutes of a conference at &quot; We@@ hr@@ mach@@ t &quot; High Command in March 1942 , &quot; It is only S@@ peer &apos;s word that counts nowadays . he can interfere in all departments . already he over@@ rides all departments ... On the whole , S@@ peer &apos;s attitude is to the point . &quot; Go@@ eb@@ bel@@ s would note in his diary in June 1943 , &quot; S@@ peer is still tops with the &quot; F@@ ü@@ hr@@ er &quot; . he is truly a genius with organization . &quot; S@@ peer was so successful in his position that by late 1943 , he was widely regarded among the Nazi elite as a possible successor to Hitler .
while S@@ peer had tremendous power , he was of course subordinate to Hitler .
Nazi officials sometimes went around S@@ peer by seeking direct orders from the dictator .
when S@@ peer ordered peacetime building work suspended , the &quot; Gaul@@ e@@ iters &quot; obtained an exemption for their pet projects .
when S@@ peer sought the appointment of Han@@ ke as a labor cz@@ ar to optimize the use of German and slave labor , Hitler , under the influence of Martin Bor@@ mann , instead appointed F@@ ritz Sau@@ ck@@ el .
rather than increasing female labor and taking other steps to better organize German labor , as S@@ peer favored , Sau@@ ck@@ el advocated importing more slave labour from the occupied nations - and did so , obtaining workers for S@@ peer &apos;s armament factories , often using the most brutal methods .
on December 10 , 1943 , S@@ peer visited the underground Mit@@ tel@@ wer@@ k V @-@ 2 rocket factory that used concentration camp labor .
S@@ peer claimed after the war that he had been shocked by the conditions there .
by 1943 , the Allies had gained air superiority over Germany , and bombings of German cities and industry had become commonplace .
however , the Allies in their strategic bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry , and S@@ peer was able to overcome bombing losses .
in spite of these losses , German production of tanks more than doubled in 1943 , production of planes increased by 80 percent , and production time for &quot; Kri@@ eg@@ s@@ marine &quot; submarines was reduced from one year to two months .
production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944 .
</p>
<p>
in January 1944 , S@@ peer fell ill with complications from an inflamed knee , necessitating a leave .
according to S@@ peer &apos;s post @-@ war memoirs , his political rivals , attempted to have some of his powers permanently transferred to them during his absence .
S@@ peer claimed that SS chief Hein@@ rich H@@ imm@@ ler tried to have him physically isolated by having H@@ imm@@ ler &apos;s personal physician Karl Ge@@ b@@ hardt treat him , though his &quot; care &quot; did not improve his health .
S@@ peer &apos;s case was transferred to his friend Dr. Karl Bran@@ dt , and he slowly recovered .
in response to the Allied air raids on aircraft factories , Ad@@ olf Hitler authorised the creation of a J@@ ä@@ ger@@ stab , a governmental task force composed of Reich Aviation Ministry , Arma@@ ments Ministry and SS personnel .
its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production .
the task force was established by the 1 March 1944 order of S@@ peer , with support from Er@@ hard Mil@@ ch of the Reich Aviation Ministry .
S@@ peer and Mil@@ ch played a key role in directing the activities of the agency , while the day @-@ to @-@ day operations were handled by Chief of Staff Karl Sa@@ ur , the head of the Technical Office in the Arma@@ ments Ministry .
production continued to improve until late 1944 , with allied bombing destroying just 9 % of German production .
production of German fighter aircraft was more than doubled from 1943 to 1944 .
in April , S@@ peer &apos;s rivals for power succeeded in having him deprived of responsibility for construction .
S@@ peer sent Hitler a bitter letter , concluding with an offer of his resignation .
judging S@@ peer indispensable to the war effort , Field Marshal Er@@ hard Mil@@ ch persuaded Hitler to try to get his minister to reconsider .
Hitler sent Mil@@ ch to S@@ peer with a message not addressing the dispute but instead stating that he still regarded S@@ peer as highly as ever .
according to Mil@@ ch , upon hearing the message , S@@ peer burst out , &quot; The &quot; F@@ ü@@ hr@@ er &quot; can kiss my ass ! &quot; after a lengthy argument , Mil@@ ch persuaded S@@ peer to withdraw his offer of resignation , on the condition his powers were restored .
on April 23 , 1944 , S@@ peer went to see Hitler who agreed that &quot; everything &#91; will &#93; stay as it was , &#91; S@@ peer will &#93; remain the head of all German construction . &quot; according to S@@ peer , while he was successful in this debate , Hitler had also won , &quot; because he wanted and needed me back in his corner , and he got me . &quot; the J@@ ä@@ ger@@ stab was given extraordinary powers over labour , production and transportation resources , with its functions taking priority over housing repairs for bombed out civilians or restoration of vital city services .
the factories that came under the J@@ ä@@ ger@@ stab program saw their work @-@ weeks extended to 72 hours .
at the same time , Mil@@ ch took steps to ration@@ alise production by reducing the number of variants of each type of aircraft produced .
the J@@ ä@@ ger@@ stab was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of slave labour for the benefit of Germany &apos;s war industry and its air force , the Lu@@ f@@ tw@@ aff@@ e .
the task force immediately began implementing plans to expand the use of slave labour in the aviation manufacturing .
records show that SS provided 6@@ 4,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects at the peak of J@@ ä@@ ger@@ stab &apos;s construction activities .
taking into account the high mortality rate associated with the underground construction projects , the historian Marc Bu@@ gg@@ el@@ n estimates that the workforce involved amounted to 80,000 − 90,000 inmates .
they belonged to the various sub @-@ camps of Mit@@ tel@@ b@@ au @-@ D@@ ora , M@@ auth@@ aus@@ en @-@ Gus@@ en , Bu@@ ch@@ en@@ wald and other camps .
the prisoners worked for Jun@@ kers , Mes@@ ser@@ sch@@ mit@@ t , Hen@@ sch@@ el and BMW , among others .
the cooperation between the Reich Ministry of Aviation , the Ministry of Arma@@ ments and the SS proved especially productive .
although intended to function for only six months , already in late May S@@ peer and Mil@@ ch discussed with G@@ oring the possibility of centr@@ alising all of Germany &apos;s arms manufacturing under a similar task force .
on 1 August 1944 , S@@ peer re@@ organised the J@@ ä@@ ger@@ stab into the R@@ ü@@ stun@@ gs@@ stab to apply the same model of operation to all top @-@ priority armament programs .
the formation of the R@@ ü@@ stun@@ gs@@ stab allowed S@@ peer , for the first time , to consolidate key arms manufacturing projects for the three branches of the We@@ hr@@ mach@@ t under the authority of his ministry , further margin@@ alising the Reich Ministry of Aviation .
several departments , including the once powerful Technical Office , were disbanded or transferred to the new task force .
the task force oversaw the day @-@ to @-@ day development and production activities relating to the He 162 , the &quot; Vol@@ ks@@ j@@ ä@@ ger &quot; , as part of the Emergency Figh@@ ter Program .
the R@@ ü@@ stun@@ gs@@ stab assumed responsibilities for the underground transfer projects of the J@@ ä@@ ger@@ stab .
in November 1944 , 1.8 million square meters of underground space were ready for occupancy , encompassing over 1,000 spaces commissioned by the task force .
but by this time German production was beginning to collapse . .
according to Bu@@ gg@@ el@@ n , the R@@ ü@@ stun@@ gs@@ stab played a key role in maintaining and increasing production of fighter aircraft and V @-@ 2 rockets .

<p>
S@@ peer &apos;s name was included on the list of members of a post @-@ Hitler government drawn up by the conspir@@ ators behind the July 1944 assassination plot to kill Hitler .
the list had a question mark and the annotation &quot; to be won over &quot; by his name , which likely saved him from the extensive pur@@ ges that followed the scheme &apos;s failure .
when S@@ peer learned in February 1945 that the Red Army had overrun the Sil@@ esian industrial region , he drafted a memo to Hitler noting that Sil@@ esia &apos;s coal mines now supplied 60 percent of the Reich &apos;s coal .
without them , S@@ peer wrote , Germany &apos;s coal production would only be a quarter of its 1944 total - not nearly enough to continue the war .
he told Hitler in no uncertain terms that without Sil@@ esia , &quot; the war is lost . &quot; Hitler merely filed the memo in his safe .
by February 1945 , S@@ peer was working to supply areas about to be occupied with food and materials to get them through the hard times ahead .
on March 19 , 1945 , Hitler issued his N@@ ero Decree , ordering a scorched earth policy in both Germany and the occupied territories .
the plan included forcing millions of people on a long trek without food or supplies which would have resulted in a &quot; hunger catastrophe &quot; according to S@@ peer ;
Hitler had no comp@@ un@@ ction about this , believing that only the &quot; inferior ones &quot; would have survived the battles .
Hitler &apos;s order , by its terms , deprived S@@ peer of any power to interfere with the decree , and S@@ peer went to confront Hitler , reiterating that the war was lost .
Hitler gave S@@ peer 24 hours to reconsider his position , and when the two met the following day , S@@ peer answered , &quot; I stand unconditionally behind you . &quot; however , he demanded the exclusive power to implement the N@@ ero Decree , and Hitler signed an order to that effect .
using this order , S@@ peer worked to persuade generals and &quot; Gaul@@ e@@ iters &quot; to circumvent the N@@ ero Decree and avoid needless sacrifice of personnel and destruction of industry that would be needed after the war .
Shir@@ er describes this as a &quot; super@@ human effort &quot; by S@@ peer and a number of army officials , acting contrary to Hitler &apos;s orders , to save vital communications , plants and stores .
S@@ peer managed to reach a relatively safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed , but decided on a final , risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time .
S@@ peer stated at Nuremberg , &quot; I felt that it was my duty not to run away like a coward , but to stand up to him again . &quot; S@@ peer visited the &quot; F@@ ü@@ hr@@ er@@ bunker &quot; on April 22 .
Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted , and the two had a long , dis@@ jointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed S@@ peer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned .
in the published edition of &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; , S@@ peer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the N@@ ero Decree , but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty , bringing tears to the dictator &apos;s eyes .
S@@ peer bi@@ ographer Git@@ ta Ser@@ en@@ y argued , &quot; Psych@@ ologically , it is possible that this is the way he remembered the occasion , because it was how he would have liked to behave , and the way he would have liked Hitler to react . but the fact is that none of it happened ; our witness to this is S@@ peer himself . &quot; Ser@@ en@@ y notes that S@@ peer &apos;s original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler &apos;s tearful reaction , and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place , as had been alleged in a French magazine article .
the following morning , S@@ peer left the &quot; F@@ ü@@ hr@@ er@@ bunker &quot; ; Hitler cur@@ tly bade him farewell .
S@@ peer toured the damaged Chancell@@ ery one last time before leaving Berlin to return to Hamburg .
on April 29 , the day before committing suicide , Hitler dictated a final political testament which dropped S@@ peer from the successor government .
S@@ peer was to be replaced by his own subordinate , Karl @-@ Otto Sa@@ ur .
</p>
<p>
after Hitler &apos;s death , S@@ peer offered his services to the so @-@ called Fl@@ ens@@ burg Government , headed by Hitler &apos;s successor , Karl D@@ ö@@ nit@@ z , and took a significant role in that short @-@ lived regime as Minister of Industry and Production .
on May 15 , an Allied delegation arrived at Gl@@ ü@@ ck@@ sburg Castle , where S@@ peer had accommodations , and asked if he would be willing to provide information on the effects of the air war .
S@@ peer agreed , and over the next several days , provided information on a broad range of subjects .
on May 23 , two weeks after the surrender of German forces , British troops arrested the members of the Fl@@ ens@@ burg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end .
S@@ peer was taken to several internment centres for Nazi officials and interrogated .
in September 1945 , he was told that he would be tried for war crimes , and several days later , he was taken to Nuremberg and incarcerated there .
S@@ peer was indicted on all four possible counts : first , participating in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of crime against peace ; second , planning , initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace ; third , war crimes ; and lastly , crimes against humanity .
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson , the chief U.S. prosecutor at Nuremberg , alleged , &quot; S@@ peer joined in planning and executing the program to dra@@ goon prisoners of war and foreign workers into German war industries , which wa@@ xed in output while the workers waned in starvation . &quot; S@@ peer &apos;s attorney , Dr. Hans Fl@@ ä@@ ch@@ s@@ ner , presented S@@ peer as an artist thrust into political life , who had always remained a non @-@ ide@@ ologue and who had been promised by Hitler that he could return to architecture after the war .
during his testimony , S@@ peer accepted responsibility for the Nazi regime &apos;s actions .
an observer at the trial , journalist and author William L. Shir@@ er , wrote that , compared to his co@@ defendants , S@@ peer &quot; made the most straightforward impression of all and ... during the long trial spoke honestly and with no attempt to shirk his responsibility and his guilt . &quot; S@@ peer claimed that he had planned to kill Hitler in early 1945 by introducing ta@@ bun poison gas into the &quot; F@@ ü@@ hr@@ er@@ bunker &quot; ventilation shaft .
he said his efforts were frustrated by the im@@ practicability of ta@@ bun and his lack of ready access to a replacement nerve agent , and also by the unexpected construction of a tall chimney that put the air intake out of reach .
S@@ peer stated his motive was despair at realising that Hitler intended to take the German people down with him .
S@@ peer &apos;s supposed assassination plan subsequently met with some skepticism , with S@@ peer &apos;s architectural rival Her@@ mann Gi@@ es@@ ler sne@@ ering , &quot; the second most powerful man in the state did not have a ladder . &quot; S@@ peer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity , though he was acquitted on the other two counts .
his claim that he was unaware of Nazi extermination plans , which probably saved him from hanging , was finally revealed to be false in a private correspondence written in 1971 and publicly disclosed in 2007 .
on 1 October 1946 , he was sentenced to 20 years &apos; imprisonment .
while three of the eight judges initially advocated the death penalty for S@@ peer , the other judges did not , and a compromise sentence was reached &quot; after two days &apos; discussion and some rather bitter horse @-@ trading . &quot; the court &apos;s judgment stated that :
... in the closing stages of the war &#91; S@@ peer &#93; was one of the few men who had the courage to tell Hitler that the war was lost and to take steps to prevent the senseless destruction of production facilities , both in occupied territories and in Germany .
he carried out his opposition to Hitler &apos;s scorched earth programme ... by deliberately sabot@@ aging it at considerable personal risk .
</p>
<p>
: &quot; for additional detail on S@@ peer &apos;s time at Sp@@ and@@ au Prison , see Rud@@ olf Wol@@ ters # Sp@@ and@@ au years &quot; On July 18 , 1947 , S@@ peer and his six fellow prisoners , all former high officials of the Nazi regime , were flown from Nuremberg to Berlin under heavy guard .
they were taken to Sp@@ and@@ au Prison in the British Sector of what became West Berlin where they were designated by number , with S@@ peer given Number Five .
initially , the prisoners were kept in solitary confinement for all but half an hour a day and were not permitted to address each other or their guards .
as time passed , the strict regimen was relaxed , especially during the three months out of four that the three Western powers were in control ; the four occupying powers took overall control on a monthly rotation .
S@@ peer considered himself an out@@ cast among his fellow prisoners for his acceptance of responsibility at Nuremberg .
he made a deliberate effort to use his time as productively as possible .
he wrote , &quot; I am obsessed with the idea of using this time of confinement for writing a book of major importance ... That could mean transforming prison cell into scholar &apos;s den . &quot; the prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs , and mail was severely limited and censored .
however , S@@ peer was able to have his writings sent to Wol@@ ters as a result of an offer from a sympathetic orderly , and they eventually amounted to 20,000 sheets .
he had completed his memoirs by 1954 , which became the basis of &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; and which Wol@@ ters arranged to have transcri@@ bed onto 1,100 type@@ written pages .
he was also able to send letters and financial instructions and to obtain writing paper and letters from the outside .
his many letters to his children were secretly transmitted and eventually formed the basis for &quot; Sp@@ and@@ au : the Secret Di@@ aries &quot; .
with the draft memoir complete and clandestinely transmitted , S@@ peer sought a new project .
he found one while taking his daily exercise , walking in circles around the prison yard .
measuring the path &apos;s distance carefully , he set out to walk the distance from Berlin to Heid@@ elberg .
he then expanded his idea into a worldwide journey , visu@@ alizing the places that he was &quot; traveling &quot; through while walking the path around the prison yard .
he ordered guideb@@ ooks and other materials about the nations through which he imagined that he was passing so as to envision as accurate a picture as possible .
he meticulously calculated every meter traveled and mapped distances to the real @-@ world geography .
he began in northern Germany , passed through Asia by a southern route before entering Siberia , then crossed the B@@ ering Strait and continued south@@ wards , finally ending his sentence south of Guadal@@ ajara , Mexico .
S@@ peer devoted much of his time and energy to reading .
the prisoners brought some books with them in their personal property , but Sp@@ and@@ au Prison had no library ; books were sent from Sp@@ and@@ au &apos;s municipal library .
from 1952 , the prisoners were also able to order books from the Berlin central library in Wil@@ mer@@ s@@ dorf .
S@@ peer was a voracious reader and he completed well over 500 books in the first three years at Sp@@ and@@ au alone .
he read classic novels , travel@@ o@@ gues , books on ancient Egypt , and bi@@ ographies of such figures as Lucas Cran@@ ach , É@@ dou@@ ard Man@@ et , and Gen@@ ghis Khan .
he took to the prison garden for enjoyment and work , at first to do something constructive while afflicted with writer &apos;s block .
he was allowed to build an ambitious garden , transforming what he initially described as a &quot; wilderness &quot; into what the American commander at Sp@@ and@@ au described as &quot; S@@ peer &apos;s Garden of Eden . &quot; S@@ peer &apos;s supporters maintained a continual call for his release .
among those who pledged support for his sentence to be commuted were Charles de Gaulle , U.S. diplomat George Ball , former U.S. High Commissioner John J. Mc@@ Clo@@ y , and former Nuremberg prosecutor Har@@ tley Shaw@@ cross .
Wil@@ ly Bran@@ dt was a strong advocate of his release , sending flowers to his daughter on the day of his release and putting an end to the de @-@ Naz@@ ification proceedings against him , which could have caused his property to be confiscated .
a reduced sentence required the consent of all four of the occupying powers , and the Soviets adam@@ antly opposed any such proposal .
S@@ peer served his full sentence and was released at midnight on October 1 , 1966 .
</p>
<p>
S@@ peer &apos;s release from prison was a worldwide media event , as reporters and photographers crowded both the street outside Sp@@ and@@ au and the lobby of the Berlin hotel where S@@ peer spent his first hours of freedom in over 20 years .
he said little , reserving most comments for a major interview published in &quot; Der Spi@@ egel &quot; in November 1966 in which he again took personal responsibility for crimes of the Nazi regime .
he abandoned plans to return to architecture , as two proposed partners died shortly before his release .
instead , he revised his Sp@@ and@@ au writings into two autobi@@ ographical books , and later researched and published a work about H@@ imm@@ ler and the SS .
his books provide a unique and personal look into the personalities of the Nazi era , most notably &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; and &quot; Sp@@ and@@ au : the Secret Di@@ aries &quot; , and they have become much valued by historians .
S@@ peer was aided in shaping the works by Joachim F@@ est and Wolf J@@ ob@@ st Si@@ ed@@ ler from the publishing house Ul@@ l@@ stein .
he found himself unable to re @-@ establish his relationship with his children , even with his son Albert who had also become an architect .
according to S@@ peer &apos;s daughter Hilde , &quot; One by one my sister and brothers gave up . there was no communication . &quot; following the publication of his best@@ selling books , S@@ peer donated a considerable amount of money to Jewish charities .
according to Si@@ ed@@ ler , these donations were as high as 80 percent of his royalties .
S@@ peer kept the donations anonymous , both for fear of rejection and for fear of being called a hypocrit@@ e .
Wol@@ ters strongly objected to S@@ peer referring to Hitler in the memoirs as a criminal , and S@@ peer predicted as early as 1953 that he would lose a &quot; good many friends &quot; if the writings were published .
this came to pass following the publication of &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; , as close friends distan@@ ced themselves from him , such as Wol@@ ters and sculptor Ar@@ no Bre@@ ker .
Hitler &apos;s personal pilot Hans Ba@@ ur suggested that &quot; S@@ peer must have taken leave of his senses . &quot; Wol@@ ters wondered that S@@ peer did not now &quot; walk through life in a hair shirt , distributing his fortune among the victims of National Soci@@ alism , for@@ swear all the van@@ ities and pleasures of life and live on locusts and wild honey . &quot; S@@ peer made himself widely available to historians and other enqu@@ ir@@ ers .
he did an extensive , in @-@ depth interview for the June 1971 issue of &quot; Playboy &quot; magazine , in which he stated , &quot; If I didn &apos;t see it , then it was because I didn &apos;t want to see it . &quot; in October 1973 , S@@ peer made his first trip to Britain , flying to London under an assumed name to be interviewed by Lud@@ ovic Kennedy on the BBC &quot; Mid@@ week &quot; programme .
upon arrival , he was detained for almost eight hours at Heath@@ row Airport when British immigration authorities discovered his true identity .
home Secretary Robert Carr allowed him into the country for 48 hours .
in the same year , he appeared on the television programme &quot; The World at War &quot; .
S@@ peer returned to London in 1981 to participate in the BBC &quot; News@@ night &quot; programme ; while there , he suffered a stroke and died on September 1 .
he had formed a relationship with a German woman who was living in London ; he was with her at the time of his death .
even to the end of his life , S@@ peer continued to question his actions under Hitler .
he asks in his final book &quot; In@@ filtration &quot; , &quot; What would have happened if Hitler had asked me to make decisions that required the utmost hardness ? ... How far would I have gone ? ... If I had occupied a different position , to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had told me to do so ? &quot; S@@ peer leaves the questions unanswered .
</p>
<p>
the view of S@@ peer as an un@@ political &quot; miracle man &quot; is challenged by Columbia historian Adam T@@ oo@@ ze .
in his 2006 book , &quot; The Wages of Destruction &quot; , T@@ oo@@ ze , following Git@@ ta Ser@@ en@@ y , argues that S@@ peer &apos;s ideological commitment to the Nazi cause was greater than he claimed .
T@@ oo@@ ze further contends that an insufficiently challenged S@@ peer &quot; mythology &quot; had led many historians to assign S@@ peer far more credit for the increases in armaments production than was warranted and give insufficient consideration to the &quot; highly political &quot; function of the so @-@ called armaments miracle .
</p>

little remains of S@@ peer &apos;s personal architectural works , other than the plans and photographs .
no buildings designed by S@@ peer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin , other than the &quot; Sch@@ wer@@ bel@@ ast@@ ung@@ sk@@ ör@@ per &quot; , built around 1941 .
the high concrete cylinder was used to measure ground subsidence as part of feasibility studies for a massive triumph@@ al arch and other large structures proposed as part of &quot; Wel@@ th@@ au@@ p@@ t@@ st@@ ad@@ t Ger@@ mania &quot; , Hitler &apos;s planned postwar renewal project for the city .
the cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public .
along the Stra@@ sse des 17 .
Jun@@ i , a double row of lamp@@ posts designed by S@@ peer still stands .
the trib@@ une of the &quot; Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ inf@@ eld &quot; stadium in Nuremberg , though partly demolished , can also be seen .
more of S@@ peer &apos;s own personal work can be found in London , where he redesigned the interior of the German Embassy to the United Kingdom , then located at 7 @-@ 9 Carl@@ ton House Ter@@ race .
since 1967 , it has served as the offices of the Royal Society .
his work there , stripped of its Nazi fixtures and partially covered by carpets , survives in part .
another legacy was the &quot; Ar@@ be@@ its@@ stab Wi@@ e@@ der@@ au@@ f@@ b@@ au zer@@ st@@ ör@@ ter St@@ ä@@ d@@ te &quot; , authorised by S@@ peer in 1943 to rebuild bombed German cities to make them more li@@ vable in the age of the automobile .
headed by Wol@@ ters , the working group took a possible military defeat into their calculations .
the &quot; Ar@@ be@@ its@@ stab &quot; &apos; s recommendations served as the basis of the postwar redevelopment plans in many cities , and &quot; Ar@@ be@@ its@@ stab &quot; members became prominent in the rebuilding .

as General Building Inspector , S@@ peer was responsible for the Central Department for Resettlement .
from 1939 onward , the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non @-@ Jewish landlords in Berlin , to make way for non @-@ Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing .
eventually , 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures .
S@@ peer was aware of these activities , and inquired as to their progress .
at least one original memo from S@@ peer so inquiring still exists , as does the &quot; Chronicle &quot; of the Department &apos;s activities , kept by Wol@@ ters .
following his release from Sp@@ and@@ au , S@@ peer presented to the German Federal Archives an edited version of the &quot; Chronicle &quot; , stripped by Wol@@ ters of any mention of the Jews .
when David Ir@@ ving discovered discrepancies between the edited &quot; Chronicle &quot; and other documents , Wol@@ ters explained the situation to S@@ peer , who responded by suggesting to Wol@@ ters that the relevant pages of the original &quot; Chronicle &quot; should &quot; cease to exist . &quot; Wol@@ ters did not destroy the &quot; Chronicle &quot; , and , as his friendship with S@@ peer deteriorated , allowed access to the original &quot; Chronicle &quot; to doctoral student .
S@@ peer considered Wol@@ ters &apos; actions to be a &quot; betrayal &quot; and a &quot; stab in the back . &quot; the original &quot; Chronicle &quot; reached the Archives in 1983 , after both S@@ peer and Wol@@ ters had died .

<p>
S@@ peer maintained at Nuremberg and in his memoirs that he had no knowledge of the Holocaust .
he later wrote that in mid @-@ 1944 , he was told by Han@@ ke that the minister should never accept an invitation to inspect a concentration camp in neighbouring Upper Sil@@ esia , as &quot; he had seen something there which he was not permitted to describe and moreover could not describe . &quot; S@@ peer later concluded that Han@@ ke must have been speaking of Auschwitz and blamed himself for not inquiring further of Han@@ ke or seeking information from H@@ imm@@ ler or Hitler :
these seconds &#91; when Han@@ ke told S@@ peer this , and S@@ peer did not inquire &#93; were uppermost in my mind when I stated to the international court at the Nuremberg Trial that , as an important member of the leadership of the Reich , I had to share the total responsibility for all that had happened .
for from that moment on I was in@@ escap@@ ably contaminated morally ; from fear of discovering something which might have made me turn from my course , I had closed my eyes ...
because I failed at that time , I still feel , to this day , responsible for Auschwitz in a wholly personal sense .
historian Martin Kitchen indicates that S@@ peer and his team were in charge of building concentration camps and were thus intimately involved in the &quot; Final Solution . &quot; he refers to a letter dated 1 February 1943 from S@@ peer to H@@ imm@@ ler about concentration camps containing 40,000 Jews or White Russians , suggesting that S@@ peer had greater knowledge of the &quot; Final Solution &quot; than he admitted .
when questioned , S@@ peer denied any knowledge of this correspondence although it had gone out under his signature .
S@@ peer later insisted that he had tried to save some Jews from camps by using them in the armaments industry .
these were &quot; undernourished , over@@ worked slaves , &quot; according to Kitchen , who adds that the death rate was &quot; exceedingly high &quot; among such workers .
much of the controversy over S@@ peer &apos;s knowledge of the Holocaust has centered on his presence at the Po@@ sen Conference on October 6 , 1943 , at which H@@ imm@@ ler gave a speech detailing the ongoing Holocaust to Nazi leaders .
H@@ imm@@ ler said , &quot; The grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth ... In the lands we occupy , the Jewish question will be dealt with by the end of the year . &quot; S@@ peer is mentioned several times in the speech , and H@@ imm@@ ler seems to address him directly .
in &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; , S@@ peer mentions his own address to the officials but does not mention H@@ imm@@ ler &apos;s speech .
in October 1971 , American historian E@@ rich Gold@@ h@@ agen published an article arguing that S@@ peer was present for H@@ imm@@ ler &apos;s speech .
according to F@@ est in his biography of S@@ peer , &quot; Gold@@ h@@ agen &apos;s accusation certainly would have been more convincing &quot; had he not placed supposed incriminating statements linking S@@ peer with the Holocaust in quotation marks , attributed to H@@ imm@@ ler , which were in fact invented by Gold@@ h@@ agen .
in response , after considerable research in the German Federal Archives in K@@ obl@@ en@@ z , S@@ peer said he had left Po@@ sen around noon to journey to Hitler &apos;s headquarters at Rast@@ enburg .
in &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; , published before the Gold@@ h@@ agen article , S@@ peer recalled that on the evening after the conference , many Nazi officials were so drunk that they needed help boarding the special train which was to take them to a meeting with Hitler .
one of his bi@@ ographers , Dan van der V@@ at , suggests this necessarily implies he must have still been present at Po@@ sen then and must have heard H@@ imm@@ ler &apos;s speech .
in response to Gold@@ h@@ agen &apos;s article , S@@ peer had alleged that in writing &quot; Inside the Third Reich &quot; , he erred in reporting an incident that happened at another conference at Po@@ sen a year later , as happening in 1943 .
in 2007 , &quot; The Guardian &quot; reported that a letter from S@@ peer dated December 23 , 1971 , had been found in Britain in a collection of his correspondence to H@@ él@@ ène Je@@ anty , widow of a Belgian resistance fighter .
in the letter , S@@ peer states that he had been present for H@@ imm@@ ler &apos;s presentation in Po@@ sen .
S@@ peer wrote : &quot; there is no doubt - I was present as H@@ imm@@ ler announced on October 6 , 1943 , that all Jews would be killed . &quot; in her 1995 book &quot; Albert S@@ peer : his Battle with Truth &quot; , historian Git@@ ta Ser@@ en@@ y concludes that S@@ peer must have known about the Holocaust based on a letter he wrote after the war to the Jewish community in South Africa , and on the fact that his closest assistant attended the W@@ ann@@ see Conference where the details of the genocide of the Jews were worked out .
the assistant could not have failed to inform S@@ peer about the proceedings .
in 2005 , &quot; The Daily Telegraph &quot; reported that documents had surfaced indicating that S@@ peer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of Auschwitz after two of his assistants toured the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were killed .
the documents bore annotations in S@@ peer &apos;s own handwriting .
S@@ peer bi@@ ographer Git@@ ta Ser@@ en@@ y stated that , due to his workload , S@@ peer would not have been personally aware of such activities .
the debate over S@@ peer &apos;s knowledge of , or complicity in , the Holocaust made him a symbol for people who were involved with the Nazi regime yet did not have an active part in the regime &apos;s atrocities .
as film director Hein@@ rich Bre@@ lo@@ er remarked , &quot; &#91; S@@ peer created &#93; a market for people who said , &apos; Beli@@ eve me , I didn &apos;t know anything about &#91; the Holocaust &#93; . just look at the &quot; F@@ ü@@ hr@@ er &quot; s friend , he didn &apos;t know about it either .

Augu@@ sta Ad@@ a King , Coun@@ tess of Lov@@ el@@ ace was an English mathematician and writer , chiefly known for her work on Charles Bab@@ bage &apos;s proposed mechanical general @-@ purpose computer , the Analytical Engine .
she was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation , and published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine .
as a result , she is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a &quot; computing machine &quot; and the first computer programmer .
Lov@@ el@@ ace was the only legitimate child of the poet Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella &quot; Ann@@ ab@@ ella &quot; Mil@@ ban@@ ke , Lady W@@ ent@@ worth .
all of Byron &apos;s other children were born out of wedlock to other women .
Byron separated from his wife a month after Ad@@ a was born and left England forever four months later .
he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins , &quot; Is thy face like thy mother &apos;s my fair child ! Ad@@ a ! sole daughter of my house and heart ? . &quot; he died of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ad@@ a was eight years old .
her mother remained bitter and promoted Ad@@ a &apos;s interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father &apos;s perceived insanity .
despite this , Ad@@ a remained interested in Byron and was , upon her eventual death , buried next to him at her request .
she was often ill in her childhood .
Ad@@ a married William King in 18@@ 35 .
King was made Earl of Lov@@ el@@ ace in 18@@ 38 , Ad@@ a thereby becoming Coun@@ tess of Lov@@ el@@ ace .
her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Cro@@ sse , Sir David Brew@@ ster , Charles Whe@@ at@@ stone , Michael Far@@ ad@@ ay and the author Charles Dickens , contacts which she used to further her education .
Ad@@ a described her approach as &quot; poe@@ tical science &quot; and herself as an &quot; Analyst . &quot; when she was a teenager , her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Bab@@ bage , also known as &quot; the father of computers , &quot; and in particular , Bab@@ bage &apos;s work on the Analytical Engine .
Lov@@ el@@ ace first met him in June 1833 , through their mutual friend , and her private tutor , Mary Som@@ er@@ ville .
between 18@@ 42 and 18@@ 43 , Ad@@ a translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Men@@ ab@@ rea on the engine , supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes , simply called &quot; Notes &quot; .
these notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program - that is , an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine .
Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s notes are important in the early history of computers .
she also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number @-@ crun@@ ching , while many others , including Bab@@ bage himself , focused only on those capabilities .
her mindset of &quot; poe@@ tical science &quot; led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool .
she died of uterine cancer in 18@@ 52 at the age of 36 .
</p>
<p>
Lord Byron expected his child to be a &quot; glorious boy &quot; and was disappointed when Lady Byron gave birth to a girl .
the child was named after Byron &apos;s half @-@ sister , Augu@@ sta Le@@ igh , and was called &quot; Ad@@ a &quot; by Byron himself .
on 16 January 18@@ 16 , at Lord Byron &apos;s command , Lady Byron left for her parents &apos; home at Kirk@@ by Mall@@ ory , taking their five @-@ week @-@ old daughter with her .
although English law at the time granted full custody of children to the father in cases of separation , Lord Byron made no attempt to claim his parental rights , but did request that his sister keep him informed of Ad@@ a &apos;s welfare .
on 21 April , Lord Byron signed the deed of separation , although very reluctantly , and left England for good a few days later .
aside from an acri@@ mon@@ ious separation , Lady Byron continued throughout her life to make allegations about her husband &apos;s immoral behaviour .
this set of events made Lov@@ el@@ ace infamous in Victorian society .
she did not have a relationship with her father .
he died in 18@@ 24 when she was eight years old .
her mother was the only significant parental figure in her life .
Lov@@ el@@ ace was not shown the family portrait of her father until her 20th birthday .
Lov@@ el@@ ace did not have a close relationship with her mother .
she was often left in the care of her maternal grandmother Judith , Hon. Lady Mil@@ ban@@ ke , who d@@ oted on her .
however , because of societal attitudes of the time - which favoured the husband in any separation , with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation - Lady Byron had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society .
this included writing anxious letters to Lady Mil@@ ban@@ ke about her daughter &apos;s welfare , with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern .
in one letter to Lady Mil@@ ban@@ ke , she referred to her daughter as &quot; it &quot; :
&quot; I talk to it for your satisfaction , not my own , and shall be very glad when you have it under your own . &quot; Lady Byron had her teenage daughter watched by close friends for any sign of moral deviation .
Lov@@ el@@ ace dubbed these observers the &quot; Fu@@ ries &quot; and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her .
Lov@@ el@@ ace was often ill , beginning in early childhood .
at the age of eight , she experienced headaches that obscured her vision .
in June 18@@ 29 , she was paralysed after a bout of measles .
she was subjected to continuous bed rest for nearly a year , something which may have extended her period of disability .
by 18@@ 31 , she was able to walk with crutches .
despite the illnesses , she developed her mathematical and technological skills .
at the age of twelve , this future &quot; Lady F@@ airy , &quot; as Charles Bab@@ bage affection@@ ately called her , decided she wanted to fly .
Ad@@ a Byron went about the project metho@@ dically , thoughtfully , with imagination and passion .
her first step , in February 18@@ 28 , was to construct wings .
she investigated different material and sizes .
she considered various materials for the wings : paper , oil@@ silk , wires , and feathers .
she examined the anatomy of birds to determine the right proportion between the wings and the body .
she decided to write a book , &quot; F@@ ly@@ ology , &quot; illustrating , with plates , some of her findings .
she decided what equipment she would need ; for example , a compass , to &quot; cut across the country by the most direct road , &quot; so that she could surmount mountains , rivers , and valleys .
her final step was to integrate steam with the &quot; art of flying . &quot; in early 1833 , Ad@@ a Byron had an affair with a tutor .
after being caught , she tried to elope with him but the tutor &apos;s relatives recognised her and contacted her mother .
Lady Byron and her friends covered the incident up to prevent a public scandal .
Lov@@ el@@ ace never met her younger half @-@ sister , Alleg@@ ra , the daughter of Lord Byron and Claire Cla@@ ir@@ mont .
Alleg@@ ra died in 1822 at the age of five .
Lov@@ el@@ ace did have some contact with Elizabeth Med@@ ora Le@@ igh , the daughter of Byron &apos;s half @-@ sister Augu@@ sta Le@@ igh , who purposely avoided Lov@@ el@@ ace as much as possible when introduced at court .
</p>
<p>
Lov@@ el@@ ace became close friends with her tutor Mary Som@@ er@@ ville , who introduced her to Charles Bab@@ bage in 1833 .
she had a strong respect and affection for Som@@ er@@ ville , and they corresponded for many years .
other acquaintances included the scientists Andrew Cro@@ sse , Sir David Brew@@ ster , Charles Whe@@ at@@ stone , Michael Far@@ ad@@ ay and the author Charles Dickens .
she was presented at Court at the age of seventeen &quot; and became a popular belle of the season &quot; in part because of her &quot; brilliant mind . &quot; by 18@@ 34 Ad@@ a was a regular at Court and started attending various events .
she danced often and was able to charm many people , and was described by most people as being dain@@ ty , although John Hob@@ house , Byron &apos;s friend , described her as &quot; a large , coarse @-@ skinned young woman but with something of my friend &apos;s features , particularly the mouth . &quot; this description followed their meeting on 24 February 18@@ 34 in which Ad@@ a made it clear to Hob@@ house that she did not like him , probably due to her mother &apos;s influence , which led her to dislike all of her father &apos;s friends .
this first impression was not to last , and they later became friends .
on 8 July 18@@ 35 , she married William , 8th Baron King , becoming Lady King .
they had three homes : Oc@@ k@@ ham Park , Surrey ; a Scottish estate on Lo@@ ch Tor@@ ri@@ don in Ross @-@ shire ; and a house in London .
they spent their honeymoon at Wor@@ thy Man@@ or in Ashley Com@@ be near Por@@ lock We@@ ir , Som@@ er@@ set .
the Man@@ or had been built as a hunting lodge in 17@@ 99 and was improved by King in preparation for their honeymoon .
it later became their summer retreat and was further improved during this time .
from 18@@ 45 , the family &apos;s main house was East Hor@@ sley Towers , rebuilt in the Victorian Gothic fashion by the architect of the Houses of Parliament , Charles Barry .
they had three children : Byron ; Anne Isabella ; and Ralph Gordon .
immediately after the birth of Ann@@ ab@@ ella , Lady King experienced &quot; a tedious and suffering illness , which took months to cure . &quot; Ad@@ a was a descendant of the extinct Bar@@ ons Lov@@ el@@ ace and in 18@@ 38 , her husband was made Earl of Lov@@ el@@ ace and Vis@@ count Oc@@ k@@ ham , meaning Ad@@ a became the Coun@@ tess of Lov@@ el@@ ace .
in 18@@ 43 @-@ 44 , Ad@@ a &apos;s mother assigned William Benjamin Car@@ pen@@ ter to teach Ad@@ a &apos;s children and to act as a &quot; moral &quot; instructor for Ad@@ a .
he quickly fell for her and encouraged her to express any frustrated affections , claiming that his marriage meant he would never act in an &quot; un@@ becoming &quot; manner .
when it became clear that Car@@ pen@@ ter was trying to start an affair , Ad@@ a cut it off .
in 18@@ 41 , Lov@@ el@@ ace and Med@@ ora Le@@ igh were told by Ad@@ a &apos;s mother that her father was also Med@@ ora &apos;s father .
on 27 February 18@@ 41 , Ad@@ a wrote to her mother :
&quot; I am not in the least &quot; astonished &quot; . in fact , you merely &quot; confirm &quot; what I have for &quot; years and years &quot; felt scarcely a doubt about , but should have considered it most improper in me to hint to you that I in any way suspected . &quot; she did not blame the inc@@ est@@ uous relationship on Byron , but instead blamed Augu@@ sta Le@@ igh :
&quot; I fear she is more inherently wicked than he ever was . &quot; in the 18@@ 40s , Ad@@ a flir@@ ted with scandals : firstly , from a relaxed approach to extra @-@ marital relationships with men , leading to rumours of affairs ; and secondly , from her love of gambling .
she apparently lost more than £ 3,000 on the horses during the later 18@@ 40s .
the gambling led to her forming a syndicate with male friends , and an ambitious attempt in 18@@ 51 to create a mathematical model for successful large bets .
this went disastr@@ ously wrong , leaving her thousands of pounds in debt to the syndicate , forcing her to admit it all to her husband .
she had a shadowy relationship with Andrew Cro@@ sse &apos;s son John from 1844 onwards .
John Cro@@ sse destroyed most of their correspondence after her death as part of a legal agreement .
she beque@@ athed him the only he@@ ir@@ looms her father had personally left to her .
during her final illness , she would panic at the idea of the younger Cro@@ sse being kept from visiting her .
</p>
<p>
throughout her illnesses , she continued her education .
her mother &apos;s obsession with rooting out any of the insanity of which she accused Byron was one of the reasons that Ad@@ a was taught mathematics from an early age .
she was privately school@@ ed in mathematics and science by William Fr@@ end , William King , and Mary Som@@ er@@ ville , the noted 19th @-@ century researcher and scientific author .
one of her later tutors was the mathematician and log@@ ician August@@ us De Morgan .
from 18@@ 32 , when she was seventeen , her mathematical abilities began to emerge , and her interest in mathematics dominated the majority of her adult life .
in a letter to Lady Byron , De Morgan suggested that her daughter &apos;s skill in mathematics could lead her to become &quot; an original mathematical investigator , perhaps of first @-@ rate eminence . &quot; Lov@@ el@@ ace often questioned basic assumptions by integrating poetry and science .
while studying differential calculus , she wrote to De Morgan :
I may remark that the curious transformations many formulae can undergo , the un@@ suspected and to a beginner apparently impossible identity of forms exceedingly dissimilar at first sight , is I think one of the chief difficulties in the early part of mathematical studies .
I am often reminded of certain spr@@ ites and fairies one reads of , who are at one &apos;s elbows in &quot; one &quot; shape now , and the next minute in a form most dissimilar Lov@@ el@@ ace believed that intuition and imagination were critical to effectively applying mathematical and scientific concepts .
she valued metaphysics as much as mathematics , viewing both as tools for exploring &quot; the unseen worlds around us . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Lov@@ el@@ ace died at the age of 36 - the same age at which her father had died - on 27 November 18@@ 52 , from uterine cancer probably exacerbated by blood@@ letting by her physicians .
the illness lasted several months , in which time Ann@@ ab@@ ella took command over whom Ad@@ a saw , and excluded all of her friends and confid@@ ants .
under her mother &apos;s influence , she had a religious transformation and was co@@ axed into re@@ penting of her previous conduct and making Ann@@ ab@@ ella her execu@@ tor .
she lost contact with her husband after conf@@ essing something to him on 30 August which caused him to abandon her bedside .
it is not known what she told him .
she was buried , at her request , next to her father at the Church of St. Mary Magdal@@ ene in Hu@@ ck@@ n@@ all , Notting@@ ham@@ shire .
a memorial plaque in Latin to her and her father is in the chapel attached to Hor@@ sley Towers .
</p>
<p>
throughout her life , Lov@@ el@@ ace was strongly interested in scientific developments and f@@ ads of the day , including ph@@ ren@@ ology and mes@@ mer@@ ism .
after her work with Bab@@ bage , Lov@@ el@@ ace continued to work on other projects .
in 1844 she commented to a friend Wor@@ on@@ z@@ ow Gre@@ ig about her desire to create a mathematical model for how the brain gives rise to thoughts and nerves to feelings .
she never achieved this , however .
in part , her interest in the brain came from a long @-@ running pre @-@ occupation , inherited from her mother , about her &apos; potential &apos; madness .
as part of her research into this project , she visited the electrical engineer Andrew Cro@@ sse in 1844 to learn how to carry out electrical experiments .
in the same year , she wrote a review of a paper by Baron Karl von Re@@ ic@@ hen@@ bach , &quot; Resear@@ ches on Magne@@ tism &quot; , but this was not published and does not appear to have progressed past the first draft .
in 18@@ 51 , the year before her cancer struck , she wrote to her mother mentioning &quot; certain productions &quot; she was working on regarding the relation of maths and music .
Lov@@ el@@ ace first met Charles Bab@@ bage in June 1833 , through their mutual friend Mary Som@@ er@@ ville .
later that month Bab@@ bage invited Lov@@ el@@ ace to see the prototype for his Difference Engine .
she became fascinated with the machine and used her relationship with Som@@ er@@ ville to visit Bab@@ bage as often as she could .
Bab@@ bage was impressed by Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s intellect and analytic skills .
he called her &quot; The En@@ chan@@ tress of Number . &quot; in 18@@ 43 he wrote to her :
forget this world and all its troubles and if possible its multi@@ t@@ ud@@ inous Char@@ lat@@ ans - every thing in short but the En@@ chan@@ tress of Number .
during a nine @-@ month period in 18@@ 42 @-@ 43 , Lov@@ el@@ ace translated the Italian mathematician Luigi Men@@ ab@@ rea &apos;s article on Bab@@ bage &apos;s newest proposed machine , the Analytical Engine .
with the article , she appended a set of notes .
explaining the Analytical Engine &apos;s function was a difficult task , as even many other scientists did not really grasp the concept and the British establishment was un@@ interested in it .
Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s notes even had to explain how the Analytical Engine differed from the original Difference Engine .
her work was well received at the time ; the scientist Michael Far@@ ad@@ ay described himself as a supporter of her writing .
the notes are around three times longer than the article itself and include , in complete detail , a method for calculating a sequence of Bern@@ oul@@ li numbers with the Engine , which could have run correctly had Bab@@ bage &apos;s Analytical Engine been built .
based on this work , Lov@@ el@@ ace is now widely considered to be the first computer programmer and her method is recognised as the world &apos;s first computer program .
section G also contains Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s dismissal of artificial intelligence .
she wrote that &quot; The Analytical Engine has no pre@@ tensions whatever to &quot; originate &quot; anything . it can do &quot; whatever we know how to order it &quot; to perform . it can follow analysis ; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths . &quot; this objection has been the subject of much debate and rebuttal , for example by Alan Tur@@ ing in his paper &quot; Computing Machinery and Intelligence . &quot; Lov@@ el@@ ace and Bab@@ bage had a minor falling out when the papers were published , when he tried to leave his own statement as an unsigned preface - which would imply that she had written that also .
when Taylor &apos;s &quot; Scientific M@@ emo@@ irs &quot; ruled that the statement should be signed , Bab@@ bage wrote to Lov@@ el@@ ace asking her to withdraw the paper .
this was the first that she knew he was leaving it unsigned , and she wrote back refusing to withdraw the paper .
the historian Benjamin Wool@@ ley theor@@ ised that : &quot; his actions suggested he had so enthusiastically sought Ad@@ a &apos;s involvement , and so happily indulged her ... because of her &apos; celebrated name &apos; . &quot; their friendship recovered , and they continued to correspond .
on 12 August 18@@ 51 , when she was dying of cancer , Lov@@ el@@ ace wrote to him asking him to be her execu@@ tor , though this letter did not give him the necessary legal authority .
part of the terrace at Wor@@ thy Man@@ or was known as &quot; Philos@@ opher &apos;s Walk &quot; , as it was there that Lov@@ el@@ ace and Bab@@ bage were reputed to have walked while discussing mathematical principles .
</p>
<p>
in 1840 , Bab@@ bage was invited to give a seminar at the University of Turin about his Analytical Engine .
Luigi Men@@ ab@@ rea , a young Italian engineer and the future Prime Minister of Italy , transcri@@ bed Bab@@ bage &apos;s lecture into French , and this transcript was subsequently published in the Bi@@ bl@@ io@@ th@@ è@@ que univer@@ selle de Gen@@ è@@ ve in October 18@@ 42 .
Bab@@ bage &apos;s friend Charles Whe@@ at@@ stone commissioned Ad@@ a Lov@@ el@@ ace to translate Men@@ ab@@ rea &apos;s paper into English .
she then augmented the paper with notes , which were added to the translation .
Ad@@ a Lov@@ el@@ ace spent the better part of a year doing this , assisted with input from Bab@@ bage .
these notes , which are more extensive than Men@@ ab@@ rea &apos;s paper , were then published in the September 18@@ 43 edition of Taylor &apos;s &quot; Scientific M@@ emo@@ irs &quot; under the initi@@ alism &quot; A@@ AL &quot; .
Ad@@ a Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s notes were labelled alphabe@@ tically from A to G. In note G , she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bern@@ oul@@ li numbers .
it is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer , and Ad@@ a Lov@@ el@@ ace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason .
the engine was never completed so her program was never tested .
in 1953 , more than a century after her death , Ad@@ a Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s notes on Bab@@ bage &apos;s Analytical Engine were re@@ published as an appendix to B.@@ V. Bow@@ den &apos;s &quot; F@@ aster than Thought : a Symposium on Digital Computing Machines &quot; .
the engine has now been recognised as an early model for a computer and her notes as a description of a computer and software .
</p>
<p>
in her notes , Lov@@ el@@ ace emphasised the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines , particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity .
she realised the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crun@@ ching .
in her notes , she wrote : &#91; the Analytical Engine &#93; might act upon other things besides &quot; number &quot; , were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations , and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine ... Sup@@ posing , for instance , that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations , the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent .
this analysis was an important development from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices and anticipated the implications of modern computing one hundred years before they were realised .
Walter Isa@@ ac@@ son ascri@@ bes Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s insight regarding the application of computing to &quot; any &quot; process based on logical symbols to an observation about textiles :
&quot; when she saw some mechanical looms that used pun@@ ch@@ cards to direct the weaving of beautiful patterns , it reminded her of how Bab@@ bage &apos;s engine used punched cards to make calculations . &quot; this insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty To@@ ole and Benjamin Wool@@ ley , as well as the programmer John Graham @-@ Cum@@ ming , whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine .
according to the historian of computing and Bab@@ bage specialist Dor@@ on Sw@@ ade :
Ad@@ a saw something that Bab@@ bage in some sense failed to see .
in Bab@@ bage &apos;s world his engines were bound by number ... What Lov@@ el@@ ace saw - what Ad@@ a Byron saw - was that number could represent entities other than quantity .
so once you had a machine for manipulating numbers , if those numbers represented other things , letters , musical notes , then the machine could manipulate symbols of which number was one instance , according to rules .
it is this fundamental transition from a machine which is a number crun@@ cher to a machine for manipulating symbols according to rules that is the fundamental transition from calculation to computation - to general @-@ purpose computation - and looking back from the present high ground of modern computing , if we are looking and si@@ fting history for that transition , then that transition was made explicitly by Ad@@ a in that 18@@ 43 paper .

though Lov@@ el@@ ace is referred to as the first computer programmer , some bi@@ ographers , computer scientists and historians of computing claim otherwise .
Allan G. Brom@@ ley , in the 1990 article &quot; Difference and Analytical Eng@@ ines &quot; :
all but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Bab@@ bage from three to seven years earlier .
the exception was prepared by Bab@@ bage for her , although she did detect a &apos; bug &apos; in it .
not only is there no evidence that Ad@@ a ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine , but her correspondence with Bab@@ bage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so .
Bruce Col@@ lier , who later wrote a biography of Bab@@ bage , wrote in his 1970 Harvard University PhD thesis that Lov@@ el@@ ace &quot; made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine , but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way . &quot; Eugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra To@@ ole consider it &quot; incorrect &quot; to regard Lov@@ el@@ ace as the first computer programmer , as Bab@@ bage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine , although the majority were never published .
Brom@@ ley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Bab@@ bage between 18@@ 37 and 1840 , all substantially pre@@ dating Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s notes .
Dorothy K. Ste@@ in regards Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s notes as &quot; more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author , the political purposes of the inventor , and , above all , of the social and cultural context in which it was written , than a blueprint for a scientific development . &quot; in his book , &quot; Idea M@@ akers &quot; , Stephen Wol@@ fra@@ m defends Lov@@ el@@ ace &apos;s contributions .
# She was a mathematical genius # She made an influential contribution to the analytical engine # She was the first computer programmer # She was a prophet of the computer age According to him , only the fourth claim had &quot; any substance at all . &quot; he explained that Ad@@ a was only a &quot; promising beginner &quot; instead of genius in mathematics , that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Bab@@ bage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it , and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it .
but he agrees that Ad@@ a was the only person to see the potential of the analytical engine as a machine capable of expressing entities other than quantities .

August William Der@@ leth was an American writer and anth@@ ologist .
though best remembered as the first book publisher of the writings of H. P. Lov@@ ecraft , and for his own contributions to the C@@ th@@ ul@@ hu My@@ thos and the Co@@ sm@@ ic Hor@@ ror genre , as well as his founding of the publisher Ark@@ ham House , Der@@ leth was a leading American regional writer of his day , as well as prolific in several other genres , including historical fiction , poetry , detective fiction , science fiction , and biography .
a 1938 Gu@@ g@@ gen@@ heim Fellow , Der@@ leth considered his most serious work to be the ambitious &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga &quot; , a series of fiction , historical fiction , poetry , and non @-@ fiction natur@@ alist works designed to mem@@ ori@@ alize life in the Wisconsin he knew .
Der@@ leth can also be considered a pioneering natur@@ alist and conserv@@ ationist in his writing .
</p>
<p>
the son of William Julius Der@@ leth and Rose Louise Vol@@ k , Der@@ leth grew up in Sau@@ k City , Wisconsin .
he was educated in local par@@ och@@ ial and public high school .
Der@@ leth wrote his first fiction at age 13 .
he was interested most in reading , and he made three trips to the library a week .
he would save his money to buy books .
some of his biggest influences were Ralph Wal@@ do Emerson &apos;s essays , Walt Whitman , H. L. M@@ enc@@ ken &apos;s &quot; The American Mercury &quot; , Samuel Johnson &apos;s &quot; The History of Ras@@ sel@@ as , Prince of Ab@@ iss@@ inia &quot; , Alexandre Dum@@ as , Edgar Allan Po@@ e , Walter Scott , and Henry David Thore@@ au &apos;s Wal@@ den .
forty rejected stories and three years later , according to anth@@ ologist Jim Steph@@ ens , he sold his first story , &quot; B@@ at &apos;s Bel@@ fry , &quot; to &quot; We@@ ir@@ d T@@ ales &quot; magazine .
Der@@ leth wrote throughout his four years at the University of Wisconsin , where he received a B.A. in 1930 .
during this time he also served briefly as associate editor of Minneapolis @-@ based Faw@@ c@@ ett Publications &quot; M@@ ys@@ tic Magazine &quot; .
returning to Sau@@ k City in the summer of 1931 , Der@@ leth worked in a local canning factory and collaborated with childhood friend Mark Sch@@ or@@ er .
they rented a cabin , writing Gothic and other horror stories and selling them to &quot; We@@ ir@@ d T@@ ales &quot; magazine .
Der@@ leth won a place on the O &apos;Brien Roll of Honor for &quot; Five Al@@ one &quot; , published in &quot; Place of Haw@@ ks &quot; , but was first found in &quot; P@@ ag@@ any &quot; magazine .
as a result of his early work on the &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga &quot; , Der@@ leth was awarded the prestigious Gu@@ g@@ gen@@ heim Fellowship ; his sponsors were Helen C. White , Nobel Prize @-@ winning novelist Sinclair Lewis and poet Edgar Lee Masters of &quot; Spo@@ on River Anth@@ ology &quot; fame .
in the mid @-@ 1930s , Der@@ leth organized a R@@ anger &apos;s Club for young people , served as clerk and president of the local school board , served as a parole officer , organized a local men &apos;s club and a parent @-@ teacher association .
&quot; an Aut@@ obi@@ ography . &quot; he also lectured in American regional literature at the University of Wisconsin and was a contributing editor of &quot; Out@@ doors Magazine &quot; .
with longtime friend Donald Wan@@ dre@@ i , Der@@ leth in 1939 founded Ark@@ ham House .
its initial objective was to publish the works of H. P. Lov@@ ecraft , with whom Der@@ leth had corresponded since his teenage years .
at the same time , he began teaching a course in American Regional Literature at the University of Wisconsin .
in 1941 , he became literary editor of &quot; The Capital Times &quot; newspaper in Madison , a post he held until his resignation in 1960 .
his hobbies included fencing , swimming , chess , phil@@ ately and comic @-@ strips .
Der@@ leth &apos;s true av@@ ocation , however , was hiking the terrain of his native Wisconsin lands , and observing and recording nature with an expert eye .
Der@@ leth once wrote of his writing methods , &quot; I write very swiftly , from 750,000 to a million words yearly , very little of it pulp material . &quot; in 1948 , he was elected president of the Associated F@@ ant@@ asy Publishers at the 6th World Science Fic@@ tion Convention in Toronto .
he was married April 6 , 1953 , to Sandra Evelyn W@@ inters .
they divorced six years later .
Der@@ leth retained custody of the couple &apos;s two children , April Rose and Wal@@ den William .
April earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison in 1977 .
she became majority stock@@ holder , President , and CEO of Ark@@ ham House in 1994 .
she remained in that capacity until her death .
she was known in the community as a natur@@ alist and humanitarian .
April died on March 21 , 2011 .
in 1960 , Der@@ leth began editing and publishing a magazine called &quot; Haw@@ k and W@@ hip@@ poor@@ will &quot; , dedicated to poems of man and nature .
Der@@ leth died of a heart attack on July 4 , 1971 , and is buried in St. A@@ loy@@ sius Cemetery in Sau@@ k City .
the U.S. 12 bridge over the Wisconsin River is named in his honor .
Der@@ leth was Roman Catholic .
</p>
<p>
Der@@ leth wrote more than 150 short stories and more than 100 books during his lifetime .
</p>
<p>
Der@@ leth wrote an expansive series of novels , short stories , journals , poems , and other works about S@@ ac Pra@@ irie .
Der@@ leth intended this series to comprise up to 50 novels telling the projected life @-@ story of the region from the 19th century onwards , with analog@@ ies to Bal@@ z@@ ac &apos;s &quot; Human Com@@ edy &quot; and Prou@@ st &apos;s &quot; Remembrance of Things Past &quot; .
this , and other early work by Der@@ leth , made him a well @-@ known figure among the regional literary figures of his time : early Pul@@ itzer Prize winners Ham@@ lin Gar@@ land and Z@@ ona G@@ ale , as well as Sinclair Lewis , the last both an admirer and critic of Der@@ leth .
&quot; what Der@@ leth accomplished .... was to gather a Wisconsin my@@ thos which gave respect to the ancient funda@@ ment of our contemporary life . &quot; the author inaugurated the &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga &quot; with four nov@@ ell@@ as comprising &quot; Place of Haw@@ ks &quot; , published by L@@ oring &amp; Mus@@ sey in 1935 .
at publication , &quot; The Detroit News &quot; wrote : &quot; certainly with this book Mr. Der@@ leth may be added to the American writers of distinction . &quot; Der@@ leth &apos;s first novel , &quot; Still is the Summer Night &quot; , was published two years later by the famous Charles S@@ cri@@ b@@ ners &apos; editor Maxwell Per@@ kins , and was the second in his S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga . &quot;
village Year &quot; , the first in a series of journals @-@ med@@ itations on nature , Mid@@ western village American life , and more @-@ was published in 1941 to praise from &quot; The New York Times Book Review &quot; :
this work Der@@ leth considered among his finest .
what &quot; The Milwaukee Journal &quot; called &quot; this beautiful little love story , &quot; is an autobi@@ ographical novel of first love beset by small @-@ town religious bigotry .
the work received critical praise : &quot; the New Yor@@ ker &quot; considered it a story told &quot; with tenderness and charm , &quot; while the &quot; Chicago Tribune &quot; concluded :
&quot; it &apos;s as though he turned back the pages of an old diary and told , with re@@ kindled emotion , of the pan@@ gs of pain and the sharp , clear sweetness of a boy &apos;s first love . &quot; Helen Con@@ stance White , wrote in &quot; The Capital Times &quot; that it was ... &quot; the best articulated , the most fully disciplined of his stories . &quot; these were followed in 1943 with &quot; Shadow of Night &quot; , a S@@ cri@@ b@@ ners &apos; novel of which &quot; The Chicago Sun &quot; wrote :
&quot; structurally it has the perfection of a carved jewel ... A psychological novel of the first order , and an adventure tale that is unique and inspi@@ riting . &quot; in November 1945 , however , Der@@ leth &apos;s work was attacked by his one @-@ time admirer and mentor , Sinclair Lewis .
a lighter side to the &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga &quot; is a series of quasi @-@ autobi@@ ographical short stories known as the &quot; G@@ us El@@ ker Stories , &quot; amusing tales of country life that Peter Ru@@ ber , Der@@ leth &apos;s last editor , said were ... &quot; models of construction and ... fused with some of the most memorable characters in American literature . &quot; most were written between 1934 and the late 1940s , though the last , &quot; Ta@@ il of the Dog , &quot; was published in 1959 and won the &quot; Schol@@ astic Magazine &quot; short story award for the year .
the series was collected and re@@ published in &quot; Country Matters &quot; in 1996 . &quot;
Wal@@ den West &quot; , published in 1961 , is considered by many Der@@ leth &apos;s finest work .
this prose meditation is built out of the same fundamental material as the series of S@@ ac Pra@@ irie journals , but is organized around three themes :
&quot; the persistence of memory ... the sounds and odors of the country ... and Thore@@ au &apos;s observation that the &apos; mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation . &apos; &quot; a blend of nature writing , philosoph@@ ic mus@@ ings , and careful observation of the people and place of &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie . &quot; of this work , George Vuk@@ el@@ ich , author of &quot; North Country Not@@ ebook , &quot; writes :
&quot; Der@@ leth &apos;s &quot; Wal@@ den West &quot; is ... the equal of Sher@@ wood Anderson &apos;s &quot; Win@@ esburg , Ohio &quot; , Thorn@@ ton Wil@@ der &apos;s &quot; Our Town &quot; , and Edgar Lee Masters &apos; &quot; Spo@@ on River Anth@@ ology &quot; . &quot; this was followed eight years later by &quot; Return to Wal@@ den West &quot; , a work of similar quality , but with a more noticeable environment@@ alist edge to the writing , notes critic Nor@@ bert B@@ lei .
a close literary relative of the &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga &quot; was Der@@ leth &apos;s &quot; Wisconsin S@@ aga &quot; , which comprises several historical novels .
</p>
<p>
detective fiction represented another substantial body of Der@@ leth &apos;s work .
most notable among this work was a series of 70 stories in affectionate pas@@ ti@@ che of Sher@@ lock Holmes , whose creator , Sir Arthur Con@@ an Doyle , he admired greatly .
these included one published novel as well .
the series features a British detective named Solar P@@ ons , of Pra@@ ed Street in London .
the series was greatly admired by such notable writers and critics of mystery and detective fiction as El@@ lery Queen , Anthony Bou@@ cher , Vincent Star@@ rett and Howard Hay@@ craft .
in his 1944 volume &quot; The Mis@@ adventures of Sher@@ lock Holmes &quot; , El@@ lery Queen wrote of Der@@ leth &apos;s &quot; The Nor@@ cross R@@ iddle &quot; , an early P@@ ons story :
though Der@@ leth never wrote a P@@ ons novel to equal &quot; The H@@ ound of the Bas@@ ker@@ vill@@ es &quot; , editor Peter Ru@@ ber wrote :
... &quot; Der@@ leth produced more than a few Solar P@@ ons stories almost as good as Sir Arthur &apos;s , and many that had better plot construction . &quot; although these stories were a form of diversion for Der@@ leth , Ru@@ ber , who edited &quot; The Original Text Solar P@@ ons Om@@ ni@@ bus Edition &quot; , argued :
&quot; because the stories were generally of such high quality , they ought to be assessed on their own merits as a unique contribution in the annals of mystery fiction , rather than suffering comparison as one of the endless im@@ itators of Sher@@ lock Holmes . &quot; some of the stories were self @-@ published , through a new imprint called &quot; My@@ cro@@ ft &amp; Mor@@ an , &quot; an app@@ ellation of humorous significance to Hol@@ me@@ sian scholars .
for approximately a decade , an active supporting group was the Pra@@ ed Street Ir@@ regul@@ ars , patterned after the Baker Street Ir@@ regul@@ ars .
in 1946 , Con@@ an Doyle &apos;s two sons made some attempts to force Der@@ leth to cease publishing the Solar P@@ ons series , but the efforts were unsuccessful and eventually withdrawn .
Der@@ leth &apos;s mystery and detective fiction also included a series of works set in S@@ ac Pra@@ irie and featuring Judge P@@ eck as the central character .
</p>
<p>
Der@@ leth wrote many and varied children &apos;s works , including bi@@ ographies meant to introduce younger readers to explorer Fr .
Mar@@ quette , as well as Ralph Wal@@ do Emerson and Henry David Thore@@ au .
arguably most important among his works for younger readers , however , is the Steve and S@@ im My@@ stery Series , also known as the Mill Creek Ir@@ regul@@ ars series .
the ten @-@ volume series , published between 1958 and 1970 , is set in S@@ ac Pra@@ irie of the 1920s and can thus be considered in its own right a part of the &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga &quot; , as well as an extension of Der@@ leth &apos;s body of mystery fiction .
Robert Hood , writing in the &quot; New York Times &quot; said :
&quot; Steve and S@@ im , the major characters , are twentieth @-@ century cousins of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer ;
Der@@ leth &apos;s minor characters , little gems of comic drawing . &quot; the first novel in the series , &quot; The Moon T@@ enders &quot; , does , in fact , involve a ra@@ fting adventure down the Wisconsin River , which led regional writer Jesse Stuart to suggest the novel was one that &quot; older people might read to recapture the spirit and dream of youth . &quot; the connection to the &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga &quot; was noted by the &quot; Chicago Tribune &quot; :
&quot; once again a small mid@@ west community in 1920s is depicted with perception , skill , and dry humor . &quot;

<p>
Der@@ leth was a correspondent and friend of H. P. Lov@@ ecraft - when Lov@@ ecraft wrote about &quot; le Com@@ te d &apos;@@ Er@@ lette &quot; in his fiction , it was in homage to Der@@ leth .
Der@@ leth invented the term &quot; C@@ th@@ ul@@ hu My@@ thos &quot; to describe the fictional universe described in the series of stories shared by Lov@@ ecraft and other writers in his circle .
when Lov@@ ecraft died in 1937 , Der@@ leth and Donald Wan@@ dre@@ i assembled a collection of Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s stories and tried to get them published .
existing publishers showed little interest , so Der@@ leth and Wan@@ dre@@ i founded Ark@@ ham House in 1939 for that purpose .
the name of the company derived from Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s fictional town of Ark@@ ham , Massachusetts , which features in many of his stories .
in 1939 Ark@@ ham House published &quot; The Out@@ sider and Others &quot; , a huge collection that contained most of Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s known short stories .
Der@@ leth and Wan@@ dre@@ i soon expanded Ark@@ ham House and began a regular publishing schedule after its second book , &quot; Someone in the Dark &quot; , a collection of some of Der@@ leth &apos;s own horror stories , was published in 1941 .
following Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s death , Der@@ leth wrote a number of stories based on fragments and notes left by Lov@@ ecraft .
these were published in &quot; We@@ ir@@ d T@@ ales &quot; and later in book form , under the by@@ line &quot; H. P. Lov@@ ecraft and August Der@@ leth , &quot; with Der@@ leth calling himself a &quot; pos@@ thum@@ ous collabor@@ ator . &quot; this practice has raised objections in some quarters that Der@@ leth simply used Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s name to market what was essentially his own fiction ;
S. T. Jo@@ shi refers to the &quot; pos@@ thum@@ ous collaborations &quot; as marking the beginning of &quot; perhaps the most dis@@ reputable phase of Der@@ leth &apos;s activities . &quot; a significant number of H. P. Lov@@ ecraft fans and critics , such as Dir@@ k W. Mo@@ si@@ g , S. T. Jo@@ shi , and Richard L. Ti@@ er@@ ney were dissatisfied with Der@@ leth &apos;s invention of the term &quot; C@@ th@@ ul@@ hu My@@ thos &quot; and his presentation of Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s fiction as having an overall pattern reflecting Der@@ leth &apos;s own Christian world view , which they contrast with Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s depiction of an am@@ oral universe .
however Robert M. Price points out that while Der@@ leth &apos;s tales are distinct from Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s in their use of hope and his depiction of a struggle between good and evil , nevertheless the basis of Der@@ ler@@ th &apos;s system@@ ization are found in Lov@@ ecraft .
he also suggests that the differences can be overstated :
Der@@ leth &quot; was &quot; more optimistic than Lov@@ ecraft in his conception of the My@@ thos , but we are dealing with a difference more of degree than kind .
there are indeed tales wherein Der@@ leth &apos;s protagonists get off sco@@ t @-@ free , but often the hero is doomed , as in Lov@@ ecraft .
and it must be remembered that an occasional Lov@@ ec@@ ra@@ f@@ tian hero does manage to overcome the odds , e.g. , in &quot; The Hor@@ ror in the Museum , &quot; &quot; The Shun@@ ned House , &quot; and &apos; The Case of Charles D@@ ex@@ ter Ward &apos; .
Der@@ leth also treated Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s Old Ones as representatives of elemental forces , creating new fictional entities to flesh out this framework .
such debates aside , Der@@ leth &apos;s founding of Ark@@ ham House and his successful effort to rescue Lov@@ ecraft from literary obscurity are widely acknowledged by practitioners in the horror field as seminal events in the field .
for instance , Ram@@ sey Campbell has acknowledged Der@@ leth &apos;s encouragement and guidance during the early part of his own writing career , and Kir@@ by Mc@@ Ca@@ ul@@ ey has cited Der@@ leth and Ark@@ ham House as an inspiration for his own anth@@ ology , &quot; Dark Forces &quot; .
Ark@@ ham House and Der@@ leth published &quot; Dark Carnival &quot; , the first book by Ray Brad@@ bury , as well .
Brian Lum@@ ley cites the importance of Der@@ leth to his own Lov@@ ec@@ ra@@ f@@ tian work , and contends in a 2009 introduction to Der@@ leth &apos;s work that he was ... &quot; one of the first , finest , and most discerning editors and publishers of mac@@ ab@@ re fiction . &quot; important as was Der@@ leth &apos;s work to rescue H.@@ P. Lov@@ ecraft from literary obscurity at the time of Lov@@ ecraft &apos;s death , Der@@ leth also built a body of horror and spectral fiction of his own ; still frequently anth@@ olog@@ ized .
the best of this work , recently reprinted in four volumes of short stories @-@ most of which were originally published in &quot; We@@ ir@@ d T@@ ales &quot; , illustrates Der@@ leth &apos;s original abilities in the genre .
while Der@@ leth considered his work in this genre less important than his most serious literary efforts , the compilers of these four anth@@ ologies , including Ram@@ sey Campbell , note that the stories still resonate after more than fifty years .
in 2009 , The Library of America selected Der@@ leth &apos;s story &quot; The Pan@@ elled Room &quot; for inclusion in its two @-@ century retrospective of American F@@ ant@@ astic T@@ ales .
</p>
<p>
Der@@ leth also wrote many historical novels , as part of both the &quot; S@@ ac Pra@@ irie S@@ aga &quot; and the &quot; Wisconsin S@@ aga &quot; .
he also wrote history ; arguably most notable among these was &quot; The Wisconsin : River of a Thousand Is@@ les &quot; , published in 1942 .
the work was one in a series entitled &quot; The Rivers of America , &quot; conceived by writer Con@@ stance Lindsay Skin@@ ner in the Great Depression as a series that would connect Americans to their heritage through the history of the great rivers of the nation .
Skin@@ ner wanted the series to be written by artists , not academ@@ icians .
Der@@ leth , while not a trained historian , was , according to former Wisconsin state historian William F. Thompson , ... &quot; a very competent regional historian who based his historical writing upon research in the primary documents and who regularly sought the help of professionals ... . &quot; in the foreword to the 1985 re@@ issue of the work by The University of Wisconsin Press , Thompson concluded :
&quot; no other writer , of whatever background or training , knew and understood his particular &apos; corner of the earth &apos; better than August Der@@ leth . &quot; Der@@ leth wrote several volumes of poems , as well as bi@@ ographies of Z@@ ona G@@ ale , Ralph Wal@@ do Emerson and Henry David Thore@@ au .
he also wrote introductions to several collections of classic early 20th century comics , such as &quot; B@@ uster Brown &quot; , &quot; Little Nem@@ o in S@@ lum@@ ber@@ land &quot; , and &quot; Kat@@ zen@@ jam@@ mer Kids &quot; , as well as a book of children &apos;s poetry entitled &quot; A Boy &apos;s Way &quot; , and the foreword to &quot; T@@ ales from an Indian Lo@@ dge &quot; by &quot; P@@ he@@ be Je@@ well Nichol@@ s . &quot; Der@@ leth also wrote under the n@@ oms de plume Stephen Gr@@ end@@ on , Ken@@ yon Holmes and T@@ ally Mason .
Der@@ leth &apos;s papers and comic book collection were donated to the Wisconsin Historical Society in Madison .

he wrote in his essay &quot; The Re@@ bel &quot; that his whole life was devoted to opposing the philosophy of ni@@ hil@@ ism while still del@@ ving deeply into individual freedom .
he won the Nobel Prize in Literature at the age of 44 in 1957 , the second youngest recipient in history .
Cam@@ us did not consider himself to be an exist@@ enti@@ alist despite usually being classified in that way , even in his lifetime .
in a 1945 interview , Cam@@ us rejected any ideological associations :
&quot; no , I am not an exist@@ enti@@ alist . Sar@@ tre and I are always surprised to see our names linked . &quot; Cam@@ us was born in French Algeria to a &quot; P@@ ied @-@ No@@ ir &quot; family and studied at the University of Algiers , from which he graduated in 1936 .
in 1949 , Cam@@ us founded the Group for International Lia@@ isons to &quot; denounce two ideologies found in both the USSR and the USA . &quot;

Albert Cam@@ us was born on 7 November 19@@ 13 in Mon@@ do@@ vi , in French Algeria .
his mother was of Min@@ or@@ can descent , and could only hear out of her left ear .
his father , Luci@@ en , a poor agricultural worker of Al@@ sati@@ an descent , was wounded in the Battle of the Mar@@ ne in 1914 during World War I , while serving as a member of a Zou@@ ave infantry regiment .
Luci@@ en died from his wounds in a makeshift army hospital on 11 October .
Cam@@ us and his mother , an illiterate house cleaner , lived without many basic material possessions during his childhood in the Bel@@ court section of Algiers .
in 1923 , Cam@@ us gained acceptance into the fr and eventually was admitted to the University of Algiers .
after contracting tuberculosis in 1930 , he had to stop playing football : he had been a goalkeeper for a prominent Algerian university team .
in addition , he was only able to study part @-@ time .
to earn money , he took odd jobs : as a private tutor , car parts clerk , and assistant at the Meteorological Institute .
he completed his &quot; licence de philos@@ op@@ hie &quot; in 1936 ; in May 1936 , he successfully presented his thesis on P@@ lo@@ tin@@ us , &quot; Rap@@ ports de l &apos;@@ hel@@ l@@ én@@ isme et du chris@@ ti@@ anis@@ me à tra@@ vers les oeuv@@ res de P@@ lo@@ tin et de saint Augustin &quot; , for his &quot; fr &quot; .
Cam@@ us joined the French Communist Party in early 1935 , seeing it as a way to &quot; fight inequalities between Europeans and &apos; natives &apos; in Algeria . &quot; he did not suggest he was a Marxist or that he had read &quot; D@@ as Kap@@ ital &quot; , but did write , &quot; We might see communism as a springboard and as@@ ce@@ ticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities . &quot; in 1936 , the independence @-@ minded Algerian Communist Party was founded .
Cam@@ us joined the activities of the Algerian People &apos;s Party , which got him into trouble with his Communist party comrades , who in 1937 denounced him as a T@@ rot@@ sky@@ ite and expelled him from the party .
Cam@@ us then became associated with the French anarch@@ ist movement .
the anarch@@ ist André Prud@@ hom@@ me@@ aux first introduced him at a meeting in 1948 of the &quot; Cer@@ cle des É@@ tu@@ di@@ ants An@@ arch@@ ist@@ es &quot; as a sympath@@ iser familiar with anarch@@ ist thought .
Cam@@ us wrote for anarch@@ ist publications such as &quot; Le Liber@@ taire &quot; , &quot; La ré@@ v@@ olution Pro@@ l@@ é@@ tari@@ enne &quot; , and &quot; Solid@@ ari@@ dad O@@ br@@ era &quot; , the organ of the anarch@@ o @-@ syndic@@ alist CN@@ T .
Cam@@ us stood with the an@@ archi@@ sts when they expressed support for the uprising of 1953 in East Germany .
he again allied with the an@@ archi@@ sts in 1956 , first in support of the workers &apos; uprising in Poz@@ na@@ ń , Poland , and then later with the Hungarian Revolution .
&quot; I do not believe in God and I am not an athe@@ ist . &quot; ~ &quot; Not@@ e@@ books 1951 @-@ 1959 &quot; .
he told &quot; Le Monde &quot; in 1956 , &quot; I would agree with Benjamin Con@@ stant , who thought a lack of religion was vulgar and even hack@@ ne@@ yed . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in 1934 , Cam@@ us married Sim@@ one Hi@@ é , but the marriage ended as a consequence of in@@ fidel@@ ities on both sides .
in 1935 , he founded &quot; Th@@ é@@ â@@ tre du Trav@@ ail &quot; , renamed &quot; Th@@ é@@ â@@ tre de l &apos;@@ Equip@@ e &quot; in 1937 .
it lasted until 1939 .
from 1937 to 1939 he wrote for a socialist paper , &quot; Al@@ ger @-@ Ré@@ public@@ ain &quot; .
his work included a report on the poor conditions for peasants in Kab@@ y@@ lie , which apparently cost him his job .
from 1939 to 1940 , he briefly wrote for a similar paper , &quot; So@@ ir @-@ Republic@@ ain &quot; .
he was rejected by the French army because of his tuberculosis .
in 1940 , Cam@@ us married Franc@@ ine Fa@@ ure , a pianist and mathematician .
although he loved her , he had argued passionately against the institution of marriage , dismissing it as unnatural .
even after Franc@@ ine gave birth to twins , Catherine and Jean , on 5 September 1945 , he continued to joke to friends that he was not cut out for marriage .
Cam@@ us had numerous affairs , particularly an irregular and eventually public affair with the Spanish @-@ born actress María Cas@@ ares , with whom he had an extensive correspondence .
in the same year , Cam@@ us began to work for &quot; Paris @-@ So@@ ir &quot; magazine .
in the first stage of World War II , during the so @-@ called P@@ honey War , Cam@@ us was a pacif@@ ist .
while in Lyon during the We@@ hr@@ mach@@ t occupation , on 15 December 1941 , Cam@@ us read about the Paris execution of Gabriel Pé@@ ri ; it crystallized his revolt against the Germans .
he moved to Bordeaux with the rest of the staff of &quot; Paris @-@ So@@ ir &quot; .
in the same year he finished &quot; The S@@ tran@@ ger &quot; , his first novel , and &quot; The My@@ th of Sis@@ y@@ ph@@ us &quot; .
he returned briefly to Or@@ an , Algeria , in 1942 .
</p>
<p>
Cam@@ us was once asked by his friend Charles Pon@@ c@@ et which he preferred , football or the theatre .
Cam@@ us is said to have replied , &quot; Football , without hesitation . &quot; Cam@@ us played as goalkeeper for Rac@@ ing Universit@@ aire d &apos;@@ Al@@ ger junior team from 1928 to 1930 .
the sense of team spirit , fraternity , and common purpose appealed to Cam@@ us enormously .
in match reports Cam@@ us would often attract positive comment for playing with passion and courage .
any football ambitions disappeared when he contracted tuberculosis at the age of 17 .
the affliction , which was then incurable , caused Cam@@ us to be be@@ dri@@ dden for long and painful periods .
when Cam@@ us was asked in the 1950s by an alum@@ n@@ us sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RU@@ A , his response included the following :
&quot; after many years during which I saw many things , what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport and learned it in the RU@@ A . &quot; Cam@@ us was referring to a sort of simplistic morality he wrote about in his early essays , the principle of sticking up for your friends , of valuing bravery and fair @-@ play .
Cam@@ us &apos;s belief was that political and religious authorities try to confuse us with over @-@ complicated moral systems to make things appear more complex than they really are , potentially to serve their own needs .
a professional footballer appears as a character in &quot; The Pl@@ ague &quot; and football is discussed in the dialogue .
</p>
<p>
as he wrote in &quot; L &apos;@@ Hom@@ me ré@@ vol@@ té &quot; , in the chapter about &quot; The Thought on Mid@@ day , &quot; Cam@@ us was a follower of the ancient Greek &quot; Solar Tra@@ dition &quot; .
in 1947 @-@ 48 , he founded the Revolutionary Union Movement a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndic@@ alism .
according to Olivier Todd , in his biography &quot; Albert Cam@@ us , une vie &quot; , it was a group opposed to some tendencies of the Sur@@ realist movement of André Bret@@ on .
for more , see the book &quot; Alfred Ro@@ sm@@ er et le mou@@ vement ré@@ volu@@ tion@@ n@@ aire international &quot; by Christian Gr@@ as .
his colleagues were Nicolas Lazar@@ é@@ vit@@ ch , Louis Mer@@ ci@@ er , Roger Lap@@ ey@@ re , Paul Cha@@ u@@ vet , Augu@@ ste Lar@@ gen@@ tier , and Jean de Bo@@ ë .
his main aim was to express the positive side of sur@@ realism and exist@@ enti@@ alism , rejecting the negativity and the ni@@ hil@@ ism of André Bret@@ on .
from 1943 , Albert Cam@@ us had correspondence with Al@@ ti@@ ero Spin@@ elli , who founded the European Feder@@ alist Movement in Milan .
in 1944 , Cam@@ us founded the &quot; French Committee for the European Federation &quot; declaring that Europe &quot; can only evolve along the path of economic progress , democracy , and peace if the nation states become a federation . &quot; from 22 to 25 March 1945 , the first conference of the European Feder@@ alist Movement was organised in Paris with the participation of Albert Cam@@ us , George Or@@ well , Emmanuel Moun@@ ier , Lewis Mum@@ ford , André Philip , Daniel May@@ er , François Bon@@ dy , and Al@@ ti@@ ero Spin@@ elli .
this specific branch of the European Feder@@ alist Movement disintegrated in 1957 after Winston Churchill &apos;s ideas about European integration rose to dominance .

Cam@@ us died on 4 January 1960 at the age of 46 , in a car accident near S@@ ens , in Le Grand F@@ oss@@ ard in the small town of Ville@@ bl@@ evin .
in his coat pocket was an unused train ticket .
he had planned to travel by train with his wife and children , but at the last minute he accepted his publisher &apos;s proposal to travel with him .
the driver of the Fac@@ el Vega HK@@ 500 car , fr , who was Cam@@ us &apos; publisher and close friend , died five days after the accident .
in August 2011 , the Milan newspaper &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ ere della Ser@@ a &quot; reported a theory that the writer had been the victim of a Soviet plot , but Cam@@ us &apos; bi@@ ographer , fr , did not consider it credible .
Cam@@ us was buried in the Lour@@ mar@@ in Cemetery , Lour@@ mar@@ in , V@@ au@@ cl@@ use , France .
he was the second @-@ youngest recipient , at the age of 44 , of the Nobel Prize in Literature , after Rud@@ yard Ki@@ pling , who was 42 .
he was survived by his wife and twin son and daughter , Jean and Catherine , who hold the copyrights to his work .
two of Cam@@ us &apos; works were published pos@@ thum@@ ously .
the first , entitled &quot; A Happy Death &quot; , featured a character named Pat@@ rice Mer@@ sa@@ ult , comparable to &quot; The S@@ tran@@ ger &quot; &apos; s Me@@ ur@@ sa@@ ult .
there is scholarly debate as to the relationship between the two books .
the second was an unfinished novel , &quot; The First Man &quot; , which Cam@@ us was writing before he died .
the novel was an autobi@@ ographical work about his childhood in Algeria .
</p>
<p>
the first publication of Cam@@ us was &quot; Rev@@ ol@@ te dans les A@@ stu@@ ries &quot; in May 1936 .
this concerned a revolt by Spanish miners that was brutally suppressed by the Spanish government .
in May 1937 he wrote his first book , &quot; L &apos;@@ En@@ vers et l &apos;@@ En@@ droit &quot; - dedicated to Jean Gren@@ ier and also edited by Char@@ lot .
during World War II Cam@@ us joined the French Resistance cell &quot; Combat &quot; , which published an underground newspaper of the same name .
this group worked against the Nazis , and in it Cam@@ us assumed the &quot; n@@ om de guer@@ re &quot; &quot; Beau@@ chard &quot; .
Cam@@ us became the paper &apos;s editor in 1943 .
he first met Sar@@ tre at the dress rehearsal of Sar@@ tre &apos;s play , &quot; The F@@ lies &quot; , in June 1943 .
when the Allies liberated Paris in August 1944 , Cam@@ us witnessed and reported the last of the fighting .
soon after the event on 6 August 1945 , he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States &apos; dropping the atomic bombs on Japan .
he resigned from &quot; Combat &quot; in 1947 when it became a commercial paper .
after the war , Cam@@ us began frequ@@ enting the Café de Flor@@ e on the Boulevard Saint @-@ Ger@@ main in Paris with Sar@@ tre and others .
he also toured the United States to lecture about French thought .
although he leaned left , politically , his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sar@@ tre .
in 1949 , his tuberculosis returned , whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years .
in 1951 , he published &quot; The Re@@ bel &quot; , a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism .
upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France , the book brought about the final split with Sar@@ tre .
the d@@ our reception depressed Cam@@ us ; he began to translate plays .
Cam@@ us &apos;s first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd .
he saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither , which he expressed in &quot; The My@@ th of Sis@@ y@@ ph@@ us &quot; and incorporated into many of his other works , such as &quot; The S@@ tran@@ ger &quot; and &quot; The Pl@@ ague &quot; .
despite his split from his &quot; study partner &quot; Sar@@ tre , Cam@@ us was still categorized as an Ex@@ ist@@ enti@@ alist .
he specifically rejected that label in his essay &quot; En@@ ig@@ ma &quot; and elsewhere .
the current confusion arises , in part , because many recent applications of exist@@ enti@@ alism have much in common with many of Cam@@ us &apos;s &quot; practical &quot; ideas .
but his personal understanding of the world , and every vision he had for its progress undoubtedly set him apart .
in the 1950s , Cam@@ us devoted his efforts to human rights .
in 1952 , he resigned from his work for UNESCO when the UN accepted Spain as a member under the leadership of General Franco .
in 1953 , he criticized Soviet methods to crush a workers &apos; strike in East Berlin .
in 1956 , he protested against similar methods in Poland and the Soviet repression of the Hungarian revolution in October .
Cam@@ us maintained his pacif@@ ism and resisted capital punishment anywhere in the world .
he wrote an essay against capital punishment in collaboration with Arthur Ko@@ est@@ ler , the writer , intellectual , and founder of the League Against Capital Punishment .
he was consistent in his call for non @-@ aggression in Algeria .
from 1955 to 1956 , Cam@@ us wrote for &quot; L &apos;@@ Express &quot; .
in 1957 , he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature &quot; for his important literary production , which with clear @-@ sighted earne@@ st@@ ness illumin@@ ates the problems of the human conscience in our times . &quot; Cam@@ us remained active and ambitious until the end of his life .
financed by the money he received with his Nobel Prize , he adapted and directed for the stage Do@@ sto@@ y@@ es@@ vsky &apos;s Dem@@ ons .
the play opened in January 1959 at the Antoine Theatre in Paris .
it was a critical success as well as an artistic and technical tour de force : 33 actors , 4 hours long , 7 sets , 24 scenes .
the walls could move sideways to reduce the size of each depicted location and the whole stage rotated to allow for immediate set transformations .
Cam@@ us put the painter and set decor@@ ator Mayo , who had already illustrated several of Cam@@ us &apos; novels , in charge of the demanding task of designing these multiple and complex theater sets .
</p>
<p>
Cam@@ us once confi@@ ded that the troubles in Algeria &quot; affected him as others feel pain in their lungs . &quot; in the 1930s , Cam@@ us was affiliated with Left @-@ wing groups like the &quot; Ma@@ ison de Culture &quot; in Algiers which were highly critical of the French colonial regime &apos;s treatment of Algeria &apos;s Arab and indigenous inhabitants , supporting the Bl@@ um @-@ Viol@@ lette proposal to grant Alg@@ erians full French citizenship .
his 1938 address on &quot; The New Mediterranean Culture &quot; represents Cam@@ us &apos; most systematic statement on his views at this time .
in 1939 , Cam@@ us wrote a stinging series of articles for &quot; Al@@ ger Republic@@ ain &quot; on the atrocious living conditions of the inhabitants of the Kab@@ y@@ lie highlands , advocating for economic , educational and political reforms as a matter of emergency .
in 1945 , following the Sé@@ tif and Guel@@ ma massacre after Arab revol@@ ts against French mistreatment , Cam@@ us was one of only a few mainland journalists to visit the colony , again writing a series of article reports on conditions , and advocating for French reforms and concessions to the demands of the Algerian people .
when the Algerian War began in 1954 , Cam@@ us was confronted with a moral dilemma .
he identified with the &quot; Pi@@ eds @-@ No@@ irs &quot; such as his own parents and defended the French government &apos;s actions against the revolt .
he argued that the Algerian uprising was an integral part of the &apos; new Arab imperialism &apos; led by Egypt and an &apos; anti @-@ Western &apos; offensive orchestrated by Russia to &apos; encir@@ cle Europe &apos; and &apos; isolate the United States &apos; .
although fav@@ oring greater Algerian autonomy or even federation , though not full @-@ scale independence , he believed that the &quot; Pi@@ eds @-@ No@@ irs &quot; and Arabs could co @-@ exist .
during the war he advocated a civil truce that would spare the civilians , which was rejected by both sides , who regarded it as foolish .
behind the scenes , he began to work for imprisoned Alg@@ erians who faced the death penalty .
when he spoke to students at the University of Stockholm , he defended his apparent inactivity in the Algerian question ; he stated that he was worried about what might happen to his mother , who still lived in Algeria .
this led to further ostrac@@ ism by French left @-@ wing intellectuals .
at the time of his death , Cam@@ us was working on an incomplete novel with a strong biographical component titled &quot; The First Man . &quot; the publication of this book in 1994 has sparked a widespread reconsideration of Cam@@ us &apos; allegedly un@@ repent@@ ant colonialism in the work of figures such as David Car@@ roll in the English @-@ speaking world .
</p>
<p>
as one of the fathers of exist@@ enti@@ alism , Cam@@ us focused most of his philosophy around existential questions .
the absurdity of life and its inevitable ending is highlighted in the very famous opening of the novel &quot; The S@@ tran@@ ger &quot; : &quot; today mother died . or maybe yesterday ;
I can &apos;t be sure . &quot; this all@@ udes to his claim that life is eng@@ rossed by the absurd .
he believed that the absurd - life being void of meaning , or man &apos;s inability to know that meaning if it were to exist - was something that man should embrace .
he argued that this crisis of self could cause a man to commit &quot; philosophical suicide &quot; ; choosing to believe in external sources that give life false meaning .
he argued that religion was the main culprit .
if a man chose to believe in religion - that the meaning of life was to ascend to heaven , or some similar afterlife , that he committed philosophical suicide by trying to escape the absurd .
</p>
<p>
many writers have addressed the Ab@@ sur@@ d , each with his or her own interpretation of what the Ab@@ sur@@ d is and what comprises its importance .
for example , Sar@@ tre recognizes the absurdity of individual experience , while Ki@@ er@@ k@@ eg@@ a@@ ard explains that the absurdity of certain religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally .
Cam@@ us regretted the continued reference to himself as a &quot; philosopher of the absurd . &quot; he showed less interest in the Ab@@ sur@@ d shortly after publishing &quot; Le My@@ the de Sis@@ yp@@ he &quot; .
</p>
<p>
Cam@@ us presents the reader with du@@ al@@ isms such as happiness and sadness , dark and light , life and death , etc .
he emphasizes the fact that happiness is fleeting and that the human condition is one of mortality ; for Cam@@ us , this is cause for a greater appreciation for life and happiness .
in &quot; Le My@@ the &quot; , du@@ alism becomes a paradox : we value our own lives in spite of our mortality and in spite of the universe &apos;s silence .
while we can live with a du@@ alism , we cannot live with the paradox .
in &quot; Le My@@ the &quot; , Cam@@ us investigates our experience of the Ab@@ sur@@ d and asks how we live with it .
our life must have meaning for us to value it .
if we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value , should we kill ourselves ?
in &quot; Le My@@ the &quot; , Cam@@ us suggests that &quot; creation of meaning &quot; would entail a logical leap or a kind of philosophical suicide in order to find psychological comfort .
but Cam@@ us wants to know if he can live with what logic and lu@@ cid@@ ity have uncovered - if one can build a foundation on what one knows and nothing more .
creation of meaning is not a viable alternative but a logical leap and an evasion of the problem .
he gives examples of how others would seem to make this kind of leap .
the alternative option , namely suicide , would entail another kind of leap , where one attempts to kill absurdity by destroying one of its terms .
Cam@@ us points out , however , that there is no more meaning in death than there is in life , and that it simply ev@@ ades the problem yet again .
Cam@@ us concludes that we must instead &quot; entertain &quot; both death and the absurd , while never agreeing to their terms .
Me@@ ur@@ sa@@ ult , the absur@@ dist hero of &quot; L &apos;É@@ tran@@ ger , &quot; has killed a man and is scheduled to be executed .
Cal@@ ig@@ ula ends up admitting his absurd logic was wrong and is killed by an assassination he has deliberately brought about .
however , while Cam@@ us possibly suggests that Cal@@ ig@@ ula &apos;s absurd reasoning is wrong , the play &apos;s anti @-@ hero does get the last word , as the author similarly exal@@ ts Me@@ ur@@ sa@@ ult &apos;s final moments .
Cam@@ us made a significant contribution to a viewpoint of the Ab@@ sur@@ d , and always rejected ni@@ hil@@ ism as a valid response .
if nothing had any meaning , you would be right .
but there is something that still has a meaning . - &quot; Second Letter to a German Friend &quot; , December 1943 .
Cam@@ us &apos;s understanding of the Ab@@ sur@@ d promotes debate ; his offerings entice us to think about the Ab@@ sur@@ d and offer our own contribution .
concepts such as cooperation , joint effort , and solidarity are of key importance to Cam@@ us , though they are most likely sources of &quot; relative &quot; versus &quot; absolute &quot; meaning .
in &quot; The Re@@ bel , &quot; Cam@@ us identifies rebellion as a basis for human solidarity .
when he rebels , a man identifies himself with other men and so surpasses himself , and from this point of view human solidarity is metaphysical .
but for the moment we are only talking of the kind of solidarity that is born in chains .
</p>
<p>
despite his opposition to the exist@@ enti@@ alist label , Cam@@ us addressed one of the fundamental questions of exist@@ enti@@ alism : the problem of suicide .
he wrote , &quot; There is only one really serious philosophical question , and that is suicide . deciding whether or not life is worth living is to answer the fundamental question in philosophy . all other questions follow from that . &quot; Cam@@ us viewed the question of suicide as arising naturally as a solution to the absurdity of life .
in &quot; The My@@ th of Sis@@ y@@ ph@@ us &quot; , Cam@@ us seeks to identify the kinds of life that could be worth living despite their inherent meaning@@ lessness .
</p>
<p>
throughout his life , Cam@@ us spoke out against and actively opposed tot@@ alitarianism in its many forms .
Cam@@ us was active in the French Resistance to the German occupation of France during World War II , directing the famous Resistance journal &quot; Combat &quot; .
on the French collaboration with Nazi occupiers he wrote :
&quot; now the only moral value is courage , which is useful here for judging the pup@@ pets and ch@@ atter@@ boxes who pretend to speak in the name of the people . &quot; after liberation , Cam@@ us remarked , &quot; This country does not need a Tal@@ ley@@ rand , but a Saint @-@ Just . &quot; the reality of the bloody postwar tribunals soon changed his mind :
Cam@@ us publicly reversed himself and became a lifelong opponent of capital punishment .
Cam@@ us &apos;s falling out with Sar@@ tre is linked to Cam@@ us &apos;s opposition to authoritarian communism .
Cam@@ us detected a reflexi@@ ve tot@@ alitarianism in the mass politics espoused by Sar@@ tre in the name of Marxism .
this was apparent in Cam@@ us &apos;s work &quot; L &apos;@@ Hom@@ me Ré@@ vol@@ té &quot; which not only was an assault on the Soviet police state , but also questioned the very nature of mass revolutionary politics and ideas .
Cam@@ us continued to speak out against the atrocities of the Soviet Union , a sentiment captured in his 1957 speech &quot; The Blood of the Hung@@ arians &quot; , commemorating the anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution , an uprising crushed in a bloody assault by the Red Army .
</p>
<p>
one further important , often neglected component of Cam@@ us &apos; philosophical and literary persona was his love of classical Greek thought and literature , or phil@@ hel@@ len@@ ism .
this love looks back to his youthful encounters with Friedrich Nietzsche , his teacher Jean Gren@@ ier , and his own sense of a &quot; Mediterranean &quot; identity , based in a common experience of sunshine , beaches , and living in proximity to the near @-@ Eastern world .
Cam@@ us &apos; &quot; Diplom@@ es &quot; thesis was on the transition between the classical Greek / Roman , and Christian cultures , featuring chapters on the early Church , g@@ no@@ stic@@ ism , P@@ lo@@ tin@@ us , and Saint Augustine &apos;s &quot; second revelation , &quot; bringing Greek philosophical conceptu@@ ality to Christian revelation .
Cam@@ us &apos; early essay collection &quot; N@@ oc@@ es &quot; features essays set amidst classical Roman ruins ; as the &quot; My@@ th of Sis@@ y@@ ph@@ us &quot; and &quot; The Re@@ bel &quot; are each rooted in Cam@@ us &apos; classical &quot; pa@@ ide@@ ia &quot; .
the culmination of the latter work defends a &quot; midday thought &quot; based in classical moderation or &quot; me@@ sure &quot; , in opposition to the tendency of modern political ideologies to exclusively valor@@ ise race or class , and to dream of a total redem@@ ptive revolution .
Cam@@ us &apos; conception of classical moderation also has deep roots in his lifelong love of Greek tragic theatre , about which he gave an intriguing address in Athens in 1956 .
Cam@@ us appealed to Queen Elizabeth II for mercy for the young Greek anti @-@ colonial freedom fighter Mic@@ hal@@ is Kar@@ a@@ olis , from Ky@@ pros , who was sentenced to death in 1956 .
Cam@@ us &apos;s letter was acquired at auction by Nas@@ os K@@ tor@@ ides and donated to the National Stru@@ ggle Museum in Nicosia .

Aga@@ tha Mary Clar@@ issa Miller was born on 15 September 1890 into a wealthy upper @-@ middle @-@ class family in Tor@@ qu@@ ay , Dev@@ on .
she was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alv@@ ah Miller , an affluent American stock@@ broker , and his British @-@ born wife Clara Miller n@@ ée Bo@@ eh@@ mer .
Aga@@ tha &apos;s mother Clara had been born in Belfast in 18@@ 54 to Captain Frederick Bo@@ eh@@ mer and Mary Ann West as the couple &apos;s only daughter .
Bo@@ eh@@ mer was killed in a riding accident while stationed on Jersey in April 1863 , leaving his widow to raise the children alone on a meagre income .
in that same year , 1863 , Mary Ann &apos;s sister Margaret married a wealthy American , Na@@ than@@ iel Fr@@ ary Miller , and the couple settled in South@@ bourne , West Sus@@ sex .
their marriage was childless , but Na@@ than@@ iel had a son , Frederick , from a previous marriage .
Frederick had been sent to Switzerland for his education .
since Mary Ann was virtually pen@@ nil@@ ess and her sister Margaret was wealthy but childless , they arranged that Clara should be raised by her aunt and uncle .
it was at the Miller &apos;s residence that Clara met Frederick , her maternal aunt &apos;s step @-@ son .
she and Frederick soon developed a romantic relationship and were married in April 18@@ 78 .
the couple &apos;s first child , Margaret Fr@@ ary Miller , was born in Tor@@ qu@@ ay , where the couple were renting lod@@ gings .
their second child , Louis Mon@@ tant , was born in the U.S. state of New York , while Frederick was on a business trip .
when Frederick &apos;s father Na@@ than@@ iel died , he left his daughter @-@ in @-@ law Clara £ 2000 ; she used this money to purchase a villa in Tor@@ qu@@ ay named &quot; Ash@@ field &quot; in which to raise her family .
it was here that her third and final child , Aga@@ tha , was born .
Christie described her childhood as &quot; very happy . &quot; she was surrounded by a series of strong and independent women from an early age .
her time was spent alternating between her home in Dev@@ on , her step @-@ grandmother and aunt &apos;s house in E@@ aling , West London , and parts of Southern Europe , where her family would holiday during the winter .
Aga@@ tha was raised in a household with various esoteric beliefs and , like her siblings , believed that her mother Clara was a psychic with the ability of second sight .
Aga@@ tha &apos;s sister Margaret had been sent to Ro@@ e@@ dean in Sus@@ sex for her education , but their mother insisted that Aga@@ tha receive a home education .
as a result , her parents were responsible for teaching her to read and write and to master basic arithmetic , a subject she particularly enjoyed .
they also taught her music , and she learned to play both the piano and the man@@ dol@@ in .
according to bi@@ ographer Laura Thomson , Clara believed that Aga@@ tha should not learn to read until she was eight .
however , thanks to her own curiosity , Aga@@ tha taught herself to read much earlier .
one of the earliest known photographs of Christie depicts her as a little girl with her first dog , whom she called George Washington .
Christie was a voracious reader from an early age .
among her earliest memories were those of reading the children &apos;s books written by Mrs M@@ oles@@ worth , including &quot; The Ad@@ ventures of H@@ err Baby &quot; , &quot; Christmas Tree Land &quot; , and &quot; The Magic Nu@@ ts &quot; .
she also read the work of Edith N@@ es@@ bit , including &quot; The Story of the Tre@@ asure Seekers &quot; , &quot; The Phoenix and the Car@@ pet &quot; , and &quot; The Railway Children &quot; .
when a little older , she moved on to reading the surreal verse of Edward L@@ ear and Lewis Car@@ roll .
in April 1901 , at age 10 , she wrote her first poem , &quot; The cow@@ slip . &quot; she spent much of her childhood apart from other children , although she devoted much time to her pets .
she eventually made friends with a group of other girls in Tor@@ qu@@ ay , noting that &quot; one of the highlights of my existence &quot; was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan &apos;s &quot; The Ye@@ omen of the Guard &quot; , in which she played the hero , Colonel Fair@@ fax .
this was her last oper@@ atic role for , as she later wrote , &quot; an experience that you really enjoyed should never be repeated . &quot; her father was often ill , suffering from a series of heart attacks .
his death in November 1901 , aged 55 , left the family in an uncertain economic situation .
Clara and Aga@@ tha continued to live together in their Tor@@ qu@@ ay home , Mad@@ ge had moved to Ab@@ ney Hall in C@@ head@@ le , Ches@@ hire , with her new husband , and Mon@@ ty had joined the army and been sent to South Africa to fight in the Bo@@ er War .
Aga@@ tha later claimed that her father &apos;s death , occurring when she was 11 years old , marked the end of her childhood .
in 19@@ 02 , she was sent to receive a formal education at Miss Gu@@ yer &apos;s Girls School in Tor@@ qu@@ ay but found it difficult to adjust to the disciplined atmosphere .
in 1905 , she was sent to Paris where she was educated in three &quot; pensions &quot; - Mademoiselle Cab@@ er@@ net &apos;s , Les Mar@@ ron@@ iers , and then Miss Dry@@ den &apos;s - the last of which served primarily as a finishing school .

Christie returned to England in 1910 to find that her mother Clara was ill .
they decided to spend time together in the warmer climate of Cairo , then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons ; they stayed for three months at the Ge@@ zi@@ rah Palace Hotel .
Christie attended many social functions in search of a husband .
she visited ancient Egyptian monuments such as the Great Pyramid of G@@ iza , but did not exhibit the great interest in archaeology and Egyp@@ t@@ ology that became prominent in her later years .
returning to Britain , she continued her social activities , writing and performing in amateur theat@@ ric@@ als .
she also helped put on a play called &quot; The Blu@@ e@@ Beard of Un@@ happiness &quot; with female friends .
her writing extended to both poetry and music .
some early works saw publication , but she decided against focusing on writing or music as future professions .
Christie wrote her first short story , &quot; The House of Beauty &quot; while recovering in bed from an undisclosed illness .
this was about 6,000 words on the topic of &quot; madness and dreams , &quot; a subject of fascination for her .
bi@@ ographer Janet Morgan commented that , despite &quot; inf@@ el@@ icities of style , &quot; the story was nevertheless &quot; compelling . &quot; other stories followed , most of them illustrating her interest in spiritu@@ alism and the par@@ an@@ orm@@ al .
these included &quot; The Call of W@@ ings &quot; and &quot; The Little Lon@@ ely God . &quot; magazines rejected all her early submissions , made under pseud@@ onyms , although some were revised and published later , often with new titles .
Christie then set her first novel , &quot; Snow Upon the Desert &quot; , in Cairo and drew from her recent experiences in that city , writing under the pseud@@ onym Mono@@ syllab@@ a .
she was perturbed when the various publishers she contacted all declined .
Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from a family friend and neighbour , the writer Eden Phil@@ pot@@ ts , who obliged her enquiry , encouraged her writing , and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent , Hughes Massi@@ e , who rejected &quot; Snow Upon the Desert &quot; and suggested a second novel .
she continued searching for a husband , and entered into short @-@ lived relationships with four separate men and an engagement with another .
she then met Archi@@ bald Christie at a dance given by Lord and Lady Clifford at U@@ g@@ brooke , about from Tor@@ qu@@ ay .
Archi@@ e was born in India , the son of a barrister in the Indian Civil Service .
he was an army officer who was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in April 19@@ 13 .
the couple quickly fell in love .
upon learning that he would be stationed in Far@@ n@@ borough , Archi@@ e proposed marriage , and Aga@@ tha accepted .
with the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Archi@@ e was sent to France to fight the German forces .
they married on the afternoon of Christmas Eve 1914 at Emmanuel Church , Clif@@ ton , Bristol , which was close to the home of his parents , while Archi@@ e was on home leave .
rising through the ranks , he was eventually stationed back to Britain in September 1918 as a colonel in the Air Ministry .
Aga@@ tha involved herself in the war effort .
after joining the Voluntary Aid Det@@ achment in 1914 , she attended to wounded soldiers at a hospital in Tor@@ qu@@ ay as an unpaid nurse .
responsible for aiding the doctors and maintaining morale , she performed 3,400 hours of unpaid work between October 1914 and December 1916 .
on qualifying as an &quot; apo@@ thec@@ aries &apos; assistant &quot; in 1917 and working as a dispenser , she earned £ 16 a year until the end of her service in September 1918 .
after the war , Aga@@ tha and Archi@@ e Christie settled in a flat at 5 North@@ wick Ter@@ race in St. John &apos;s Wood , northwest London .

Christie had long been a fan of detective novels , having enjoyed Wil@@ kie Collins &apos;s &quot; The Woman in White &quot; and &quot; The Mo@@ on@@ stone &quot; , as well as Sir Arthur Con@@ an Doyle &apos;s early Sher@@ lock Holmes stories .
she wrote her own detective novel , &quot; The My@@ ster@@ ious Aff@@ air at St@@ yles &quot; , featuring Hercul@@ e Po@@ i@@ rot , a former Belgian police officer noted for his twir@@ ly large &quot; magnificent mou@@ st@@ aches &quot; and egg @-@ shaped head .
Po@@ i@@ rot had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium .
Christie &apos;s inspiration for the character stemmed from real Belgian refugees who were living in Tor@@ qu@@ ay and the Belgian soldiers whom she helped to treat as a volunteer nurse in Tor@@ qu@@ ay during the First World War .
she began working on &quot; The My@@ ster@@ ious Aff@@ air at St@@ yles &quot; in 1916 , writing most of it on Dar@@ t@@ moor .
her original manuscript was rejected by such publishing companies as Hod@@ der and St@@ ough@@ ton and Me@@ thu@@ en .
after keeping the submission for several months , John Lane at The Bod@@ ley Head offered to accept it , provided that Christie change the ending .
she did so , and signed a contract which she later felt was exploitative .
it was finally published in 1920 .
Christie , meanwhile , settled into married life , giving birth to her only child , Ro@@ sal@@ ind Margaret H@@ icks , in August 1919 at Ash@@ field , where the couple spent much of their time , having few friends in London .
Archi@@ e left the Air Force at the end of the war and started working in the City financial sector at a relatively low salary , though they still employed a maid .
her second novel , &quot; The Secret Ad@@ versary &quot; , featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tup@@ pence , again published by The Bod@@ ley Head .
it earned her £ 50 .
a third novel again featured Po@@ i@@ rot , &quot; Mur@@ der on the Links &quot; , as did short stories commissioned by Bruce In@@ gram , editor of &quot; The S@@ ket@@ ch &quot; magazine .
in order to tour the world promoting the British Empire Exhibition , the couple left their daughter Ro@@ sal@@ ind with Aga@@ tha &apos;s mother and sister .
they travelled to South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , and Hawaii .
they learned to surf prone in South Africa ; then , in Wai@@ k@@ iki , they were among the first Britons to surf standing up .

in late 1926 , Archi@@ e asked Aga@@ tha for a divorce .
he had fallen in love with Nancy Ne@@ ele , who had been a friend of Major Bel@@ cher , director of the British Empire Mission , on the promotional tour a few years earlier .
on 3 December 1926 , the Chris@@ ties quarrel@@ led , and Archi@@ e left their house , which they named St@@ yles , in Sun@@ ning@@ dale , Berkshire , to spend the weekend with his mistress in Go@@ dal@@ ming , Surrey .
that same evening , around 9 : 45 pm , Christie disappeared from her home , leaving behind a letter for her secretary saying that she was going to Yorkshire .
her car , a Morris Cow@@ ley , was later found at New@@ lands Corner , perched above a chalk quarry , with an expired driving licence and clothes .
her disappearance caused an outcry from the public .
the Home Secretary , William Jo@@ yn@@ son @-@ H@@ icks , pressured police , and a newspaper offered a £ 100 reward .
over a thousand police officers , 15,000 volunteers , and several aero@@ planes sc@@ oured the rural landscape .
Sir Arthur Con@@ an Doyle even gave a spirit medium one of Christie &apos;s gloves to find the missing woman .
Dorothy L. Say@@ ers visited the house in Surrey , later using the scenario in her book &quot; Un@@ natural Death &quot; .
Christie &apos;s disappearance was featured on the front page of &quot; The New York Times &quot; .
despite the extensive man@@ hunt , she was not found for 10 days .
on 14 December 1926 , she was found at the Swan Hydro@@ path@@ ic Hotel in Har@@ rogate , Yorkshire , registered as Mrs Teresa Ne@@ ele from Cape Town .
Christie &apos;s autobiography makes no reference to her disappearance .
two doctors diagnosed her as suffering from amnesia , yet opinion remains divided as to why she disappeared .
her bi@@ ographer Laura Thompson suggested that Christie let this out in the six novels that she wrote between 1930 and 1956 under the n@@ om de plume Mary West@@ mac@@ ott , in a style quite different from her regular detective stories .
she was known to be in a depressed state from literary overwork , her mother &apos;s death earlier that year , and her husband &apos;s infidelity .
public reaction at the time was largely negative , supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder .
the 1979 Michael Ap@@ ted film &quot; Aga@@ tha &quot; features a disclaimer in the opening credits stating that what follows is an imaginary solution to an authentic mystery .
the film star@@ red Vanessa Red@@ grave and Timothy Dal@@ ton as Aga@@ tha and Archi@@ e , and depicts Christie planning suicide in such a way as to frame her husband &apos;s mistress for her &quot; murder . &quot; an American reporter , played by D@@ ustin Hoffman , follows her closely and stops the plan .
Christie &apos;s heirs unsuccessfully sued to prevent the film &apos;s distribution .
the author J@@ ared C@@ ade interviewed numerous witnesses and relatives for his sympathetic biography &quot; Aga@@ tha Christie and the Eleven Missing Days &quot; , revised in 2011 .
he provided substantial evidence to suggest that she planned the event to embarrass her husband , never anticipating the resulting escalated melo@@ drama .
the Chris@@ ties divorced in 1928 , and Archi@@ e married Nancy Ne@@ ele .
Aga@@ tha retained custody of their daughter Ro@@ sal@@ ind and the Christie name for her writing .
during their marriage , she published six novels , a collection of short stories , and a number of short stories in magazines .

in 1928 , Christie left England for Istanbul and subsequently for Baghdad on the Orient Express .
late in this trip , in 1930 , she met a young archae@@ ologist 13 years her junior , Max M@@ allow@@ an , whom she married in September 1930 .
their marriage was happy and lasted until Christie &apos;s death in 1976 .
in a 1977 interview , M@@ allow@@ an recounted his first meeting with Christie , when he took her and a group of tourists on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq .
Christie frequently used settings that were familiar to her for her stories .
she often accompanied M@@ allow@@ an on his archaeological expeditions , and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East .
other novels were set in and around Tor@@ qu@@ ay , where she was raised .
Christie &apos;s 1934 novel &quot; Mur@@ der on the Orient Express &quot; was written in the Per@@ a Palace Hotel in Istanbul , Turkey , the southern terminus of the railway .
the hotel maintains Christie &apos;s room as a memorial to the author .
the Green@@ way Estate in Dev@@ on , acquired by the couple as a summer residence in 1938 , is now in the care of the National Trust .
Christie often stayed at Ab@@ ney Hall , Ches@@ hire , owned by her brother @-@ in @-@ law , James Watts , basing at least two stories there : a short story &quot; The Ad@@ venture of the Christmas Pud@@ ding &quot; in the story collection of the same name , and the novel &quot; After the Fun@@ eral &quot; .
&quot; Ab@@ ney became Aga@@ tha &apos;s greatest inspiration for country @-@ house life , with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots . the descriptions of the fictional Chim@@ neys , St@@ on@@ ey@@ gates , and other houses in her stories are mostly Ab@@ ney in various forms . &quot; during the Second World War , Christie worked in the pharmacy at University College Hospital , London , where she acquired a knowledge of poisons that she put to good use in her post @-@ war crime novels .
for example , the use of th@@ alli@@ um as a poison was suggested to her by UC@@ H Chief Pharmac@@ ist Harold Davis , and in &quot; The P@@ ale Horse &quot; , published in 1961 , she employed it to dispatch a series of victims , the first clue to the murder method coming from the victims &apos; loss of hair .
so accurate was her description of th@@ alli@@ um poisoning that on at least one occasion it helped solve a case that was ba@@ ffling doctors .
Christie lived in Chelsea , first in C@@ res@@ swell Place and later in She@@ ff@@ i@@ eld Ter@@ race .
both properties are now marked by blue pla@@ ques .
in 1934 , she and Max M@@ allow@@ an purchased W@@ inter@@ brook House in W@@ inter@@ brook , a ham@@ let adjoining the small market town of Wall@@ ing@@ ford , then within the bounds of Ch@@ ol@@ sey and in Berkshire .
this was their main residence for the rest of their lives and the place where Christie did most of her writing .
this house , too , bears a blue plaque .
Christie led a quiet life despite being known in the town of Wall@@ ing@@ ford , where she was for many years President of the local amateur dramatic society .
around 1941 @-@ 42 , the British intelligence agency MI@@ 5 investigated Christie after a character called Major B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley appeared in her 1941 thriller &quot; N or M ? &quot; , which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth column@@ ists in wartime England .
MI@@ 5 was afraid that Christie had a spy in Britain &apos;s top @-@ secret co@@ deb@@ re@@ aking centre , B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park .
the agency &apos;s fears were al@@ la@@ yed when Christie told her friend , the co@@ deb@@ re@@ aker Dil@@ ly Kno@@ x , &quot; I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters . &quot; in honour of her many literary works , she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1956 New Year Hon@@ ours .
the next year , she became the President of the Detection Club .
in the 1971 New Year Hon@@ ours , she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire , three years after her husband had been kn@@ ighted for his archaeological work in 1968 .
they were one of the few married couples where both partners were honoured in their own right .
from 1968 , owing to her husband &apos;s kn@@ igh@@ thood , Christie could also be styled Lady M@@ allow@@ an .
from 1971 to 1974 , Christie &apos;s health began to fail , although she continued to write .
recently , using experimental tools of textual analysis , Canadian researchers have suggested that Christie may have begun to suffer from Alzheimer &apos;s disease or other dementia .

Dame Aga@@ tha Christie died on 12 January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her home W@@ inter@@ brook House which was located in W@@ inter@@ brook , Wall@@ ing@@ ford , Ox@@ ford@@ shire .
at the time of her death W@@ inter@@ brook was still a part of the parish of Ch@@ ol@@ sey .
she is buried in the nearby church@@ yard of St Mary &apos;s , Ch@@ ol@@ sey , having chosen the plot for their final resting place with her husband Sir Max some ten years before she died .
the simple funeral service was attended by about 20 newspaper and TV reporters , some having travelled from as far away as South America .
thirty wre@@ aths adorned Dame Aga@@ tha &apos;s grave , including one from the cast of her long @-@ running play &quot; The Mou@@ se@@ trap &quot; and one sent &apos; on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers &apos; by the Ul@@ vers@@ cro@@ ft Large Print Book Publishers .
she was survived by her only child , Ro@@ sal@@ ind H@@ icks , and only grandson , Ma@@ the@@ w Pric@@ hard .
her husband , Max , died in 1978 , aged 74 , after having re@@ married in 1977 .
he was inter@@ red next to Aga@@ tha Christie .

Christie had set up a private company , Aga@@ tha Christie Limited , to hold the rights to her works , and around 1959 she had transferred her 278 @-@ acre home , Green@@ way Estate , to her daughter Ro@@ sal@@ ind .
in 1968 , when Christie was almost 80 years old , she sold a 51 % stake in Aga@@ tha Christie Limited to Boo@@ ker Books , a subsidiary of the food and transport conglomerate Boo@@ ker @-@ Mc@@ Conn@@ ell , the founder of the Boo@@ ker Prize for literature , which later increased its stake to 64 % .
Aga@@ tha Christie Limited remains the owner of the worldwide rights for over 80 of Christie &apos;s novels and short stories , 19 plays , and nearly 40 TV films .
after Christie &apos;s death in 1976 , her remaining 36 % share of the company was inherited by her daughter , Ro@@ sal@@ ind H@@ icks , who passionately preserved her mother &apos;s works , image , and legacy until her own death 28 years later .
the family &apos;s share of the company allowed them to appoint 50 % of the board and the chairman , and thereby to retain a veto over new treatments , updated versions , and re@@ publications of her works .
in 1993 , H@@ icks founded the Aga@@ tha Christie Society and became its first president .
in 2004 her ob@@ itu@@ ary in &quot; The Telegraph &quot; commented that H@@ icks had been &quot; determined to remain true to her mother &apos;s vision and to protect the integrity of her creations &quot; and disapproved of &quot; merchan@@ dising &quot; activities .
upon H@@ icks &apos;s death on 28 October 2004 , both the Society and the Green@@ way Estate passed to Christie &apos;s grandson , Ma@@ the@@ w Pric@@ hard .
after his parents &apos; deaths , Pric@@ hard donated Green@@ way and its contents to the National Trust .
the Society is now chaired and managed by Aga@@ tha Christie &apos;s great @-@ grandson James Pric@@ hard .
Christie &apos;s family and family trusts , including James Pric@@ hard , continue to own the remaining 36 % stake in Aga@@ tha Christie Limited , and remain associated with the company .
James Pric@@ hard became the company &apos;s chairman in October 2015 .
the development of Christie &apos;s work continues apace .
Ma@@ the@@ w Pric@@ hard in his own right holds the copyright to some of his grandmother &apos;s later literary works .
in 1998 , Boo@@ ker sold a number of its non @-@ food assets to focus on its core business .
as part of that , its shares in Aga@@ tha Christie Limited were sold for £ 10@@ m to Ch@@ ori@@ on , a major international media company whose portfolio of well @-@ known authors &apos; works also included the literary estates of En@@ id B@@ ly@@ ton and Dennis Whe@@ at@@ ley .
in February 2012 , some years after a management buyout , Ch@@ ori@@ on found itself in financial difficulties , and began to sell off its literary assets on the market .
the process included the sale of Ch@@ ori@@ on &apos;s 64 % stake in Aga@@ tha Christie Limited to A@@ corn Media U.K. In 2014 , R@@ L@@ J Entertainment Inc. acquired A@@ corn Media U.K. , renamed it A@@ corn Media Enterprises , and incorporated it as the R@@ L@@ J@@ E UK development arm .
R@@ L@@ J Entertainment Inc. was founded by American entrepreneur Robert L. Johnson .
in late February 2014 , media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie &apos;s works in the UK and made plans with A@@ corn &apos;s co @-@ operation to air new productions for the 12@@ 5th anniversary of Christie &apos;s birth in 2015 .
as part of that deal , the BBC broadcast &quot; Partners In Crime &quot; and &quot; And Then There Were None &quot; , both in 2015 .
subsequent productions have included &quot; The Witness for the Prosecution &quot; but plans to telev@@ ise &quot; Or@@ deal by Inno@@ cence &quot; at Christmas 2017 were delayed due to controversy surrounding one of the cast members .
the three @-@ part adaptation aired in April 2018 .
a three @-@ part adaptation of &quot; The A.@@ B.C. Mur@@ ders &quot; starring John Mal@@ kov@@ ich and Rupert Gr@@ int began filming in June 2018 for later broadcast .

<p>
Christie &apos;s first book , &quot; The My@@ ster@@ ious Aff@@ air at St@@ yles &quot; , was published in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercul@@ e Po@@ i@@ rot , who became a long @-@ running character in Christie &apos;s works , appearing in 33 novels and 54 short stories .
Miss Jane Mar@@ ple , introduced in the short @-@ story collection &quot; The Thir@@ teen Problems &quot; in 1927 , was based on Christie &apos;s grandmother and her &quot; E@@ aling cron@@ ies . &quot; both Jane and Gran &quot; always expected the worst of everyone and everything , and were , with almost frightening accuracy , usually proved right . &quot; Mar@@ ple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories .
during the Second World War , Christie wrote two novels , &quot; Cur@@ tain &quot; and &quot; Sle@@ eping Mur@@ der &quot; , intended as the last cases of these two great detectives , Hercul@@ e Po@@ i@@ rot and Miss Mar@@ ple .
both books were sealed in a bank vault for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life , when she realised that she could not write any more novels .
these publications came on the heels of the success of the film version of &quot; Mur@@ der on the Orient Express &quot; in 1974 .
Christie became increasingly tired of Po@@ i@@ rot , much as Sir Arthur Con@@ an Doyle had grown weary of his character Sher@@ lock Holmes .
by the end of the 1930s , Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Po@@ i@@ rot &quot; in@@ suffer@@ able , &quot; and by the 1960s she felt that he was &quot; an eg@@ ocentr@@ ic creep . &quot; however , unlike Con@@ an Doyle , Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular .
she saw herself as an enter@@ tainer whose job was to produce what the public liked , and the public liked Po@@ i@@ rot .
she did marry off Po@@ i@@ rot &apos;s companion Captain Has@@ tings in an attempt to trim her cast commitments .
in contrast , Christie was fond of Miss Mar@@ ple .
however , the Belgian detective &apos;s titles outnumber the Mar@@ ple titles more than two to one .
this is largely because Christie wrote numerous Po@@ i@@ rot novels early in her career , while &quot; The Mur@@ der at the Vic@@ ar@@ age &quot; remained the sole Mar@@ ple novel until the 1940s .
Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Po@@ i@@ rot and Miss Mar@@ ple .
in a recording discovered and released in 2008 , Christie revealed the reason for this :
&quot; Hercul@@ e Po@@ i@@ rot , a complete ego@@ ist , would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spin@@ ster lady . Hercul@@ e Po@@ i@@ rot - a professional sle@@ uth - would not be at home at all in Miss Mar@@ ple &apos;s world .. &quot; Po@@ i@@ rot is the only fictional character to date to be given an ob@@ itu@@ ary in &quot; The New York Times &quot; , following the publication of &quot; Cur@@ tain &quot; .
it appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975 .
following the great success of &quot; Cur@@ tain &quot; , Christie gave permission for the release of &quot; Sle@@ eping Mur@@ der &quot; sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be released .
this may explain some of the inconsistencies compared to the rest of the Mar@@ ple series - for example , Colonel Arthur Ban@@ try , husband of Miss Mar@@ ple &apos;s friend Dolly , is still alive and well in &quot; Sle@@ eping Mur@@ der &quot; although he is noted as having died in books published earlier .
it may be that Christie simply did not have time to revise the manuscript before she died .
in 2013 , the Christie family gave their &quot; full backing &quot; to the release of a new Po@@ i@@ rot story , &quot; The Mon@@ ogram Mur@@ ders &quot; , which was written by British author Sophie Hannah .
Hannah later released a second Po@@ i@@ rot mystery , &quot; Closed Cas@@ ket &quot; , in 2016 .

Christie &apos;s reputation as &quot; The Queen of Crime &quot; was built upon the large number of classic mo@@ tif@@ s that she introduced , or for which she provided the most famous example .
Christie built these trop@@ es into what is now considered classic mystery structure : a murder is committed , there are multiple suspects who are all concealing secrets , and the detective gradually un@@ covers these secrets over the course of the story , discovering the most shocking twists towards the end .
culprits in Christie &apos;s mysteries have included children , policemen , narr@@ ators , already deceased individuals , and sometimes comprise no known suspects or all of the suspects .
at the end , in a Christie hallmark , the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room , explains the course of their deduc@@ tive reasoning , and reveals the guilty party , although there are exceptions in which it is left to the guilty party to explain all .
Christie allows some culprits to escape earthly justice for a variety of reasons , such as the passage of time , in which the most important characters have already died , or by active prescription .
such cases include &quot; The Witness for the Prosecution &quot; , &quot; Mur@@ der on the Orient Express &quot; , &quot; The Man in the Brown Su@@ it &quot; , &quot; El@@ ephan@@ ts Can Remember &quot; , and &quot; The Un@@ expected Guest &quot; .
there are instances in which a killer is not brought to justice in the legal sense but does die as a direct result of their plot , sometimes by their own hand at the direction or with the collusion of the detective .
this occurs in &quot; The Mur@@ der of Roger Ac@@ k@@ roy@@ d &quot; , &quot; Death on the Nile &quot; , &quot; Dum@@ b Witness &quot; , &quot; Cro@@ oked House &quot; , &quot; The Hol@@ low &quot; , &quot; The Mirror Cr@@ ack &apos;d from Side to Side &quot; , &quot; Cat Among the Pig@@ e@@ ons &quot; , &quot; Per@@ il at End House &quot; , &quot; N@@ eme@@ sis &quot; , &quot; Appointment with Death &quot; , &quot; The Secret Ad@@ versary &quot; , and &quot; Cur@@ tain &quot; .
in the last of these , no fewer than three culprits die during the course of the story .
in &quot; The A.@@ B.C. Mur@@ ders &quot; , the murderer has killed four innocent people and attempted to frame an unstable man for the crimes .
Hercul@@ e Po@@ i@@ rot , however , prevents this easy way out , ensuring a trial and hanging .
in &quot; And Then There Were None &quot; , the killer &apos;s own death is intrinsic to the plot ; the red herring is when and how the killer actually died .
however , stage , film , and television productions of some of these mysteries were traditionally saniti@@ zed with the culprits not evading some form of justice , for a variety of reasons - e.g. , cens@@ ors , plot clarity , and Christie &apos;s own changing tastes .
in &quot; Death Com@@ es as the End &quot; , set in ancient Egypt , the culprit is killed by one of the few surviving characters before he can claim another victim .
in some stories , the question remains unresolved of whether formal justice will ever be delivered , such as &quot; Five Little Pig@@ s &quot; and &quot; En@@ dless Night &quot; .
according to P. D. James , Christie often , but not always , made the un@@ likeli@@ est character the guilty party .
savvy readers could sometimes identify the culprit by simply identifying the least likely suspect .
on an edition of &quot; Desert Island Dis@@ cs &quot; in 2007 , Brian Al@@ dis@@ s claimed that Christie had told him that she wrote her books up to the last chapter , then decided who the most unlikely suspect was , after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to &quot; frame &quot; that person .
however , John Cur@@ ran &apos;s &quot; Aga@@ tha Christie : the Secret Not@@ e@@ books &quot; describes different working methods for every book in Christie &apos;s bibliography , contradicting the claim by Al@@ dis@@ s .

Christie &apos;s mature novels , from 1940 onwards , often have titles drawn from literature .
four are from Shakespeare : three are from the Bible : another six are from other works of literature :
in such cases , the original context of the title is usually printed as an epig@@ raph@@ .@@ Hopkins , Lisa .
who Ow@@ ns the Wood ?
appropri@@ ating A Mid@@ summer Night &apos;s Dream .
in Shakespe@@ arean Al@@ lusion in Crime Fic@@ tion , ed .
L. Hopkins , pp. 63 @-@ 103 .
similarly , the title of Christie &apos;s autobi@@ ographical travel book &quot; Come , Tell Me How You Live &quot; is a quote from verse three of the White Knight &apos;s poem , &quot; Hadd@@ ocks &apos; Eyes &quot; from chapter eight of &quot; Through the Looking @-@ Glass &quot; by Lewis Car@@ roll , and is a play on the word &quot; tell , &quot; an archaeological mound .
the title of &quot; The Mou@@ se@@ trap &quot; is purportedly an allusion to Shakespeare &apos;s play &quot; Hamlet &quot; , in which &quot; The Mou@@ se@@ trap &quot; is Hamlet &apos;s answer to Clau@@ dius &apos;s inquiry about the name of the play whose pro@@ lo@@ gue and first scene he and his court have just watched .
seven stories are built around words from well known children &apos;s nursery rhy@@ mes :
&quot; and Then There Were None &quot; , &quot; One , Two , Bu@@ ckle My Sho@@ e &quot; , &quot; Five Little Pig@@ s &quot; , &quot; Cro@@ oked House &quot; , &quot; A Poc@@ ket Full of R@@ ye &quot; , &quot; H@@ ick@@ ory Dick@@ ory D@@ ock &quot; , and &quot; Three Blind M@@ ice &quot; .
similarly , the novel Mrs Mc@@ Gin@@ ty &apos;s Dead is named after a children &apos;s game that is explained in the course of the novel .

Christie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work , particularly before the end of the Second World War , and particularly in regard to Italians , Jews , non @-@ Europeans , and sometimes Americans , the last usually as im@@ possibly na@@ ï@@ ve or un@@ informed .
for example , she described &quot; He@@ braic men with hook @-@ noses wearing rather flam@@ boy@@ ant jewellery &quot; in the first editions of the collection &quot; The My@@ ster@@ ious Mr Qu@@ in &quot; , in the short story &quot; The Soul of the C@@ rou@@ pier &quot; ; in later editions , the passage was edited to describe &quot; sal@@ low men &quot; wearing same .
in &quot; The Hol@@ low &quot; , published as late as 1946 , one of the more un@@ sympathetic characters is &quot; a Wh@@ itec@@ hap@@ el Jew@@ ess with dyed hair and a voice like a corn@@ cra@@ ke ... a small woman with a thick nose , h@@ enna red and a disagreeable voice . &quot; to contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions , Christie sometimes showed &quot; foreigners &quot; as victims or potential victims at the hands of English mal@@ ef@@ actors , such as , respectively , Ol@@ ga Semin@@ off and Katrina Re@@ ig@@ er .
Jewish characters are often seen as un @-@ English , but they are rarely the culprits .
often , she is affectionate or teasing with her prejudices .

often referred to as the &quot; Queen of Crime &quot; or &quot; Queen of My@@ stery , &quot; Aga@@ tha Christie is the world &apos;s best @-@ selling mystery writer and is considered a master of suspense , plotting , and character@@ isation .
some critics , however , have regarded Christie &apos;s plotting as superior to her skill with other literary elements .
novelist Raymond Chandler criticised her in his essay &quot; The Simple Art of Mur@@ der , &quot; and American literary critic Edmund Wilson was dismis@@ sive of Christie and the detective fiction genre generally in his &quot; New Yor@@ ker &quot; essay , &quot; Who Ca@@ res Who K@@ illed Roger Ac@@ k@@ roy@@ d ? &quot; in honour of the 12@@ 5th anniversary of her birth , 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher revealed their views on Christie &apos;s works .
many of the authors read Christie &apos;s novels first , before other mystery writers , in English or in their native language , influencing their own writing , and nearly all still view her as the &quot; Queen of Crime , &quot; and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors .
nearly all had one or more favour@@ ites among Christie &apos;s mysteries , and find her books good to read now , nearly 100 years after her first novel was published .
several of the authors would be very pleased to have their own novels in print in 100 years .
just one of the 25 authors held with Edmund Wilson &apos;s views .
Harper Collins also published a souvenir magazine &quot; Sh@@ ocking Real Mur@@ ders : behind Her Class@@ ic My@@ ster@@ ies &quot; .
the &quot; Guinness Book of World Records &quot; lists Christie as the best @-@ selling novelist of all time .
her novels have sold roughly 2 billion copies , and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world &apos;s most @-@ widely published books , behind only Shakespeare &apos;s works and the Bible .
half of the sales are of English language editions , and the other half in translation .
according to Index Trans@@ l@@ ation@@ um , she remains the most @-@ translated individual author - having been translated into at least 103 languages . &quot;
and Then There Were None &quot; is Christie &apos;s best @-@ selling novel , with 100 million sales to date , making it the world &apos;s best @-@ selling mystery ever , and one of the best @-@ selling books of all time .
in 2012 , Christie was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork - the Beatles &apos; &quot; S@@ g@@ t. Pep@@ per &apos;s Lon@@ ely Hear@@ ts Club Band &quot; album cover - to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admi@@ res .

the lure of the past came up to grab me .
to see a dagger slowly appearing , with its gold gl@@ int , through the sand was romantic .
the care@@ fulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archae@@ ologist myself .
Christie had a lifelong interest in archaeology .
she met her second husband , Sir Max M@@ allow@@ an , a distinguished archae@@ ologist , on a trip to the excavation site at U@@ r in 1930 .
but her fame as an author far surpassed his fame in archaeology .
prior to meeting M@@ allow@@ an , Christie had not had any extensive brushes with archaeology , but once the two married , they made sure to only go to sites where they could work together .
Christie accompanied M@@ allow@@ an on countless archaeological trips , spending 3 @-@ 4 months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at U@@ r , Ninev@@ eh , Tell Ar@@ p@@ achi@@ yah , Ch@@ agar Baz@@ ar , Tell Bra@@ k , and Nim@@ ru@@ d .
she wrote novels and short stories , but also contributed work to the archaeological sites , more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits , including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces , reconstructing pottery , developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings , and taking field notes .
Christie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations , and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor .
during their time in the Middle East , there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from M@@ allow@@ an &apos;s sites .
their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing , as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer &apos;s schemes .
the large amount of travel was reused in novels such as &quot; Mur@@ der on the Orient Express &quot; , as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself .
after the Second World War , she chron@@ ic@@ led her time in Syria with fondness in &quot; Come Tell Me How You Live &quot; .
anecdotes , memories , funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline , with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy .
from 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002 , The British Museum had an exhibit named &quot; Aga@@ tha Christie and Archae@@ ology : mystery in Mesopotam@@ ia &quot; , which presented the life of Aga@@ tha Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works .
</p>
<p>
many of the settings for Christie &apos;s books were directly inspired by the many archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max .
the extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them .
one such site featured in her work is the temple site of Abu Sim@@ bel , depicted in &quot; Death on the Nile &quot; .
also there is the great detail in which she describes life at the dig site in &quot; Mur@@ der in Mesopotam@@ ia &quot; .
among the characters in her books , Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts .
most notable are the characters of Dr. Eric Le@@ id@@ ner in &quot; Mur@@ der in Mesopotam@@ ia &quot; and Sign@@ or Ric@@ hetti in &quot; Death on the Nile &quot; , while many minor characters were archaeologists in &quot; They C@@ ame to Baghdad &quot; .

Christie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television .
several biographical programmes have been made , such as BBC television &apos;s &quot; &quot; , and in Season 3 , Epis@@ ode 1 of &quot; IT@@ V Perspectives &quot; :
&quot; the My@@ stery of Aga@@ tha Christie &quot; , hosted by David Su@@ chet , who plays Hercul@@ e Po@@ i@@ rot on television .
Christie has also been portrayed fic@@ tionally .
some of these portra@@ yals have explored and offered accounts of Christie &apos;s disappearance in 1926 , including the film &quot; Aga@@ tha &quot; , the &quot; Doctor Who &quot; episode &quot; The Unic@@ orn and the W@@ asp &quot; , with Fen@@ ella Wool@@ gar , in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the Ves@@ pi@@ form , and &quot; Aga@@ tha and the Truth of Mur@@ der &quot; , in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of Florence N@@ igh@@ tingale &apos;s god@@ daughter , Florence N@@ igh@@ tingale S@@ hore .
others , such as Hungarian film , &quot; Ko@@ jak Bud@@ ap@@ est@@ en &quot; create their own scenarios involving Christie &apos;s criminal skill .
in the TV play , &quot; Mur@@ der by the Book &quot; , Christie herself murdered one of her fictional @-@ turned @-@ real characters , Po@@ i@@ rot .
the heroine of Li@@ ar @-@ Soft &apos;s visual novel &quot; &quot; , Mary Clar@@ issa Christie , is based on the real @-@ life Christie .
Christie features as a character in Gay@@ lord Larsen &apos;s &quot; Dorothy and Aga@@ tha &quot; and &quot; The London B@@ lit@@ z Mur@@ ders &quot; by Max Allan Collins .
a fic@@ tion@@ alized account of Christie &apos;s disappearance is the central theme of a Korean musical , &quot; Aga@@ tha &quot; .
a young Aga@@ tha Christie is depicted in the Spanish historical television series &quot; Grand Hotel &quot; .
aiding the local detectives , Aga@@ tha finds inspiration to write her new novel .

Aaron is a prophet , high priest , and the brother of Moses in the Abra@@ ham@@ ic religions .
knowledge of Aaron , along with his brother Moses , comes exclusively from religious texts , such as the Bible and Qur@@ an .
the Hebrew Bible relates that , unlike Moses , who grew up in the Egyptian royal court , Aaron and his elder sister Miriam remained with their kin@@ smen in the eastern border @-@ land of Egypt .
when Moses first confronted the Egyptian king about the Israelites , Aaron served as his brother &apos;s spokesman to the Pharaoh .
part of the Law that Moses received from God at Sinai granted Aaron the pri@@ es@@ thood for himself and his male descendants , and he became the first High Pri@@ est of the Israelites .
Aaron died before the Israelites crossed the North Jordan river and he was buried on Mount H@@ or .
Aaron is also mentioned in the New Testament of the Bible .
</p>
<p>
according to the Book of Ex@@ o@@ dus , Aaron first functioned as Moses &apos; assistant .
because Moses complained that he could not speak well , God appointed Aaron as Moses &apos; &quot; prophet &quot; .
at the command of Moses , he let his rod turn into a snake .
then he stretched out his rod in order to bring on the first three plagues .
after that , Moses tended to act and speak for himself .
during the journey in the wilderness , Aaron was not always prominent or active .
at the battle with Amal@@ ek , he was chosen with H@@ ur to support the hand of Moses that held the &quot; rod of God . &quot; when the revelation was given to Moses at biblical Mount Sinai , he headed the elders of Israel who accompanied Moses on the way to the summit .
while Joshua went with Moses to the top , however , Aaron and H@@ ur remained below to look after the people .
from here on in Ex@@ o@@ dus , L@@ evi@@ tic@@ us and Numbers , Joshua appears in the role of Moses &apos; assistant while Aaron functions instead as the first high priest .
</p>
<p>
the books of Ex@@ o@@ dus , L@@ evi@@ tic@@ us and Numbers maintain that Aaron received from God a monopoly over the pri@@ es@@ thood for himself and his male descendants .
the family of Aaron had the exclusive right and responsibility to make offerings on the altar to Y@@ ah@@ weh .
the rest of his tribe , the Levites , were given subordinate responsibilities within the sanctuary .
Moses anointed and consecrated Aaron and his sons to the pri@@ es@@ thood , and arrayed them in the robes of office .
he also related to them God &apos;s detailed instructions for performing their duties while the rest of the Israelites listened .
Aaron and his successors as high priest were given control over the U@@ rim and T@@ hum@@ m@@ im by which the will of God could be determined .
God commissioned the Aar@@ on@@ ide priests to distinguish the holy from the common and the clean from the unclean , and to teach the divine laws to the Israelites .
the priests were also commissioned to bless the people .
when Aaron completed the altar offerings for the first time and , with Moses , &quot; blessed the people : and the glory of the appeared unto all the people : and there came a fire out from before the , and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat &#91; which &#93; when all the people saw , they shouted , and fell on their faces &quot; .
in this way , the institution of the Aar@@ on@@ ide pri@@ es@@ thood was established .
in later books of the Hebrew Bible , Aaron and his kin are not mentioned very often except in literature dating to the Babylon@@ ian captivity and later .
the books of Judges , Samuel and Kings mention priests and Levites , but do not mention the Aar@@ on@@ ides in particular .
the Book of Eze@@ ki@@ el , which devotes much attention to pri@@ estly matters , calls the pri@@ estly upper class the Zad@@ ok@@ ites after one of King David &apos;s priests .
it does reflect a two @-@ tier pri@@ es@@ thood with the Levites in subordinate position .
a two @-@ tier hierarchy of Aar@@ on@@ ides and Levites appears in Ez@@ ra , Ne@@ hem@@ iah and Chron@@ icles .
as a result , many historians think that Aar@@ on@@ ide families did not control the pri@@ es@@ thood in pre @-@ ex@@ il@@ ic Israel .
what is clear is that high priests claiming Aar@@ on@@ ide descent dominated the Second Temple period .
most scholars think the Tor@@ ah reached its final form early in this period , which may account for Aaron &apos;s prominence in Ex@@ o@@ dus , L@@ evi@@ tic@@ us and Numbers .
</p>
<p>
Aaron plays a leading role in several stories of conflicts during Israel &apos;s wilderness wander@@ ings .
during the prolonged absence of Moses on Mount Sinai , the people provoked Aaron to make a golden calf . .
this incident nearly caused God to destroy the Israelites .
Moses successfully intervened , but then led the loyal Levites in executing many of the culprits ; a plague afflicted those who were left .
Aaron , however , escaped punishment for his role in the affair , because of the interc@@ ession of Moses according to De@@ uter@@ onomy 9 : 20 .
later ret@@ ell@@ ings of this story almost always excuse Aaron for his role .
for example , in rab@@ bin@@ ic sources and in the Qur@@ an , Aaron was not the idol @-@ maker and upon Moses &apos; return begged his pardon because he felt mort@@ ally threatened by the Israelites .
on the day of Aaron &apos;s consec@@ ration , his oldest sons , Nad@@ ab and Abi@@ hu , were burned up by divine fire because they offered &quot; strange &quot; incense .
most interpreters think this story reflects a conflict between pri@@ estly families some time in Israel &apos;s past .
others argue that the story simply shows what can happen if the priests do not follow God &apos;s instructions given through Moses .
the Tor@@ ah generally depicts the siblings , Moses , Aaron , and Miriam , as the leaders of Israel after the Ex@@ o@@ dus , a view also reflected in the biblical Book of Mic@@ ah .
numbers 12 , however , reports that on one occasion , Aaron and Miriam complained about Moses &apos; exclusive claim to be the &apos; s prophet .
their presumption was rebu@@ ffed by God who affirmed Moses &apos; uniqueness as the one with whom the spoke face to face .
Miriam was punished with a skin disease that turned her skin white .
Aaron pleaded with Moses to inter@@ cede for her , and Miriam , after seven days &apos; quarantine , was healed .
Aaron once again escaped any retribution .
according to Numbers 16 @-@ 17 , a Lev@@ ite named Kor@@ ah led many in challenging Aaron &apos;s exclusive claim to the pri@@ es@@ thood .
when the rebels were punished by being swallowed up by the earth , Eleazar , the son of Aaron , was commissioned to take charge of the cens@@ ers of the dead priests .
and when a plague broke out among the people who had sympath@@ ized with the rebels , Aaron , at the command of Moses , took his cens@@ er and stood between the living and the dead till the plague abated .
to emphasize the validity of the Levites &apos; claim to the offerings and ti@@ thes of the Israelites , Moses collected a rod from the leaders of each tribe in Israel and laid the twelve rods overnight in the tent of meeting .
the next morning , Aaron &apos;s rod was found to have bud@@ ded and blossomed and produced ripe almonds .
the following chapter then details the distinction between Aaron &apos;s family and the rest of the Levites : while all the Levites were devoted to the care of the sanctuary , charge of its interior and the altar was committed to the Aar@@ onites alone .
</p>
<p>
Aaron , like Moses , was not permitted to enter Canaan with the Israelites because the two brothers showed impatience at Mer@@ i@@ bah in the last year of the desert pilgrimage , when Moses brought water out of a rock to quench the people &apos;s thirst .
although they had been commanded to speak to the rock , Moses struck it with the staff twice , which was construed as displaying a lack of deference to the .
there are two accounts of the death of Aaron in the Tor@@ ah .
numbers says that soon after the incident at Mer@@ i@@ bah , Aaron with his son Eleazar and Moses ascended Mount H@@ or .
there Moses stripped Aaron of his pri@@ estly garments and transferred them to Eleazar .
Aaron died on the summit of the mountain , and the people mourned for him thirty days .
the other account is found in De@@ uter@@ onomy 10 : 6 , where Aaron died at Mo@@ ser@@ ah and was buried .
there is a significant amount of travel between these two points , as the itinerary in Numbers 33 : 31 @-@ 37 records seven stages between Mo@@ ser@@ oth and Mount H@@ or .
Aaron was 123 at the time of his death .
</p>
<p>
Aaron married El@@ ish@@ e@@ ba , daughter of Am@@ min@@ ad@@ ab and sister of Nah@@ sh@@ on of the tribe of Judah .
the sons of Aaron were Eleazar , I@@ th@@ am@@ ar , and Nad@@ ab and Abi@@ hu .
a descendant of Aaron is an Aar@@ onite , or Ko@@ hen , meaning Pri@@ est .
any non @-@ Aar@@ onic Lev@@ ite - i.e. , descended from Levi but not from Aaron - assisted the L@@ evi@@ tical priests of the family of Aaron in the care of the tabernacle ; later of the temple .
the Gospel of Luke records that both Z@@ ech@@ ariah and Elizabeth and therefore their son John the Baptist were descendants of Aaron .
</p>
<p>
the older prophets and prophe@@ tical writers beheld in their priests the representatives of a religious form inferior to the prophe@@ tic truth ; men without the spirit of God and lacking the will @-@ power requisite to resist the multitude in its idol@@ at@@ rous pro@@ cli@@ vities .
thus Aaron , the first priest , ranks below Moses : he is his mouth@@ piece , and the execu@@ tor of the will of God revealed through Moses , although it is pointed out that it is said fifteen times in the Tor@@ ah that &quot; the Lord spoke to Moses &quot; and &quot; Aaron . &quot; under the influence of the pri@@ es@@ thood that shaped the destinies of the nation under Persian rule , a different ideal of the priest was formed , according to Mal@@ achi 2 : 4 @-@ 7 , and the prevailing tendency was to place Aaron on a footing equal with Moses .
&quot; at times Aaron , and at other times Moses , is mentioned first in Scripture - this is to show that they were of equal rank , &quot; says the Me@@ kh@@ il@@ ta of Rab@@ bi Ish@@ mael , which strongly implies this when introducing in its record of renowned men the glowing description of Aaron &apos;s ministr@@ ation .
in fulfilment of the promise of peaceful life , symbolized by the pouring of oil upon his head , Aaron &apos;s death , as described in the H@@ agg@@ adah , was of a wonderful tranquility .
accompanied by Moses , his brother , and by Eleazar , his son , Aaron went to the summit of Mount H@@ or , where the rock suddenly opened before him and a beautiful cave lit by a lamp presented itself to his view .
&quot; take off thy pri@@ estly ra@@ iment and place it upon thy son Eleazar ! &quot; said Moses ; &quot; and then follow me . &quot; Aaron did as commanded ; and they entered the cave , where was prepared a bed around which angels stood .
&quot; go lie down upon thy bed , my brother , &quot; Moses continued ; and Aaron obeyed without a murmur .
then his soul departed as if by a kiss from God .
the cave closed behind Moses as he left ; and he went down the hill with Eleazar , with garments rent , and crying :
&quot; alas , Aaron , my brother ! thou , the pillar of suppl@@ ication of Israel ! &quot; when the Israelites cried in bewilder@@ ment , &quot; Where is Aaron ? &quot; Ang@@ els were seen carrying Aaron &apos;s bi@@ er through the air .
a voice was then heard saying : &quot; the law of truth was in his mouth , and iniquity was not found on his lips : he walked with me in righteousness , and brought many back from sin &quot; .
he died , according to Se@@ der O@@ lam Rab@@ bah ix . , R. H. 2 , 3a , on the first of A@@ v .
the pillar of cloud which proceeded in front of Israel &apos;s camp disappeared at Aaron &apos;s death .
the seeming contradiction between Numbers 20 : 22 et seq. and De@@ uter@@ onomy 10 : 6 is solved by the rab@@ bis in the following manner :
Aaron &apos;s death on Mount H@@ or was marked by the defeat of the people in a war with the king of Ara@@ d , in consequence of which the Israelites fled , marching seven stations backward to Mo@@ ser@@ a , where they performed the rites of mourning for Aaron ; where@@ fore it is said :
&quot; there &#91; at Mo@@ ser@@ a &#93; died Aaron . &quot; the rab@@ bis also dwell with special laud@@ ation on the brotherly sentiment which united Aaron and Moses .
when the latter was appointed ruler and Aaron high priest , neither betrayed any jealousy ; instead they rejoiced in one another &apos;s greatness .
when Moses at first declined to go to Pharaoh , saying :
&quot; O my Lord , send , I pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send &quot; , he was unwilling to deprive Aaron , his brother , of the high position the latter had held for so many years ; but the Lord reassured him , saying :
&quot; behold , when he see@@ th thee , he will be glad in his heart &quot; .
indeed , Aaron was to find his reward , says Shim@@ on bar Y@@ oc@@ hai ; for that heart which had leaped with joy over his younger brother &apos;s rise to glory greater than his was decorated with the U@@ rim and T@@ hum@@ m@@ im , which were to &quot; be upon Aaron &apos;s heart when he go@@ eth in before the Lord &quot; .
Moses and Aaron met in gladness of heart , kissing each other as true brothers , and of them it is written :
&quot; behold how good and how pleasant &#91; it is &#93; for brethren to dwell together in unity ! &quot; .
of them it is said : &quot; mercy and truth are met together ; righteousness and peace have kissed &#91; each other &#93; &quot; ; for Moses stood for righteousness , according to De@@ uter@@ onomy 33 : 21 , and Aaron for peace , according to .
again , mercy was person@@ ified in Aaron , according to De@@ uter@@ onomy 33 : 8 , and truth in Moses , according to Numbers 12 : 7 .
when Moses poured the oil of ano@@ intment upon the head of Aaron , Aaron modestly shrank back and said :
&quot; who knows whether I have not cast some blemish upon this sacred oil so as to forfeit this high office . &quot; then the She@@ k@@ hin@@ ah spoke the words :
&quot; behold the precious ointment upon the head , that ran down upon the beard of Aaron , that even went down to the skirts of his garment , is as pure as the dew of Her@@ mon &quot; .
according to Tan@@ hum@@ a , Aaron &apos;s activity as a prophet began earlier than that of Moses .
Hill@@ el held Aaron up as an example , saying : &quot; be of the disciples of Aaron , loving peace and pursuing peace ; love your fellow creatures and draw them nigh unto the Law ! &quot; this is further illustrated by the tradition preserved in A@@ bot de @-@ Rab@@ bi Nat@@ an 12 , San@@ hedr@@ in 6@@ b , and elsewhere , according to which Aaron was an ideal priest of the people , far more beloved for his kindly ways than was Moses .
while Moses was stern and uncompromising , broo@@ king no wrong , Aaron went about as peac@@ emaker , reconciling man and wife when he saw them estranged , or a man with his neighbor when they quarreled , and winning evil @-@ doers back into the right way by his friendly intercourse .
the mourning of the people at Aaron &apos;s death was greater , therefore , than at that of Moses ; for whereas , when Aaron died the whole house of Israel wept , including the women , Moses was be@@ w@@ ailed by &quot; the sons of Israel &quot; only .
even in the making of the Golden Cal@@ f the rab@@ bis find extenuating circumstances for Aaron .
his fortitude and silent submission to the will of God on the loss of his two sons are referred to as an excellent example to men how to glorify God in the midst of great affliction .
especially significant are the words represented as being spoken by God after the princes of the Twelve Tri@@ bes had brought their dedication offerings into the newly reared Tab@@ er@@ nacle :
&quot; say to thy brother Aaron : greater than the gifts of the princes is thy gift ; for thou art called upon to kindle the light , and , while the sacrifices shall last only as long as the Temple lasts , thy light shall last forever . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in the Eastern Orthodox and Mar@@ onite churches , Aaron is ven@@ erated as a saint whose feast day is shared with his brother Moses and celebrated on September 4 . .
Aaron is also commemorated with other Old Testament saints on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers , the Sunday before Christmas .
Aaron is commemorated as one of the Holy For@@ ef@@ athers in the Calendar of Sain@@ ts of the Armenian Apost@@ olic Church on July 30 .
he is commemorated on July 1 in the modern Latin calendar and in the Syri@@ ac Calendar .
</p>
<p>
in The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat@@ ter @-@ day Sain@@ ts , the Aar@@ onic order is the lesser order of pri@@ es@@ thood , comprising the grades of de@@ acon , teacher , and priest .
the chief office of the Aar@@ onic pri@@ es@@ thood is the presiding bish@@ op@@ ric ; the head of the pri@@ es@@ thood is the bishop .
each ward includes a quorum of one or more of each office of the Aar@@ onic pri@@ es@@ thood .
in the Community of Christ , the Aar@@ onic order of pri@@ es@@ thood is regarded as an append@@ age to the Mel@@ chis@@ e@@ dec order , and consists of the pri@@ es@@ thood offices of de@@ acon , teacher , and priest .
while differing in responsibilities , these offices , along with those of the Mel@@ chi@@ si@@ dec order , are regarded as equal before God .
</p>
<p>
Aaron is also mentioned in the Qur@@ an as a prophet of God .
the Qur@@ an praises Aaron repeatedly , calling him a &quot; believing servant &quot; as well as one who was &quot; guided &quot; and one of the &quot; vic@@ tors . &quot; Aaron is important in Islam for his role in the events of the Ex@@ o@@ dus , in which , according to the Qur@@ an and Muslim tradition , he preached with his elder brother , Moses , to the Pharaoh of the Ex@@ o@@ dus .
Aaron &apos;s significance in Islam , however , is not limited to his role as the helper of Moses .
Islamic tradition also accords Aaron the role of a patri@@ arch , as tradition records that the pri@@ estly descent came through Aaron &apos;s lineage , which included the entire House of Am@@ ran .
</p>
<p>
the Qur@@ an contains numerous references to Aaron , both by name and without name .
it says that he was a descendant of Abraham and makes it clear that both he and Moses were sent together to warn the Pharaoh about God &apos;s punishment .
it further adds that Moses had earlier prayed to God to strengthen his own ministry with Aaron and that Aaron helped Moses as he too was a prophet , and very eloquent in matters of speech and discourse .
the Qur@@ an adds that both Moses and Aaron were entrusted to establish places of dwelling for the Israelites in Egypt , and to convert those houses into places of worship for God .
the incident of the Golden Cal@@ f as it is narrated in the Qur@@ an paints Aaron in a positive light .
the Qur@@ an also nar@@ rates that , centuries later , when the &quot; Tab@@ ut &quot; returned to Israel , it contained &quot; relics from the family of Moses and relics from the family of Aaron &quot; .
</p>
<p>
Muhammad , in many of his sayings , speaks of Aaron .
in the event of the Mi &apos;@@ raj , his miraculous ascension through the Heaven@@ s , Muhammad is said to have encountered Aaron in the fifth heaven .
according to old scholars , including Ibn His@@ ham , Muhammad , in particular , mentioned the beauty of Aaron when he encountered him in Heaven .
Martin L@@ ings , in his biographical &quot; Muhammad &quot; , speaks of Muhammad &apos;s wonder@@ ment at seeing fellow prophets in their heavenly glory :
of Joseph he said that his face had the splend@@ our of the moon at its full , and that he had been endowed with no less than the half of all existing beauty .
yet this did not diminish Muhammad &apos;s wonder@@ ment at his brethren , and he mentioned in particular the great beauty of Aaron .
Aaron was also mentioned by Muhammad in likeness to &quot; Ali . Muhammad had left &quot; Ali to look after his family , but the hypocrit@@ es of the time begun to spread the rumor that the prophet found &quot; Ali a burden and was relieved to be rid of his presence . &quot; Ali , grieved at hearing this wicked ta@@ unt , told Muhammad what the local people were saying .
in reply , the Prophet said : &quot; they lie , I bade thee remain for the sake of what I had left behind me . so return and represent me in my family and in thine . art thou not content , O &quot; Ali , that thou should be unto me as Aaron was unto Moses , save that after me there is no prophet . &quot;
</p>
<p>
according to Islamic tradition , the tomb of Aaron is located on &quot; Jabal Har@@ un &quot; , near Pe@@ tra in Jordan .
at above sea @-@ level , it is the highest peak in the area ; and it is a place of great sanctity to the local people for here .
a 14th @-@ century Mam@@ lu@@ k mosque stands here with its white dome visible from most areas in and around Pe@@ tra .

<p>
although his father is described as both an apostle and a prophet , Aaron is merely described as a prophet .
the Kit@@ ab @-@ I @-@ Iq@@ an describes Im@@ ran as being his father .

Aaron appears paired with Moses frequently in Jewish and Christian art , especially in the illustrations of manuscript and printed Bi@@ bles .
he can usually be distinguished by his pri@@ estly v@@ est@@ ments , especially his turban or mit@@ er and jewel@@ ed breast@@ plate .
he frequently holds a censor or , sometimes , his flowering rod .
Aaron also appears in scenes depicting the wilderness Tab@@ er@@ nacle and its altar , as already in the third @-@ century fres@@ cos in the synagogue at D@@ ura @-@ Euro@@ pos in Syria .
an eleventh @-@ century portable silver altar from Ful@@ da , Germany depicts Aaron with his censor , and is located in the Mus@@ ée National de l &apos;@@ Age Mé@@ di@@ é@@ val@@ e in Paris .
this is also how he appears in the fron@@ ti@@ spi@@ eces of early printed Passover H@@ agg@@ ad@@ ot and occasionally in church sculptures .
Aaron has rarely been the subject of portraits , such as those by Anton K@@ ern &#91; 17@@ 10 @-@ 1747 &#93; and by Pier Francesco M@@ ola &#91; c .
Christian artists sometimes portray Aaron as a prophet holding a scroll , as in a twelfth @-@ century sculpture from the Cathedral of No@@ yon in the Metropolitan Museum of Art , New York and often in Eastern Orthodox icons .
illustrations of the Golden Cal@@ f story usually include him as well - most notably in Nicolas P@@ ous@@ sin &apos;s &quot; The Ad@@ oration of the Golden Cal@@ f &quot; .
finally , some artists interested in validating later pri@@ es@@ th@@ oods have painted the ordination of Aaron and his sons .
Harry Anderson &apos;s realistic portrayal is often reproduced in the literature of the Lat@@ ter Day Sain@@ ts .

Ir@@ win Allen G@@ ins@@ berg was an American poet , philosopher and writer .
he is considered to be one of the leading figures of both the Be@@ at Generation during the 1950s and the counter@@ culture that soon followed .
he vigorously opposed militarism , economic materialism and sexual repression and was known as embodying various aspects of this counter@@ culture , such as his views on drugs , hostility to bureaucracy and openness to Eastern religions .
he was one of many influential American writers of his time known as the Be@@ at Generation , which included famous writers such as Jack Ker@@ ou@@ ac and William S. Bur@@ rough@@ s .
G@@ ins@@ berg is best known for his poem &quot; How@@ l , &quot; in which he denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States .
in 1956 , &quot; How@@ l &quot; was seized by San Francisco police and US Customs .
in 1957 , it attracted widespread publicity when it became the subject of an obscen@@ ity trial , as it described heterosexual and homosexual sex at a time when so@@ dom@@ y laws made homosexual acts a crime in every U.S. state .
&quot; howl &quot; reflected G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s own homosexuality and his relationships with a number of men , including Peter Or@@ lov@@ sky , his lifelong partner .
judge Cla@@ yton W. Horn ruled that &quot; How@@ l &quot; was not obscene , adding , &quot; Would there be any freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vap@@ id innocuous euphem@@ isms ? &quot; G@@ ins@@ berg was a practicing Buddhist who studied Eastern religious disciplines extensively .
he lived modestly , buying his clothing in second @-@ hand stores and residing in down@@ scale apartments in New York &apos;s East Village .
one of his most influential teachers was the Tibetan Buddhist Ch@@ ö@@ gy@@ am Tr@@ ung@@ pa , the founder of the Nar@@ op@@ a Institute in Boul@@ der , Colorado .
at Tr@@ ung@@ pa &apos;s urging , G@@ ins@@ berg and poet Anne Wald@@ man started The Jack Ker@@ ou@@ ac School of Dis@@ embodied Po@@ e@@ tics there in 1974 .
G@@ ins@@ berg took part in decades of non @-@ violent political protest against everything from the Vietnam War to the War on Drugs .
his poem &quot; September on Jess@@ ore Road , &quot; calling attention to the plight of Bangladeshi refugees , exemplifies what the literary critic Helen V@@ end@@ ler described as G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s tireless persistence in protesting against &quot; imperial politics , and persecution of the powerless . &quot; his collection &quot; The Fall of America &quot; shared the annual U.S. National Book Award for Poetry in 1974 .
in 1979 he received the National Arts Club gold medal and was induc@@ ted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters .
G@@ ins@@ berg was a Pul@@ itzer Prize fin@@ alist in 1995 for his book &quot; Co@@ smo@@ politan Gre@@ etings : poems 1986 @-@ 1992 &quot; .

<p>
G@@ ins@@ berg was born into a Jewish family in New@@ ark , New Jersey , and grew up in nearby Pater@@ son .
as a young teenager , G@@ ins@@ berg began to write letters to &quot; The New York Times &quot; about political issues , such as World War II and workers &apos; rights .
while in high school , G@@ ins@@ berg began reading Walt Whitman , inspired by his teacher &apos;s passionate reading .
in 1943 , G@@ ins@@ berg graduated from East@@ side High School and briefly attended Mont@@ cl@@ air State College before entering Columbia University on a scholarship from the Young Men &apos;s Hebrew Association of Pater@@ son .
in 1945 , he joined the Merchant Marine to earn money to continue his education at Columbia .
while at Columbia , G@@ ins@@ berg contributed to the &quot; Columbia Review &quot; literary journal , the &quot; J@@ ester &quot; humor magazine , won the Wood@@ berry Poetry Prize , served as president of the Phil@@ ol@@ ex@@ ian Society , and joined Bo@@ ar &apos;s Head Society .
G@@ ins@@ berg has stated that he considered his required freshman seminar in Great Books , taught by Lionel Tr@@ illing , to be his favorite Columbia course .
charters , Ann &quot; G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s Life . &quot; American National Bi@@ ography Online .

according to The Poetry Foundation , G@@ ins@@ berg spent several months in a mental institution after he pleaded insanity during a hearing .
he was allegedly being prosecuted for harb@@ oring stolen goods in his dorm room .
it was noted that the stolen property was not his , but belonged to an acquaintance .

<p>
G@@ ins@@ berg referred to his parents , in a 1985 interview , as &quot; old @-@ fashioned delic@@ at@@ ess@@ en philosophers . &quot; his father , Louis G@@ ins@@ berg , was a published poet and a high school teacher .
G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s mother , Naomi Liver@@ g@@ ant G@@ ins@@ berg , was affected by a psychological illness that was never properly diagnosed .
she was also an active member of the Communist Party and took G@@ ins@@ berg and his brother Eugene to party meetings .
G@@ ins@@ berg later said that his mother &quot; made up bedtime stories that all went something like : &apos; the good king rode forth from his castle , saw the suffering workers and healed them . &apos; &quot; of his father G@@ ins@@ berg said &quot; My father would go around the house either re@@ citing Emily Dick@@ inson and Long@@ fellow under his breath or attacking T. S. Eliot for ruining poetry with his &apos; obs@@ cur@@ anti@@ sm . &apos; I grew suspicious of both sides . &quot; Naomi G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s mental illness often manifested as paranoid delu@@ sions .
she would claim , for example , that the president had implanted listening devices in their home and that her mother @-@ in @-@ law was trying to kill her .
her suspicion of those around her caused Naomi to draw closer to young Allen , &quot; her little pet , &quot; as Bill Morgan says in his biography of G@@ ins@@ berg , titled , &quot; I Celebr@@ ate My@@ self : the Some@@ what Private Life of Allen G@@ ins@@ berg &quot; .
she also tried to kill herself by s@@ lit@@ ting her wrists and was soon taken to Gre@@ y@@ stone , a mental hospital ; she would spend much of G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s youth in mental hospitals .
his experiences with his mother and her mental illness were a major inspiration for his two major works , &quot; How@@ l &quot; and his long autobi@@ ographical poem &quot; Kad@@ dish for Naomi G@@ ins@@ berg . &quot; when he was in junior high school , he accompanied his mother by bus to her therapist .
the trip deeply disturbed G@@ ins@@ berg - he mentioned it and other moments from his childhood in &quot; Kad@@ dish . &quot; his experiences with his mother &apos;s mental illness and her institutionalization are also frequently referred to in &quot; How@@ l . &quot; for example , &quot; Pil@@ grim State , Rock@@ land , and Grey Stone &apos;s fo@@ eti@@ d halls &quot; is a reference to institutions frequented by his mother and Carl Solomon , ostensibly the subject of the poem :
Pil@@ grim State Hospital and Rock@@ land State Hospital in New York and Gre@@ y@@ stone Park Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey .
in a letter she wrote to G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s brother Eugene , she said , &quot; God &apos;s inform@@ ers come to my bed , and God himself I saw in the sky .
the sunshine showed too , a key on the side of the window for me to get out .
the yellow of the sunshine , also showed the key on the side of the window . &quot;
these letters and the absence of a facility to recite kad@@ dish inspired G@@ ins@@ berg to write &quot; Kad@@ dish &quot; which makes references to many details from Naomi &apos;s life , G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s experiences with her , and the letter , including the lines &quot; the key is in the light &quot; and &quot; the key is in the window . &quot;

in G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate Luci@@ en Carr , who introduced him to a number of future Be@@ at writers , including Jack Ker@@ ou@@ ac , William S. Bur@@ rough@@ s , and John Cl@@ ell@@ on Holmes .
they bonded , because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth , a potential that existed outside the strict con@@ form@@ ist confines of post @-@ World War II , McCar@@ thy @-@ era America .
G@@ ins@@ berg and Carr talked excitedly about a &quot; New Vision &quot; , for literature and America .
Carr also introduced G@@ ins@@ berg to Ne@@ al Cass@@ ady , for whom G@@ ins@@ berg had a long infat@@ uation .
in the first chapter of his 1957 novel &quot; On the Road &quot; Ker@@ ou@@ ac described the meeting between G@@ ins@@ berg and Cass@@ ady .
Ker@@ ou@@ ac saw them as the dark and light side of their &quot; New Vision , &quot; a perception stemming partly from G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s association with communism , of which Ker@@ ou@@ ac had become increasingly di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful .
though G@@ ins@@ berg was never a member of the Communist Party , Ker@@ ou@@ ac named him &quot; Carlo Marx &quot; in &quot; On the Road &quot; .
this was a source of strain in their relationship .
also , in New York , G@@ ins@@ berg met Gregory Cor@@ so in the P@@ ony Stable Bar .
Cor@@ so , recently released from prison , was supported by the P@@ ony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting .
G@@ ins@@ berg claims he was immediately attracted to Cor@@ so , who was straight , but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison .
G@@ ins@@ berg was even more struck by reading Cor@@ so &apos;s poems , realizing Cor@@ so was &quot; spiritually gifted . &quot; G@@ ins@@ berg introduced Cor@@ so to the rest of his inner circle .
in their first meeting at the P@@ ony Stable , Cor@@ so showed G@@ ins@@ berg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sun@@ bathed naked in the window .
amazingly , the woman happened to be G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s girlfriend that he was living with during one of his for@@ ays into hetero@@ sexuality .
G@@ ins@@ berg took Cor@@ so over to their apartment .
there the woman proposed sex with Cor@@ so , who was still very young and fled in fear .
G@@ ins@@ berg introduced Cor@@ so to Ker@@ ou@@ ac and Bur@@ rough@@ s and they began to travel together .
G@@ ins@@ berg and Cor@@ so remained lifelong friends and collaborators .
shortly after this period in G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s life , he became roman@@ tically involved with El@@ ise N@@ ada Cow@@ en after meeting her through Alex Gre@@ er , a philosophy professor at Barn@@ ard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Be@@ at generation &apos;s period of development .
as a Barn@@ ard student , El@@ ise Cow@@ en extensively read the poetry of Ez@@ ra P@@ ound and T. S. Eliot , when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Sk@@ ir , among other Be@@ at players .
as Cow@@ en had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time , Be@@ at poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona .
while at Barn@@ ard , Cow@@ en earned the nickname &quot; Be@@ at Alice &quot; as she had joined a small group of anti @-@ establishment artists and vi@@ sion@@ aries known to outsiders as be@@ at@@ ni@@ ks , and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cow@@ en in her books , including &quot; Minor Characters &quot; and &quot; Come and Jo@@ in the Dance &quot; , which expressed the two women &apos;s experiences in the Barn@@ ard and Columbia Be@@ at community .
through his association with El@@ ise Cow@@ en , G@@ ins@@ berg discovered that they shared a mutual friend , Carl Solomon , to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem &quot; How@@ l . &quot; this poem is considered an autobiography of G@@ ins@@ berg up to 1955 , and a brief history of the Be@@ at Generation through its references to his relationship to other Be@@ at artists of that time .
</p>
<p>
in 1948 in an apartment in Har@@ lem , G@@ ins@@ berg had an auditory halluc@@ ination while reading the poetry of William Blake .
at first , G@@ ins@@ berg claimed to have heard the voice of God but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading &quot; Ah ! Sun @-@ flower &quot; , &quot; The Sick Rose &quot; , and &quot; Little Girl Lost &quot; , also described by G@@ ins@@ berg as &quot; voice of the ancient of days . &quot; the experience lasted several days .
G@@ ins@@ berg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe .
he looked at lat@@ tic@@ e@@ work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that ; he then looked at the sky and intu@@ ited that some hand had crafted that also , or rather , that the sky was the hand that crafted itself .
he explained that this halluc@@ ination was not inspired by drug use but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs .
G@@ ins@@ berg stated : &quot; living blue hand itself . or that God was in front of my eyes - existence itself was God , &quot; and &quot; And it was a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe than I &apos;d been existing in . &quot;

G@@ ins@@ berg moved to San Francisco during the 1950s .
before &quot; How@@ l and Other Po@@ ems &quot; was published in 1956 by City Li@@ ghts Book@@ shop , he worked as a market researcher .
in 1954 , in San Francisco , G@@ ins@@ berg met Peter Or@@ lov@@ sky , with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner .
selections from their correspondence have been published .
also in San Francisco , G@@ ins@@ berg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance and other poets who would later be associated with the Be@@ at Generation in a broader sense .
G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s mentor William Carlos Williams wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance fig@@ ure@@ head Kenneth R@@ ex@@ ro@@ th , who then introduced G@@ ins@@ berg into the San Francisco poetry scene .
there , G@@ ins@@ berg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College : Gary Sn@@ y@@ der , Philip Whal@@ en , and L@@ ew Wel@@ ch .
in 1959 , along with poets John Kelly , Bob Kau@@ f@@ man , A. D. Win@@ ans , and William Mar@@ gol@@ is , G@@ ins@@ berg was one of the founders of the &quot; Be@@ ati@@ tude &quot; poetry magazine .
W@@ ally Hed@@ rick - a painter and co @-@ founder of the Six Gallery - approached G@@ ins@@ berg in mid @-@ 1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery .
at first , G@@ ins@@ berg refused , but once he had written a rough draft of &quot; How@@ l , &quot; he changed his &quot; fucking mind , &quot; as he put it .
G@@ ins@@ berg advertised the event as &quot; Six Po@@ ets at the Six Gallery . &quot; one of the most important events in Be@@ at my@@ thos , known simply as &quot; The Six Gallery reading &quot; took place on October 7 , 1955 .
the event , in essence , brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Be@@ at Generation .
of more personal significance to G@@ ins@@ berg , the reading that night included the first public presentation of &quot; How@@ l , &quot; a poem that brought worldwide fame to G@@ ins@@ berg and to many of the poets associated with him .
an account of that night can be found in Ker@@ ou@@ ac &apos;s novel &quot; The Dharma B@@ ums &quot; , describing how change was collected from audience members to buy ju@@ gs of wine , and G@@ ins@@ berg reading passionately , drunken , with arms outstretched .
G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s principal work , &quot; How@@ l , &quot; is well known for its opening line :
&quot; I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness , starving hysterical naked ... &quot; &quot; How@@ l &quot; was considered scandalous at the time of its publication , because of the ra@@ w@@ ness of its language .
shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco &apos;s City Li@@ ghts Book@@ store , it was banned for obscen@@ ity .
the ban became a among defenders of the First Amendment , and was later lifted , after Judge Cla@@ yton W. Horn declared the poem to possess re@@ deeming artistic value .
G@@ ins@@ berg and Shi@@ g Mu@@ ra@@ o , the City Li@@ ghts manager who was jailed for selling &quot; How@@ l , &quot; became lifelong friends .
</p>
<p>
in 1957 , G@@ ins@@ berg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco .
after a spell in Morocco , he and Peter Or@@ lov@@ sky joined Gregory Cor@@ so in Paris .
Cor@@ so introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue G@@ î@@ t @-@ le @-@ Co@@ eur that was to become known as the Be@@ at Hotel .
they were soon joined by Bur@@ rough@@ s and others .
it was a productive , creative time for all of them .
there , G@@ ins@@ berg began his epic poem &quot; Kad@@ dish , &quot; Cor@@ so composed &quot; Bom@@ b &quot; and &quot; Marriage &quot; , and Bur@@ rough@@ s put together &quot; Na@@ ked Lun@@ ch &quot; from previous writings .
this period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman , who moved in at about the same time , and took pictures constantly of the residents of the &quot; hotel &quot; until it closed in 1963 .
during 1962 @-@ 1963 , G@@ ins@@ berg and Or@@ lov@@ sky travelled extensively across India , living half a year at a time in Calcutta and Ben@@ ares .
also during this time , he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Beng@@ ali poets of the time including Shak@@ ti Ch@@ att@@ op@@ ad@@ hy@@ ay and Sun@@ il G@@ ang@@ op@@ ad@@ hy@@ ay .
G@@ ins@@ berg had several political connections in India ; most notably Pu@@ pu@@ l Jay@@ ak@@ ar who helped him extend his stay in India when the authorities were eager to expel him .
</p>
<p>
in May 1965 , G@@ ins@@ berg arrived in London , and offered to read anywhere for free .
shortly after his arrival , he gave a reading at Better Books , which was described by Jeff N@@ ut@@ tall as &quot; the first healing wind on a very parched collective mind . &quot; Tom McGra@@ th wrote :
&quot; this could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England - or at least in the history of English Poetry . &quot; soon after the bookshop reading , plans were hatched for the International Poetry In@@ carnation , which was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 11 , 1965 .
the event attracted an audience of 7,000 , who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures , including G@@ ins@@ berg , Adrian Mitchell , Alexander T@@ roc@@ chi , Harry F@@ ain@@ light , An@@ sel@@ m Hol@@ lo , Christopher Lo@@ gue , George Mac@@ Beth , Gregory Cor@@ so , Lawrence Fer@@ lin@@ gh@@ etti , Michael Hor@@ ov@@ itz , Simon V@@ ink@@ en@@ oo@@ g , Spi@@ ke Hawkins and Tom McGra@@ th .
the event was organized by G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s friend , the film@@ maker Barbara Rub@@ in .
Peter White@@ head documented the event on film and released it as &quot; Whol@@ ly Comm@@ union &quot; .
a book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lor@@ ri@@ mer in the UK and Gro@@ ve Press in US .

though the term &quot; Be@@ at &quot; is most accurately applied to G@@ ins@@ berg and his closest friends , the term &quot; Be@@ at Generation &quot; has become associated with many of the other poets G@@ ins@@ berg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
a key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with G@@ ins@@ berg .
friendship with Ker@@ ou@@ ac or Bur@@ rough@@ s might also apply , but both writers later strove to dis@@ associate themselves from the name &quot; Be@@ at Generation . &quot; part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of G@@ ins@@ berg as the leader .
G@@ ins@@ berg never claimed to be the leader of a movement .
he claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes .
some of these friends include : David Am@@ ram , Bob Kau@@ f@@ man ; Diane di Pri@@ ma ; Jim Co@@ hn ; poets associated with the Black Mountain College such as Robert Cre@@ el@@ ey and Denise L@@ ever@@ tov ; poets associated with the New York School such as Frank O &apos;@@ Har@@ a and Kenneth Ko@@ ch .
Le@@ Ro@@ i Jones before he became A@@ miri Bar@@ aka , who , after reading &quot; How@@ l , &quot; wrote a letter to G@@ ins@@ berg on a sheet of toilet paper .
through a party organized by A@@ miri Bar@@ aka , G@@ ins@@ berg was introduced to Lang@@ ston Hughes while Or@@ nette Coleman played sa@@ x@@ ophone .
later in his life , G@@ ins@@ berg formed a bridge between the beat movement of the 1950s and the hip@@ pies of the 1960s , be@@ fri@@ ending , among others , Timothy Lear@@ y , Ken Kes@@ ey , and Bob D@@ ylan .
G@@ ins@@ berg gave his last public reading at Book@@ smith , a bookstore in the Ha@@ ight @-@ Ash@@ bury neighborhood of San Francisco , a few months before his death .
in 1993 , G@@ ins@@ berg visited the University of Maine at O@@ ron@@ o to pay homage to the 90 @-@ year @-@ old great Carl Rak@@ o@@ si .
</p>
<p>
in 1950 , Ker@@ ou@@ ac began studying Buddhism and shared what he learned from D@@ wi@@ ght Go@@ dd@@ ard &apos;s &quot; Buddhist Bible &quot; with G@@ ins@@ berg .
G@@ ins@@ berg first heard about the Four Noble Tru@@ ths and such su@@ tr@@ as as the Diamond Su@@ tra at this time .
G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s spiritual journey began early on with his spontaneous visions , and continued with an early trip to India with Gary Sn@@ y@@ der .
Sn@@ y@@ der had previously spent time in Kyoto to study at the First Zen Institute at Da@@ it@@ ok@@ u @-@ ji Monastery .
at one point , Sn@@ y@@ der chan@@ ted the Pra@@ j@@ na@@ param@@ ita , which in G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s words &quot; blew my mind . &quot; his interest pi@@ qu@@ ed , G@@ ins@@ berg traveled to meet the Dalai Lama as well as the K@@ arm@@ apa at Rum@@ te@@ k Monastery .
continuing on his journey , G@@ ins@@ berg met Dud@@ j@@ om R@@ in@@ po@@ che in Kal@@ imp@@ ong , who taught him :
&quot; if you see something horrible , don &apos;t cling to it , and if you see something beautiful , don &apos;t cling to it . &quot; after returning to the United States , a chance encounter on a New York City street with Ch@@ ö@@ gy@@ am Tr@@ ung@@ pa R@@ in@@ po@@ che , a Kag@@ yu and Ny@@ ing@@ ma Tibetan Buddhist master , led to Tr@@ ung@@ pa becoming his friend and lifelong teacher .
G@@ ins@@ berg helped Tr@@ ung@@ pa and New York poet Anne Wald@@ man in founding the Jack Ker@@ ou@@ ac School of Dis@@ embodied Po@@ e@@ tics at Nar@@ op@@ a University in Boul@@ der , Colorado .
G@@ ins@@ berg was also involved with Krish@@ na@@ ism .
he had started incorporating chanting the Hare Krishna mantra into his religious practice in the mid @-@ 1960s .
this relationship is documented by Sat@@ s@@ var@@ up@@ a d@@ asa Go@@ sw@@ ami in his biographical account &quot; Sr@@ ila Pra@@ b@@ h@@ up@@ ada L@@ il@@ am@@ r@@ ta &quot; .
G@@ ins@@ berg donated money , materials , and his reputation to help the Sw@@ ami establish the first temple , and toured with him to promote his cause .
despite dis@@ agreeing with many of B@@ hak@@ tiv@@ ed@@ anta Sw@@ ami &apos;s required prohibitions , G@@ ins@@ berg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly as part of his philosophy and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy .
he was glad that B@@ hak@@ tiv@@ ed@@ anta Sw@@ ami , an authentic sw@@ ami from India , was now trying to spread the chanting in America .
along with other counter@@ culture ide@@ ologists like Timothy Lear@@ y , Gary Sn@@ y@@ der , and Alan Watts , G@@ ins@@ berg hoped to incorporate B@@ hak@@ tiv@@ ed@@ anta Sw@@ ami and his chanting into the hip@@ pie movement , and agreed to take part in the Man@@ tra @-@ Rock Dance concert and to introduce the sw@@ ami to the Ha@@ ight @-@ Ash@@ bury hip@@ pie community . : G@@ ins@@ berg :
so what do you think of Sw@@ ami B@@ hak@@ tiv@@ ed@@ anta pleading for the acceptance of Krishna in every direction ?
Sn@@ y@@ der : why , it &apos;s a lovely positive thing to say Krishna .
it &apos;s a beautiful mythology and it &apos;s a beautiful practice .
Lear@@ y : should be encouraged .
G@@ ins@@ berg : he feels it &apos;s the one uniting thing .
he feels a monopolistic unitary thing about it .
Watts : I &apos;ll tell you why I think he feels it .
the man@@ tr@@ as , the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association ...
&#91; W &#93; hen somebody comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn &apos;t got any of &#91; horrible &#93; associations in our minds , all the words are new , all the rites are new , and yet , somehow it has feeling in it , and we can get with that , you see , and we can dig that !
on January 17 , 1967 , G@@ ins@@ berg helped plan and organize a reception for B@@ hak@@ tiv@@ ed@@ anta Sw@@ ami at San Francisco International Airport , where fifty to a hundred hip@@ pies greeted the Sw@@ ami , chanting Hare Krishna in the airport lounge with flowers in hands .
to further support and promote B@@ hak@@ ti@@ ven@@ data Sw@@ ami &apos;s message and chanting in San Francisco , Allen G@@ ins@@ berg agreed to attend the Man@@ tra @-@ Rock Dance , a musical event 1967 held at the A@@ val@@ on Ball@@ room by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple .
it featured some leading rock bands of the time :
big Brother and the Holding Company with Jan@@ is Jo@@ plin , the Gr@@ at@@ eful Dead , and Mo@@ by G@@ rape , who performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder B@@ hak@@ tiv@@ ed@@ anta Sw@@ ami and donated proceeds to the Krishna temple .
G@@ ins@@ berg introduced B@@ hak@@ tiv@@ ed@@ anta Sw@@ ami to some three thousand hip@@ pies in the audience and led the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra .
music and chanting were both important parts of G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s live delivery during poetry readings .
he often accompanied himself on a harmon@@ ium , and was often accompanied by a guit@@ arist .
it is believed that the Hindi and Buddhist poet Nag@@ ar@@ jun@@ a had introduced G@@ ins@@ berg to the harmon@@ ium in Ban@@ ar@@ as .
according to Malay Roy Chou@@ dhury , G@@ ins@@ berg refined his practice while learning from his relatives , including his cousin Sav@@ it@@ ri Ban@@ er@@ jee .
when G@@ ins@@ berg asked if he could sing a song in praise of Lord Krishna on William F. Buck@@ ley , Jr . &apos; S TV show &quot; F@@ iring Line &quot; on September 3 , 1968 , Buck@@ ley acceded and the poet chan@@ ted slowly as he played dol@@ efully on a harmon@@ ium .
according to Richard Brook@@ h@@ iser , an associate of Buck@@ ley &apos;s , the host commented that it was &quot; the most un@@ har@@ ried Krishna I &apos;ve ever heard . &quot; at the 1967 Human Be @-@ In in San Francisco &apos;s Golden Gate Park , the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago , and the 1970 Black Pan@@ ther rally at Yale campus Allen chan@@ ted &quot; O@@ m &quot; repeatedly over a sound system for hours on end .
G@@ ins@@ berg further brought man@@ tr@@ as into the world of rock and roll when he recited the Heart Su@@ tra in the song &quot; G@@ het@@ to Def@@ end@@ ant . &quot; the song appears on the 1982 album Combat Rock by British first wave punk band The Cl@@ ash .
G@@ ins@@ berg came in touch with the Hun@@ gr@@ y@@ alist poets of Bengal , especially Malay Roy Chou@@ dhury , who introduced G@@ ins@@ berg to the three fishes with one head of Indian emperor Jal@@ al@@ uddin Mohammad Ak@@ bar .
the three fishes symbol@@ ised coexistence of all thought , philosophy and religion .
in spite of G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s attraction to Eastern religions , the journalist Jane Kra@@ mer argues that he , like Whitman , adhered to an &quot; American brand of mys@@ ticism &quot; that was &quot; rooted in humanism and in a romantic and visionary ideal of harmony among men . &quot;

in 1960 , he was treated for a tropical disease , and it is speculated that he contracted hepatitis from an un@@ sterilized needle administered by a doctor , which played a role in his death 37 years later .
G@@ ins@@ berg was a lifelong smoker , and though he tried to quit for health and religious reasons , his busy schedule in later life made it difficult , and he always returned to smoking .
in the 1970s , G@@ ins@@ berg suffered two minor strokes which were first diagnosed as Bell &apos;s palsy , which gave him significant paralysis and stroke @-@ like dro@@ oping of the muscles in one side of his face .
later in life , he also suffered constant minor ailments such as high blood pressure .
many of these symptoms were related to stress , but he never slowed down his schedule .

G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s willingness to talk about taboo subjects made him a controversial figure during the conservative 1950s , and a significant figure in the 1960s .
in the mid @-@ 1950s , no reputable publishing company would even consider publishing &quot; How@@ l . &quot; at the time , such &quot; sex talk &quot; employed in &quot; How@@ l &quot; was considered by some to be vulgar or even a form of pornography , and could be prosecuted under law .
G@@ ins@@ berg used phrases such as &quot; cock@@ sucker , &quot; &quot; fucked in the ass , &quot; and &quot; c@@ unt &quot; as part of the poem &apos;s depiction of different aspects of American culture .
numerous books that discussed sex were banned at the time , including &quot; Lady Ch@@ atter@@ ley &apos;s L@@ over &quot; .
the sex that G@@ ins@@ berg described did not portray the sex between heterosexual married couples , or even longtime lovers .
instead , G@@ ins@@ berg portrayed casual sex .
for example , in &quot; How@@ l , &quot; G@@ ins@@ berg praises the man &quot; who swee@@ tened the snat@@ ches of a million girls . &quot; G@@ ins@@ berg used grit@@ ty descriptions and explicit sexual language , pointing out the man &quot; who loun@@ ged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup . &quot; in his poetry , G@@ ins@@ berg also discussed the then @-@ taboo topic of homosexuality .
the explicit sexual language that filled &quot; How@@ l &quot; eventually led to an important trial on First Amendment issues .
G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s publisher was brought up on charges for publishing pornography , and the outcome led to a judge going on record dismissing charges , because the poem carried &quot; re@@ deeming social importance , &quot; thus setting an important legal precedent .
G@@ ins@@ berg continued to bro@@ ach controversial subjects throughout the 1970s , 1980s , and 1990s .
from 1970 @-@ 1996 , G@@ ins@@ berg had a long @-@ term affiliation with PEN American Center with efforts to defend free expression .
when explaining how he approached controversial topics , he often pointed to Herbert Hun@@ c@@ ke : he said that when he first got to know Hun@@ c@@ ke in the 1940s , G@@ ins@@ berg saw that he was sick from his heroin addiction , but at the time heroin was a taboo subject and Hun@@ c@@ ke was left with nowhere to go for help .

G@@ ins@@ berg was a signer of the anti @-@ war manifesto &quot; A Call to Resi@@ st Il@@ legitimate Authority , &quot; circulated among draft resist@@ ors in 1967 by members of the radical intellectual collective RES@@ IST .
other sign@@ ers and RES@@ IST members included Mitchell Good@@ man , Henry Bra@@ un , Denise L@@ ever@@ tov , No@@ am Ch@@ om@@ sky , William Slo@@ ane Coff@@ in , D@@ wi@@ ght Mac@@ don@@ ald , Robert Low@@ ell , and Norman Mail@@ er .
in 1968 , G@@ ins@@ berg signed the &quot; Writers and Ed@@ itors War Tax Pro@@ test &quot; pledge , v@@ owing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War , and later became a sponsor of the War Tax Resistance project , which practiced and advocated tax resistance as a form of anti @-@ war protest .
he was present the night of the Tom@@ p@@ kins Square Park riot in 1988 and provided an eyewitness account to &quot; The New York Times &quot; .

Allen G@@ ins@@ berg called attention to the suffering of victims during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 .
he wrote his legendary 152 @-@ line poem , &quot; September on Jess@@ ore Road &quot; , after visiting refugee camps and witnessing the plight of millions fleeing the violence .
millions of daughters walk in the mud Mil@@ lions of children wash in the flood A Million girls vomit &amp; groan Mil@@ lions of families hopeless alone G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s poem also serves as an indictment of the United States : where are the helicopters of U.S. AID ?
smuggling dope in Bangkok &apos;s green shade .
where is America &apos;s Air Force of Light ?
bombing North Laos all day and all night ?
out of the poem , he made a song that was performed by Bob D@@ ylan , other musicians and G@@ ins@@ berg himself .
the last few lines of the poem read : millions of babies in pain Mil@@ lions of mothers in rain Mil@@ lions of brothers in woe Mil@@ lions of children nowhere to go

G@@ ins@@ berg talked openly about his connections with communism and his admiration for past communist heroes and the labor movement at a time when the Red S@@ care and McCar@@ thy@@ ism were still raging .
he admired Fidel Castro and many other quasi @-@ Marxist figures from the 20th century .
in &quot; America &quot; , G@@ ins@@ berg writes : &quot; America , I used to be a communist when I was a kid I &apos;m not sorry . &quot; bi@@ ographer Jonah Ras@@ kin has claimed that , despite his often stark opposition to communist orthodoxy , G@@ ins@@ berg held &quot; his own idiosyn@@ cratic version of communism . &quot; on the other hand , when Donald Man@@ es , a New York City politician , publicly accused G@@ ins@@ berg of being a member of the Communist Party , G@@ ins@@ berg objected :
&quot; I am not , as a matter of fact , a member of the Communist party , nor am I dedicated to the overthrow of the U.S. government or any government by violence .. I must say that I see little difference between the armed and violent governments both Communist and Capit@@ alist that I have observed . &quot; G@@ ins@@ berg travelled to several communist countries to promote free speech .
he claimed that communist countries , such as China , welcomed him , because they thought he was an enemy of capitalism , but often turned against him when they saw him as a troubl@@ emaker .
for example , in 1965 G@@ ins@@ berg was deported from Cuba for publicly protesting the persecution of homosexuals and referring to Che Gu@@ ev@@ ara as &quot; cute . &quot; the Cubans sent him to Czechoslovakia , where one week after being named the &quot; Kr@@ á@@ l maj@@ á@@ le@@ su &quot; , G@@ ins@@ berg was arrested for alleged drug use and public drunk@@ enness , and the security agency St@@ B confiscated several of his writings , which they considered to be le@@ w@@ d and morally dangerous .
G@@ ins@@ berg was then deported from Czechoslovakia on May 7 , 1965 by order of the St@@ B .
Vá@@ cl@@ av Hav@@ el points to G@@ ins@@ berg as an important inspiration .
</p>
<p>
one contribution that is often considered his most significant and most controversial was his openness about homosexuality .
G@@ ins@@ berg was an early proponent of freedom for gay people .
in 1943 , he discovered within himself &quot; mountains of homosexuality . &quot; he expressed this desire openly and graphically in his poetry .
he also struck a note for gay marriage by listing Peter Or@@ lov@@ sky , his lifelong companion , as his spouse in his Who &apos;s Who entry .
subsequent gay writers saw his frank talk about homosexuality as an opening to speak more openly and honestly about something often before only hinted at or spoken of in metaphor .
in writing about sexuality in graphic detail and in his frequent use of language seen as indecent , he challenged - and ultimately changed - obscen@@ ity laws .
he was a staunch supporter of others whose expression challenged obscen@@ ity laws .
</p>
<p>
G@@ ins@@ berg talked often about drug use .
he organized the New York City chapter of Le@@ Mar .
throughout the 1960s he took an active role in the dem@@ y@@ sti@@ fication of L@@ SD , and , with Timothy Lear@@ y , worked to promote its common use .
he remained for many decades an advocate of marijuana legalization , and , at the same time , warned his audiences against the hazards of tobacco in his &quot; Put Down Your C@@ ig@@ a@@ rette Ra@@ g : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t Smo@@ ke Don &apos;t Smo@@ ke Nico@@ tine Nico@@ tine No / No don &apos;t smoke the official D@@ ope Smo@@ ke D@@ ope D@@ ope . &quot;

on the latter &apos;s book &quot; The Politics of Her@@ o@@ in in Southeast Asia &quot; , which claimed that the CIA was knowingly involved in the production of heroin in the Golden Triangle of Burma , Thailand , and Laos .
in addition to working with Mc@@ Co@@ y , G@@ ins@@ berg personally confronted Richard Helms , the director of the CIA in the 1970s , about the matter , but Helms denied that the CIA had anything to do with selling illegal drugs .
Allen wrote many essays and articles , researching and compiling evidence of the CIA &apos;s alleged involvement in drug trafficking , but it would take 10 years , and the publication of Mc@@ Co@@ y &apos;s book in 1972 , before anyone took him seriously .
in 1978 G@@ ins@@ berg received a note from the chief editor of &quot; The New York Times &quot; , apologizing for not taking his allegations seriously so many years previous .
the political subject is dealt with in his song / poem &quot; CIA D@@ ope caly@@ p@@ so . &quot; the United States Department of State responded to Mc@@ Co@@ y &apos;s initial allegations stating that they were &quot; unable to find any evidence to substantiate them , much less proof . &quot; subsequent investigations by the Inspector General of the CIA , United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs , and United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities , a.@@ k.@@ a. the Church Committee , also found the charges to be unsubstantiated .
</p>
<p>
most of G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s very early poetry was written in formal rhyme and meter like that of his father , and of his idol William Blake .
his admiration for the writing of Jack Ker@@ ou@@ ac inspired him to take poetry more seriously .
in 1955 , upon the advice of a psychiatrist , G@@ ins@@ berg dropped out of the working world to devote his entire life to poetry .
soon after , he wrote &quot; How@@ l , &quot; the poem that brought him and his Be@@ at Generation contemporaries to national attention and allowed him to live as a professional poet for the rest of his life .
later in life , G@@ ins@@ berg entered academia , teaching poetry as Distinguished Professor of English at Brooklyn College from 1986 until his death .
</p>
<p>
G@@ ins@@ berg claimed throughout his life that his biggest inspiration was Ker@@ ou@@ ac &apos;s concept of &quot; spontaneous prose . &quot; he believed literature should come from the soul without conscious restrictions .
G@@ ins@@ berg was much more prone to revise than Ker@@ ou@@ ac .
for example , when Ker@@ ou@@ ac saw the first draft of &quot; How@@ l &quot; he disliked the fact that G@@ ins@@ berg had made editorial changes in pencil .
Ker@@ ou@@ ac only wrote out his concepts of Spon@@ tan@@ eous Pro@@ se at G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s insistence because G@@ ins@@ berg wanted to learn how to apply the technique to his poetry .
the inspiration for &quot; How@@ l &quot; was G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s friend , Carl Solomon , and &quot; How@@ l &quot; is dedicated to him .
Solomon was a D@@ ada and Sur@@ realism enthusi@@ ast who suffered bouts of clinical depression .
Solomon wanted to commit suicide , but he thought a form of suicide appropriate to d@@ ad@@ a@@ ism would be to go to a mental institution and demand a lob@@ otomy .
the institution refused , giving him many forms of therapy , including electro@@ shock therapy .
much of the final section of the first part of &quot; How@@ l &quot; is a description of this .
G@@ ins@@ berg used Solomon as an example of all those ground down by the machine of &quot; M@@ olo@@ ch . &quot; M@@ olo@@ ch , to whom the second section is addressed , is a Lev@@ antine god to whom children were sacrificed .
G@@ ins@@ berg may have gotten the name from the Kenneth R@@ ex@@ ro@@ th poem &quot; Thou S@@ halt Not K@@ ill , &quot; a poem about the death of one of G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s heroes , D@@ ylan Thomas .
M@@ olo@@ ch is mentioned a few times in the Tor@@ ah and references to G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s Jewish background are frequent in his work .
G@@ ins@@ berg said the image of M@@ olo@@ ch was inspired by pe@@ y@@ ote visions he had of the Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco which appeared to him as a skull ; he took it as a symbol of the city .
G@@ ins@@ berg later acknowledged in various publications and interviews that behind the visions of the Francis Drake Hotel were memories of the M@@ olo@@ ch of F@@ ritz Lang &apos;s film &quot; Metro@@ polis &quot; and of the wood@@ cut novels of Ly@@ nd Ward .
M@@ olo@@ ch has subsequently been interpreted as any system of control , including the con@@ form@@ ist society of post @-@ World War II America , focused on material gain , which G@@ ins@@ berg frequently blamed for the destruction of all those outside of societal norms .
he also made sure to emphasize that M@@ olo@@ ch is a part of humanity in multiple aspects , in that the decision to &quot; defy &quot; socially created systems of control - and therefore go against M@@ olo@@ ch - is a form of self @-@ destruction .
many of the characters G@@ ins@@ berg references in &quot; How@@ l , &quot; such as Ne@@ al Cass@@ ady and Herbert Hun@@ c@@ ke , destroyed themselves through excessive substance abuse or a generally wild lifestyle .
the personal aspects of &quot; How@@ l &quot; are perhaps as important as the political aspects .
Carl Solomon , the prime example of a &quot; best mind &quot; destroyed by defying society , is associated with G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s schizophren@@ ic mother : the line &quot; with mother finally fucked &quot; comes after a long section about Carl Solomon , and in Part III , G@@ ins@@ berg says :
&quot; I &apos;m with you in Rock@@ land where you imitate the shade of my mother . &quot; G@@ ins@@ berg later admitted that the drive to write &quot; How@@ l &quot; was fueled by sympathy for his ailing mother , an issue which he was not yet ready to deal with directly .
he dealt with it directly with 1959 &apos;s &quot; Kad@@ dish , &quot; which had its first public reading at a Catholic Worker Friday Night meeting , possibly due to its associations with Thomas Mer@@ ton .
</p>
<p>
G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s poetry was strongly influenced by Modern@@ ism , Roman@@ ticism , the beat and cad@@ ence of jazz , and his Kag@@ yu Buddhist practice and Jewish background .
he considered himself to have inherited the visionary poetic mantle handed down from the English poet and artist William Blake , the American poet Walt Whitman and the Spanish poet Federico García Lor@@ ca .
the power of G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s verse , its searching , probing focus , its long and lil@@ ting lines , as well as its New World exuber@@ ance , all echo the continuity of inspiration that he claimed .
he corresponded with William Carlos Williams , who was then in the middle of writing his epic poem &quot; Pater@@ son &quot; about the industrial city near his home .
after attending a reading by Williams , G@@ ins@@ berg sent the older poet several of his poems and wrote an introductory letter .
most of these early poems were rhy@@ med and metered and included archaic pronoun@@ s like &quot; thee . &quot; Williams disliked the poems and told G@@ ins@@ berg , &quot; In this mode perfection is basic , and these poems are not perfect . &quot; though he disliked these early poems , Williams loved the exuber@@ ance in G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s letter .
he included the letter in a later part of &quot; Pater@@ son &quot; .
he encouraged G@@ ins@@ berg not to emulate the old masters , but to speak with his own voice and the voice of the common American .
from Williams , G@@ ins@@ berg learned to focus on strong visual images , in line with Williams &apos; own motto &quot; No ideas but in things . &quot; studying Williams &apos; style led to a tremendous shift from the early form@@ alist work to a loose , colloqu@@ ial free verse style .
early breakthrough poems include &quot; B@@ rick@@ layer &apos;s Lun@@ ch Hour &quot; and &quot; Dream Record &quot; .
Carl Solomon introduced G@@ ins@@ berg to the work of Anton@@ in Ar@@ ta@@ ud , and Jean Gen@@ et .
Philip Lam@@ anti@@ a introduced him to other Sur@@ re@@ alists and Sur@@ realism continued to be an influence .
G@@ ins@@ berg claimed that the an@@ aphor@@ ic repetition of &quot; How@@ l &quot; and other poems was inspired by Christopher Smart in such poems as &quot; Ju@@ bil@@ ate Agn@@ o &quot; .
G@@ ins@@ berg also claimed other more traditional influences , such as :
Franz Kaf@@ ka , Herman Mel@@ ville , F@@ y@@ odor Do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky , Edgar Allan Po@@ e , and Emily Dick@@ inson .
G@@ ins@@ berg also made an intense study of ha@@ ik@@ u and the paintings of Paul Cé@@ z@@ anne , from which he adapted a concept important to his work , which he called the &quot; E@@ ye@@ ball K@@ ick &quot; .
he noticed in viewing Cé@@ z@@ anne &apos;s paintings that when the eye moved from one color to a contrasting color , the eye would spasm , or &quot; kick . &quot; likewise , he discovered that the contrast of two seeming opposites was a common feature in ha@@ ik@@ u .
the example G@@ ins@@ berg most often used was &quot; hydrogen ju@@ ke@@ box &quot; .
another example is G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s observation on Bob D@@ ylan during D@@ ylan &apos;s hectic and intense 1966 electric @-@ guitar tour , fuelled by a cocktail of amphetamines , opiates , alcohol , and psych@@ ed@@ el@@ ics , as a &quot; D@@ ex@@ ed@@ rine C@@ low@@ n &quot; .
the phrases &quot; eyeball kick &quot; and &quot; hydrogen ju@@ ke@@ box &quot; both show up in &quot; How@@ l , &quot; as well as a direct quote from Cé@@ z@@ anne : &quot; P@@ ater Om@@ ni@@ poten@@ s A@@ eter@@ na De@@ us . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Allen G@@ ins@@ berg also found inspiration in music .
he frequently included music in his poetry , invariably composing his tunes on an old Indian harmon@@ ium , which he often played during his readings .
he wrote and recorded music to accompany William Blake &apos;s &quot; Son@@ gs of Inno@@ cence &quot; and &quot; Son@@ gs of Experience &quot; .
he also recorded a handful of other albums .
to create music for &quot; How@@ l &quot; and &quot; W@@ ich@@ ita Vor@@ tex Su@@ tra &quot; he worked with the minimalist composer , Philip Glass .
G@@ ins@@ berg worked with , drew inspiration from , and inspired artists such as Bob D@@ ylan , The Cl@@ ash , Pat@@ ti Smith , Phil O@@ chs , and The Fu@@ gs .
he worked with D@@ ylan on various projects and maintained a friendship with him over many years .
in 1996 , he also recorded a song co@@ written with Paul McCar@@ tney and Philip Glass , &quot; The Bal@@ lad of the Sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons , &quot; which reached number 8 on the Tri@@ ple J Hot@@ test 100 for that year .
</p>
<p>
from the study of his idols and mentors and the inspiration of his friends - not to mention his own experiments - G@@ ins@@ berg developed an individu@@ alistic style that &apos;s easily identified as G@@ ins@@ ber@@ gian .
G@@ ins@@ berg stated that Whitman &apos;s long line was a dynamic technique few other poets had ventured to develop further , and Whitman is also often compared to G@@ ins@@ berg because their poetry sexu@@ alized aspects of the male form .
many of G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s early long line experiments contain some sort of an@@ aphor@@ a , repetition of a &quot; fixed base &quot; and this has become a recognizable feature of G@@ ins@@ berg &apos;s style .
he said later this was a crutch because he lacked confidence ; he did not yet trust &quot; free flight . &quot; in the 1960s , after employing it in some sections of &quot; Kad@@ dish &quot; he , for the most part , abandoned the an@@ aphor@@ ic form .
several of his earlier experiments with methods for formatting poems as a whole became regular aspects of his style in later poems .
in the original draft of &quot; How@@ l , &quot; each line is in a &quot; stepped tri@@ adic &quot; format reminiscent of William Carlos Williams .
however , he abandoned the &quot; stepped tri@@ adic &quot; when he developed his long line although the stepped lines showed up later , most significantly in the travel@@ o@@ gues of &quot; The Fall of America . &quot; &quot; howl &quot; and &quot; Kad@@ dish , &quot; arguably his two most important poems , are both organized as an inverted pyramid , with larger sections leading to smaller sections .
in &quot; America &quot; , he also experimented with a mix of longer and shorter lines .
in &quot; How@@ l &quot; and in his other poetry , G@@ ins@@ berg drew inspiration from the epic , free verse style of the 19th @-@ century American poet Walt Whitman .
both wrote passionately about the promise of American democracy , the central importance of erotic experience , and the spiritual quest for the truth of everyday existence .

Anatol@@ y Y@@ ev@@ gen@@ y@@ evich Kar@@ po@@ v is a Russian chess grand@@ master and former World Champion .
he was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Gar@@ ry Kas@@ par@@ ov .
he played three matches against Kas@@ par@@ ov for the title from 1986 to 1990 , before becoming F@@ IDE World Champion once again after Kas@@ par@@ ov broke away from F@@ IDE in 1993 .
he held the title until 1999 , when he resigned his title in protest against F@@ IDE &apos;s new world championship rules .
for his decades @-@ long standing among the world &apos;s elite , many consider Kar@@ po@@ v one of the greatest players in history .
his tournament successes include over 160 first @-@ place finishes .
he had a peak El@@ o rating of 27@@ 80 , and his 102 total months at world number one is the third longest of all time , behind Magn@@ us Carl@@ sen and Gar@@ ry Kas@@ par@@ ov , since the inception of the F@@ IDE ranking list in 1970 .
</p>
<p>
Kar@@ po@@ v was born on May 23 , 1951 , in Z@@ lat@@ ou@@ st in the Ur@@ als region of the former Soviet Union , and learned to play chess at the age of 4 .
his early rise in chess was swift , as he became a Candidate Master by age 11 .
at 12 , he was accepted into Mikhail Bot@@ vin@@ nik &apos;s prestigious chess school , though Bot@@ vin@@ nik made the following remark about the young Kar@@ po@@ v :
&quot; the boy does not have a clue about chess , and there &apos;s no future at all for him in this profession . &quot; Kar@@ po@@ v acknowledged that his understanding of chess theory was very confused at that time , and later wrote that the homework Bot@@ vin@@ nik assigned greatly helped him , since it required that he consult chess books and work diligently .
Kar@@ po@@ v improved so quickly under Bot@@ vin@@ nik &apos;s tutel@@ age that he became the youngest Soviet National Master in history at fifteen in 1966 ; this tied the record established by Boris S@@ pass@@ ky in 1952 .
</p>
<p>
Kar@@ po@@ v finished first in his first international tournament in T@@ ř@@ in@@ ec several months later , ahead of Viktor Ku@@ pre@@ ic@@ hi@@ k .
in 1967 , he won the annual European Junior Championship at G@@ ron@@ ingen .
Kar@@ po@@ v won a gold medal for academic excellence in high school , and entered Moscow State University in 1968 to study mathematics .
he later transferred to Len@@ ingrad State University , eventually graduating from there in economics .
one reason for the transfer was to be closer to his coach , grand@@ master Sem@@ yon Fur@@ man , who lived in Len@@ ingrad .
in his writings , Kar@@ po@@ v credits Fur@@ man as a major influence on his development as a world @-@ class player .
in 1969 , Kar@@ po@@ v became the first Soviet player since S@@ pass@@ ky to win the World Junior Ch@@ ess Championship , scoring an un@@ defeated 10 / 11 in the finals at Stockholm .
in 1970 , he tied for fourth place at an international tournament in Caracas , Venezuela , and was awarded the grand@@ master title .
</p>
<p>
he won the 1971 Ale@@ kh@@ ine Memorial in Moscow , ahead of a star @-@ studded field , for his first significant adult victory .
his El@@ o rating shot from 25@@ 40 in 1971 to 26@@ 60 in 1973 , when he shared second in the USSR Ch@@ ess Championship , and finished equal first with Viktor Kor@@ ch@@ no@@ i in the Len@@ ingrad Inter@@ zonal Tour@@ nament .
the latter success qualified him for the 1974 Candidates Mat@@ ches , which would determine the challenger to the re@@ igning world champion , Bobby Fischer .
</p>
<p>
Kar@@ po@@ v defeated L@@ ev P@@ olu@@ ga@@ ev@@ sky by the score of + 3 = 5 in the first Candidates &apos; match , earning the right to face former champion Boris S@@ pass@@ ky in the semi@@ final round .
Kar@@ po@@ v was on record saying that he believed S@@ pass@@ ky would easily beat him and win the Candidates &apos; cycle to face Fischer , and that he would win the following Candidates &apos; cycle in 1977 .
S@@ pass@@ ky won the first game as Black in good style , but tenacious , aggressive play from Kar@@ po@@ v secured him overall victory by + 4 − 1 = 6 .
the Candidates &apos; final was played in Moscow with Kor@@ ch@@ no@@ i .
Kar@@ po@@ v took an early lead , winning the second game against the Sic@@ ilian Dragon , then scoring another victory in the sixth game .
following ten consecutive draws , Kor@@ ch@@ no@@ i threw away a winning position in the seventeenth game to give Kar@@ po@@ v a 3 @-@ 0 lead .
in game 19 , Kor@@ ch@@ no@@ i succeeded in winning a long end@@ game , then not@@ ched a speedy victory after a blunder by Kar@@ po@@ v two games later .
three more draws , the last agreed by Kar@@ po@@ v in a clearly better position , closed the match , as he thus prevailed + 3 − 2 = 19 , moving on to challenge Fischer for the world title .
</p>
<p>
though a world championship match between Kar@@ po@@ v and Fischer was highly anticipated , those hopes were never realised .
Fischer not only insisted that the match be the first to ten wins , but also that the champion retain the crown if the score was tied 9 @-@ 9 .
fide , the International Ch@@ ess Federation , refused to allow this proviso , and after Fischer &apos;s resignation of the championship on June 27 , 1975 , F@@ IDE declared that Fischer forfeited his crown .
Kar@@ po@@ v later attempted to set up another match with Fischer , but the negotiations fell through .
this thrust the young Kar@@ po@@ v into the role of World Champion without having faced the re@@ igning champion .
Gar@@ ry Kas@@ par@@ ov argued that Kar@@ po@@ v would have had good chances , because he had beaten S@@ pass@@ ky convincingly and was a new breed of tough professional , and indeed had higher quality games , while Fischer had been inactive for three years .
S@@ pass@@ ky thought that Fischer would have won in 1975 but Kar@@ po@@ v would have qualified again and beaten Fischer in 1978 .
</p>
<p>
determined to prove himself a legitimate champion , Kar@@ po@@ v participated in nearly every major tournament for the next ten years .
he convincingly won the very strong Milan tournament in 1975 , and captured his first of three Soviet titles in 1976 .
he created a phenomenal streak of tournament wins against the strongest players in the world .
Kar@@ po@@ v held the record for most consecutive tournament victories until it was shattered by Gar@@ ry Kas@@ par@@ ov .
as a result , most chess professionals soon agreed that Kar@@ po@@ v was a legitimate world champion .
in 1978 , Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s first title defence was against Kor@@ ch@@ no@@ i , the opponent he had defeated in the 1973 @-@ 75 Candidates &apos; cycle ; the match was played at B@@ agu@@ io , Philippines , with the winner needing six victories .
as in 1974 , Kar@@ po@@ v took an early lead , winning the eighth game after seven draws to open the match .
when the score was + 5 − 2 = 20 in Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s favour , Kor@@ ch@@ no@@ i staged a comeback , and won three of the next four games to draw level with Kar@@ po@@ v .
Kar@@ po@@ v then won the very next game to retain the title .
three years later Kor@@ ch@@ no@@ i re@@ emerged as the Candidates &apos; winner against German fin@@ alist Robert Hü@@ b@@ ner to challenge Kar@@ po@@ v in Mer@@ ano , Italy .
Kar@@ po@@ v hand@@ ily won this match , 11 @-@ 7 , in what is remembered as the &quot; Mass@@ acre in Mer@@ ano . &quot; Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s tournament career reached a peak at the Montreal &quot; Tour@@ nament of Stars &quot; tournament in 1979 , where he finished joint first with Mikhail Tal ahead of a field of strong grand@@ masters completed by Jan Tim@@ man , L@@ j@@ ub@@ om@@ ir Lju@@ bo@@ j@@ ević , Boris S@@ pass@@ ky , V@@ las@@ tim@@ il Hor@@ t , La@@ jos Por@@ tis@@ ch , Hü@@ b@@ ner , B@@ ent Larsen and Lub@@ om@@ ir K@@ aval@@ ek .
he dominated Las Pal@@ mas 1977 with 13 ½ / 15 .
he also won the prestigious Bu@@ go@@ j@@ no tournament in 1978 , 1980 and 1986 , the Lin@@ ares tournament in 1981 and 1994 , the Til@@ burg tournament in 1977 , 1979 , 1980 , 1982 , and 1983 , and the Soviet Championship in 1976 , 1983 , and 1988 .
Kar@@ po@@ v represented the Soviet Union at six Ch@@ ess Olympi@@ ads , in all of which the USSR won the team gold medal .
he played first reserve at Skopje 1972 , winning the board prize with 13 / 15 .
at Nice 1974 , he advanced to board one and again won the board prize with 12 / 14 .
at La Val@@ let@@ ta 1980 , he was again board one and scored 9 / 12 .
at Lu@@ cer@@ ne 1982 , he scored 6 ½ / 8 on board one .
at Dubai 1986 , he scored 6 / 9 on board two .
his last was Thessaloniki 1988 , where on board two he scored 8 / 10 .
in Olympiad play , Kar@@ po@@ v lost only two games out of 68 played .
to illustrate Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s dominance over his peers as champion , his score was + 11 − 2 = 20 versus S@@ pass@@ ky , + 5 = 12 versus Robert Hü@@ b@@ ner , + 6 − 1 = 16 versus Ul@@ f Ander@@ sson , + 3 − 1 = 10 versus Vasi@@ ly S@@ mys@@ lov , + 1 = 16 versus Mikhail Tal , and + 10 − 2 = 13 versus Lju@@ bo@@ j@@ ević .
Kar@@ po@@ v had cemented his position as the world &apos;s best player and world champion by the time Gar@@ ry Kas@@ par@@ ov arrived on the scene .
in their first match , the World Ch@@ ess Championship 1984 in Moscow , the first player to win six games would win the match .
Kar@@ po@@ v built a 4 @-@ 0 lead after nine games .
the next 17 games were drawn , setting a record for world title matches , and it took Kar@@ po@@ v until game 27 to gain his fifth win .
in game 31 , Kar@@ po@@ v had a winning position but failed to take advantage and settled for a draw .
he lost the next game , after which 14 more draws ensued .
Kar@@ po@@ v held a solidly winning position in Game 41 , but again bl@@ undered and had to settle for a draw .
after Kas@@ par@@ ov won games 47 and 48 , F@@ IDE President Flor@@ en@@ cio Cam@@ pom@@ anes unilaterally terminated the match , citing the players &apos; health .
the match had lasted an unprecedented five months , with five wins for Kar@@ po@@ v , three for Kas@@ par@@ ov , and 40 draws .
a re@@ match was set for later in 1985 , also in Moscow .
the events of the so @-@ called Marathon Match forced F@@ IDE to return to the previous format , with a match limited to 24 games .
Kar@@ po@@ v needed to win the final game to draw the match and retain his title , but lost , surrendering the title to his opponent .
the final score was 13 @-@ 11 in favour of Kas@@ par@@ ov .
</p>
<p>
Kar@@ po@@ v remained a formidable opponent until the early 1990s .
he fought Kas@@ par@@ ov in three more world championship matches in 1986 , 1987 , and 1990 .
all three matches were extremely close : the scores were 11 ½ -@@ 12 ½ , 12 @-@ 12 , and 11 ½ -@@ 12 ½ .
in all three matches , Kar@@ po@@ v had winning chances up to the very last games .
in particular , the 1987 Sev@@ ille match featured an astonishing blunder by Kas@@ par@@ ov in the 23rd game .
in the final game , needing only a draw to win the title , Kar@@ po@@ v cracked under time pressure at the end of the first session of play , missed a variation leading to an almost forced draw , and allowed Kas@@ par@@ ov to adjourn the game with an extra pawn .
after a further mistake in the second session , Kar@@ po@@ v was slowly ground down and resigned on move 64 , ending the match and allowing Kas@@ par@@ ov to keep the title .
in their five world championship matches , Kar@@ po@@ v scored 19 wins , 21 losses , and 104 draws in 144 games .
Kar@@ po@@ v is on record saying that if he had had the opportunity to play Fischer for the crown in his twenties , he could have been a much better player as a result .
</p>
<p>
in 1992 , Kar@@ po@@ v lost a Candidates Match against Nigel Short .
but in 1993 , Kar@@ po@@ v re@@ acquired the F@@ IDE World Champion title when Kas@@ par@@ ov and Short split from F@@ IDE .
Kar@@ po@@ v defeated Tim@@ man - the loser of the Candidates &apos; final against Short .
the next major meeting of Kas@@ par@@ ov and Kar@@ po@@ v was the 1994 Lin@@ ares chess tournament .
the field , in eventual finishing order , was Kar@@ po@@ v , Kas@@ par@@ ov , Shi@@ rov , B@@ are@@ ev , K@@ ram@@ nik , Lau@@ tier , An@@ and , Kam@@ sky , Top@@ al@@ ov , Ivan@@ ch@@ uk , Gel@@ f@@ and , Il@@ les@@ cas , Ju@@ dit Pol@@ g@@ á@@ r , and Beli@@ avsky ; with an average El@@ o rating of 26@@ 85 , the highest ever at that time .
impressed by the strength of the tournament , Kas@@ par@@ ov had said several days before the tournament that the winner could rightly be called the world champion of tournaments .
perhaps spurred on by this comment , Kar@@ po@@ v played the best tournament of his life .
he was un@@ defeated and earned 11 points out of 13 , finishing 2 ½ points ahead of second @-@ place Kas@@ par@@ ov and Shi@@ rov .
many of his wins were spectacular .
this performance against the best players in the world put his El@@ o rating tournament performance at 29@@ 85 , the highest performance rating of any player in history up until 2009 , when Magn@@ us Carl@@ sen won the category XXI Pearl Spring chess tournament with a performance of 30@@ 02 .
chess st@@ atistician Jeff Son@@ as considers Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s Lin@@ ares performance the best tournament result in history .
Kar@@ po@@ v defended his F@@ IDE title against G@@ ata Kam@@ sky in 1996 .
in 1998 , F@@ IDE largely scrapped the old system of Candidates &apos; Mat@@ ches , instead having a large knock@@ out event in which a large number of players contested short matches against each other over just a few weeks .
in the first of these events , the F@@ IDE World Ch@@ ess Championship 1998 , champion Kar@@ po@@ v was see@@ ded straight into the final , defeating Vis@@ wan@@ athan An@@ and .
in the subsequent cycle , the format was changed , with the champion having to qualify .
Kar@@ po@@ v refused to defend his title , and ceased to be F@@ IDE World Champion after the F@@ IDE World Ch@@ ess Championship 1999 .
</p>
<p>
Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s outstanding classical tournament play has been seriously limited since 1997 , since he prefers to be more involved in Russian politics .
he had been a member of the Supreme Soviet Commission for Foreign Affairs and the President of the Soviet Peace Fund before the Soviet Union dissolved .
in addition , he had been involved in several disputes with F@@ IDE and became increasingly disillusioned with chess .
in the September 2009 F@@ IDE rating list , he dropped out of the world &apos;s Top 100 for the first time .
Kar@@ po@@ v usually limits his play to exhibition events , and has revamped his style to specialize in rapid chess .
in 2002 he won a match against Kas@@ par@@ ov , defeating him in a rapid time control match 2 ½ -1 ½ .
in 2006 , he tied for first with Kas@@ par@@ ov in a bl@@ itz tournament , ahead of Kor@@ ch@@ no@@ i and Ju@@ dit Pol@@ g@@ á@@ r .
Kar@@ po@@ v and Kas@@ par@@ ov played a mixed 12 @-@ game match from September 21 @-@ 24 , 2009 , in Valencia , Spain .
it consisted of four rapid and eight bl@@ itz games and took place exactly 25 years after the two players &apos; legendary encounter at the World Ch@@ ess Championship 1984 .
Kas@@ par@@ ov won the match 9 @-@ 3 .
Kar@@ po@@ v played a match against Yasser Sei@@ ra@@ wan in 2012 in St. Louis , Missouri , an important center of the North American chess scene , winning 8 @-@ 6 .
in November 2012 , he won the Cap d &apos;@@ Ag@@ de rapid tournament that bears his name , beating Vassi@@ ly Ivan@@ ch@@ uk in the final .
</p>
<p>
since 2005 , he has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia .
he has recently involved himself in several humanitarian causes , such as advocating the use of io@@ dised salt .
on December 17 , 2012 , Kar@@ po@@ v supported the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the US .
Kar@@ po@@ v expressed support of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation , and accused Europe of trying to demon@@ ize Putin .
</p>
<p>
in March 2010 Kar@@ po@@ v announced that he would be a candidate for the presidency of F@@ IDE .
the election took place in September 2010 at the 39th Ch@@ ess Olympiad .
in May a fund @-@ raising event took place in New York with the participation of his former rival Gar@@ ry Kas@@ par@@ ov and of Magn@@ us Carl@@ sen , both of whom supported his bid and campaigned for him .
also Nigel Short announced he supported Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s candidacy .
however , on September 29 , 2010 , Kir@@ san I@@ ly@@ um@@ z@@ hin@@ ov was re@@ elected as President of F@@ IDE , winning the election by 95 votes to 55 .
</p>
<p>
Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s &quot; boa constric@@ tor &quot; playing style is solidly positional , taking no risks but reacting mercil@@ essly to any tiny errors made by his opponents .
as a result , he is often compared to his idol , the famous José Raúl Cap@@ abl@@ anca , the third World Champion .
Kar@@ po@@ v himself describes his style as follows : let us say the game may be continued in two ways : one of them is a beautiful tactical blow that gives rise to variations that don &apos;t yield to precise calculations ; the other is clear positional pressure that leads to an end@@ game with microscopic chances of victory ....
I would choose &#91; the latter &#93; without thinking twice .
if the opponent offers keen play I don &apos;t object ; but in such cases I get less satisfaction , even if I win , than from a game conducted according to all the rules of strategy with its ruthless logic .
</p>

Kar@@ po@@ v &apos;s extensive stamp collection of Belgian phil@@ ately and Belgian Congo stamps and postal history covering mail from 17@@ 42 through 1980 was sold by David Fel@@ d@@ man &apos;s auction company between December 2011 and 2012 .
he is also known to have a large chess stamp and chess book collections .
his private chess library consists of over 9000 books .

Kar@@ po@@ v has authored or co @-@ authored several books , most of which have been translated into English .

<p>
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es , son of Philip@@ pus , of the dem@@ e Ky@@ da@@ then@@ ai@@ on , was a comic play@@ wright of ancient Athens .
eleven of his forty plays survive virtually complete .
these provide the most valuable examples of a genre of comic drama known as Old Com@@ edy and are used to define it , along with fragments from dozens of lost plays by Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es and his contemporaries .
also known as &quot; the Father of Com@@ edy &quot; and &quot; the Prince of Ancient Com@@ edy , &quot; Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es has been said to recreate the life of ancient Athens more convincingly than any other author .
his powers of ridicule were feared and acknowledged by influential contemporaries ;
Plato singled out Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; play &quot; The Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; as slander that contributed to the trial and subsequent condemning to death of Socrates , although other sati@@ rical play@@ w@@ rights had also car@@ ic@@ at@@ ured the philosopher .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; second play , &quot; The Babylon@@ ians &quot; , was denounced by Cle@@ on as a slander against the Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; polis &quot; .
it is possible that the case was argued in court , but details of the trial are not recorded and Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es car@@ ic@@ at@@ ured Cle@@ on mercil@@ essly in his subsequent plays , especially &quot; The K@@ nights &quot; , the first of many plays that he directed himself .
&quot; in my opinion , &quot; he says through that play &apos;s Ch@@ orus , &quot; the author @-@ director of come@@ dies has the hardest job of all . &quot;
</p>
<p>
less is known about Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es than about his plays .
in fact , his plays are the main source of information about him and his life .
it was conventional in Old Com@@ edy for the Ch@@ orus to speak on behalf of the author during an address called the &apos; par@@ ab@@ asis &apos; and thus some biographical facts can be found there .
however , these facts relate almost entirely to his career as a dramatist and the plays contain few clear and unambiguous clues about his personal beliefs or his private life .
he was a comic &quot; poet &quot; in an age when it was conventional for a poet to assume the role of &apos; teacher &apos; , and though this specifically referred to his training of the Ch@@ orus in rehearsal , it also covered his relationship with the audience as a commentator on significant issues .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es claimed to be writing for a clever and discerning audience , yet he also declared that &apos; other times &apos; would judge the audience according to its reception of his plays .
he sometimes boasts of his originality as a dramatist yet his plays consistently espouse opposition to radical new influences in Ath@@ en@@ ian society .
he car@@ ic@@ at@@ ured leading figures in the arts , in politics , and in philosophy / religion .
such car@@ ic@@ atures seem to imply that Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es was an old @-@ fashioned conservative , yet that view of him leads to contradictions .
it has been argued that Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es produced plays mainly to entertain the audience and to win prestigious competitions .
his plays were written for production at the great dramatic festivals of Athens , the Len@@ aia and City Di@@ ony@@ sia , where they were judged and awarded prizes in competition with the works of other comic dram@@ atists .
an elaborate series of lot@@ teries , designed to prevent prejudice and corruption , reduced the voting judges at the City Di@@ ony@@ sia to just five .
these judges probably reflected the mood of the audiences yet there is much uncertainty about the composition of those audiences .
the theatres were certainly huge , with seating for at least 10,000 at the Theatre of Di@@ ony@@ sus .
the day &apos;s program at the City Di@@ ony@@ sia for example was crowded , with three tragedies and a &apos; sat@@ yr &apos; play ahead of a comedy , but it is possible that many of the poorer citizens occupied the festival holiday with other pursuits .
the conservative views expressed in the plays might therefore reflect the attitudes of the dominant group in an un@@ representative audience .
the production process might also have influenced the views expressed in the plays .
throughout most of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; career , the Ch@@ orus was essential to a play &apos;s success and it was recruited and funded by a &quot; chor@@ eg@@ us &quot; , a wealthy citizen appointed to the task by one of the arch@@ ons .
a chor@@ eg@@ us could regard his personal expenditure on the Ch@@ orus as a civic duty and a public honour , but Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es showed in &quot; The K@@ nights &quot; that wealthy citizens might regard civic responsibilities as punishment imposed on them by dem@@ ago@@ gues and popul@@ ists like Cle@@ on .
thus the political conservatism of the plays may reflect the views of the wealthiest section of Ath@@ en@@ ian society , on whose generosity all dram@@ atists depended for putting on their plays .
when Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; first play &quot; The Ban@@ que@@ ters &quot; was produced , Athens was an ambitious , imperial power and the Pel@@ op@@ on@@ nesian War was only in its fourth year .
his plays often express pride in the achievement of the older generation yet they are not jing@@ o@@ istic , and they are sta@@ un@@ ch@@ ly opposed to the war with Spart@@ a .
the plays are particularly sc@@ athing in criticism of war profite@@ ers , among whom popul@@ ists such as Cle@@ on figure prominently .
by the time his last play was produced Athens had been defeated in war , its empire had been dismantled and it had undergone a transformation from being the political to the intellectual centre of Greece .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es was part of this transformation and he shared in the intellectual fashions of the period - the structure of his plays evolves from Old Com@@ edy until , in his last surviving play , &quot; Wealth II &quot; , it more closely resembles New Com@@ edy .
however it is uncertain whether he led or merely responded to changes in audience expectations .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es won second prize at the City Di@@ ony@@ sia in 427 BC with his first play &quot; The Ban@@ que@@ ters &quot; .
he won first prize there with his next play , &quot; The Babylon@@ ians &quot; .
it was usual for foreign dignitaries to attend the City Di@@ ony@@ sia , and &quot; The Babylon@@ ians &quot; caused some embarrassment for the Ath@@ en@@ ian authorities since it depicted the cities of the Del@@ ian League as slaves grinding at a mill .
some influential citizens , notably Cle@@ on , rev@@ iled the play as slander against the &quot; polis &quot; and possibly took legal action against the author .
the details of the trial are unrecorded but , speaking through the hero of his third play &quot; The Achar@@ n@@ ians &quot; , the poet carefully distinguishes between the &quot; polis &quot; and the real targets of his ac@@ er@@ bic wit : Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es repeatedly sav@@ ages Cle@@ on in his later plays .
but these sati@@ rical di@@ atri@@ bes appear to have had no effect on Cle@@ on &apos;s political career - a few weeks after the performance of &quot; The K@@ nights &quot; - a play full of anti @-@ Cle@@ on jokes - Cle@@ on was elected to the prestigious board of ten generals .
Cle@@ on also seems to have had no real power to limit or control Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es : the car@@ ic@@ atures of him continued up to and even beyond his death .
in the absence of clear biographical facts about Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es , scholars make educated gu@@ esses based on interpretation of the language in the plays .
inscriptions and summaries or comments by Hell@@ en@@ istic and Byzantine scholars can also provide useful clues .
we know however from a combination of these sources , and especially from comments in &quot; The K@@ nights &quot; and &quot; The Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; , that Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; first three plays were not directed by him - they were instead directed by Calli@@ str@@ atus and Phil@@ one@@ ides , an arrangement that seemed to suit Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es since he appears to have used these same directors in many later plays as well Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos;s use of directors complicates our reliance on the plays as sources of biographical information because apparent self @-@ references might have been made with reference to his directors instead .
thus for example a statement by the chorus in &quot; The Achar@@ n@@ ians &quot; seems to indicate that the &apos; poet &apos; had a close , personal association with the island of Aeg@@ ina , yet the terms &apos; poet &apos; and &apos; director &apos; are often interchangeable as dramatic poets usually directed their own plays and therefore the reference in the play could be either to Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es or Calli@@ str@@ atus .
similarly , the hero in &quot; The Achar@@ n@@ ians &quot; complains about Cle@@ on &quot; dragging me into court &quot; over &quot; last year &apos;s play &quot; but here again it is not clear if this was said in reference to Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es or Calli@@ str@@ atus , either of whom might have been prosecuted by Cle@@ on .
comments made by the Ch@@ orus referring to Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es in &quot; The Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; have been interpreted as evidence that he can hardly have been more than 18 years old when his first play &quot; The Ban@@ que@@ ters &quot; was produced .
the second par@@ ab@@ asis in &quot; Was@@ ps &quot; appears to indicate that he reached some kind of temporary accommodation with Cle@@ on following either the controversy over &quot; The Babylon@@ ians &quot; or a subsequent controversy over &quot; The K@@ nights &quot; .
it has been inferred from statements in &quot; The Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; and &quot; Peace &quot; that Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es was prematurely bald .
we know that Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es was probably victorious at least once at the City Di@@ ony@@ sia and at least three times at the Len@@ aia , with &quot; The Achar@@ n@@ ians &quot; in 425 , &quot; K@@ nights &quot; in 424 , and &quot; Fro@@ gs &quot; in 405 . &quot;
frogs &quot; in fact won the unique distinction of a repeat performance at a subsequent festival .
we know that a son of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es , Ar@@ ar@@ os , was also a comic poet and he could have been heavily involved in the production of his father &apos;s play &quot; Wealth II &quot; in 388 .
Ar@@ ar@@ os is also thought to have been responsible for the pos@@ thum@@ ous performances of the now lost plays &quot; A@@ e@@ ol@@ os@@ icon II &quot; and &quot; Coc@@ al@@ us &quot; , and it is possible that the last of these won the prize at the City Di@@ ony@@ sia in 387 .
</p>
<p>
the language of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; plays , and in Old Com@@ edy generally , was valued by ancient commentators as a model of the At@@ tic dialect .
the or@@ ator Qu@@ inti@@ lian believed that the charm and grandeur of the At@@ tic dialect made Old Com@@ edy an example for or@@ ators to study and follow , and he considered it inferior in these respects only to the works of Homer .
a revival of interest in the At@@ tic dialect may have been responsible for the recovery and circulation of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; plays during the 4th and 5th centuries AD , resulting in their survival today .
in Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; plays , the At@@ tic dialect is couched in verse and his plays can be appreciated for their poetic qualities .
for Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; contemporaries the works of Homer and He@@ si@@ od formed the cornerstones of Hellenic history and culture .
thus poetry had a moral and social significance that made it an inevitable topic of comic satire .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es was very conscious of literary fashions and traditions and his plays feature numerous references to other poets .
these include not only rival comic dram@@ atists such as Eu@@ polis and Her@@ m@@ ip@@ pus and predecessors such as Mag@@ nes , C@@ rates and Cr@@ atin@@ us , but also trage@@ dians , notably Aes@@ ch@@ yl@@ us , Sop@@ ho@@ cles and E@@ uri@@ p@@ ides , all three of whom are mentioned in e.g. &quot;
the Fro@@ gs &quot; .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es was the equal of these great trage@@ dians in his subtle use of lyrics .
he appears to have modelled his approach to language on that of E@@ uri@@ p@@ ides in particular , so much so that the comic dramatist Cr@@ atin@@ us labelled him a &apos; E@@ uri@@ p@@ id@@ ari@@ stop@@ han@@ ist &apos; addicted to hair @-@ splitting nic@@ eties .
a full appreciation of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; plays requires an understanding of the poetic forms he employed with virtu@@ oso skill , and of their different rhythms and associations .
there were three broad poetic forms : i@@ amb@@ ic dialogue , tetra@@ meter verses and lyrics : : :
how many are the things that v@@ ex my heart ! : :
pleasures are few , so very few - just four - : : but stressful things are man@@ ys@@ and@@ thousand@@ sand@@ heaps ! :
here Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es employs a frequent device , arranging the syntax so that the final word in a line comes as a comic climax .
the hero &apos;s pleasures are so few he can number them but his causes for complaint are so many they beggar numerical description and he must invent his own word for them .
an@@ ap@@ estic rhythms are naturally jaun@@ ty and tro@@ cha@@ ic meter is suited to rapid delivery However , even though both these rhythms can seem to &apos; bowl along &apos; Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es often varies them through use of complex syntax and substituted meters , adapting the rhythms to the requirements of serious argument .
in an an@@ ap@@ estic passage in &quot; The Fro@@ gs &quot; , for instance , the character Aes@@ ch@@ yl@@ us presents a view of poetry that is supposed to be serious but which leads to a comic interruption by the god , Di@@ ony@@ sus : : : A@@ ES . :
it was Or@@ phe@@ us singing who taught us religion and how wrong people are when they kill , : :
and we learned from Mus@@ a@@ eus medicinal cures and the science of div@@ ination . : :
if it &apos;s farming you want , He@@ si@@ od knows it all , when to plant , when to harvest .
how god@@ like : : Homer got to be famous , I &apos;ll tell if you ask : he taught us what all good men should know , : : discipline , fortitude , battle @-@ readiness .
Di@@ o . : but no @-@ one taught Pan@@ to@@ cles - yesterday : : he was marching his men up and down on parade when the crest of his helmet fell off !
the rhythm begins at a typical an@@ ap@@ estic gallop , slows down to consider the revered poets He@@ si@@ od and Homer , then gall@@ ops off again to its comic conclusion at the expense of the unfortunate Pan@@ to@@ cles .
such subtle variations in rhythm are common in the plays , allowing for serious points to be made while still wh@@ etting the audience &apos;s appetite for the next joke .
though to myself I often seem : a bright chap and not awkward , None comes close to A@@ my@@ ni@@ as , :
son of Sel@@ los of the Big@@ wig Cl@@ an , a man I once saw : dine with rich Le@@ og@@ orus .
now as poor as Anti@@ phon , : he lives on apples and pomegran@@ ates Yet he got himself appointed : Ambassador to Phar@@ sal@@ us , Way up there in Thess@@ aly , : home of the poor Pen@@ est@@ es : happy to be where everyone : is as pen@@ nil@@ ess as he is ! :
the pun here in English translation is a weak version of the Greek pun Π@@ ε@@ ν@@ έ@@ σ@@ τ@@ α@@ ι@@ σ@@ ι @-@ π@@ ε@@ ν@@ έ@@ σ@@ τ@@ η@@ ς , &quot; Pen@@ é@@ sta@@ isi @-@ pen@@ é@@ st@@ ĕ@@ s &quot; , &quot; destitute . &quot; many of the pun@@ s in the plays are based on words that are similar rather than identical , and it has been observed that there could be more of them than scholars have yet been able to identify .
others are based on double meanings .
sometimes entire scenes are constructed on pun@@ s , as in &quot; The Achar@@ n@@ ians &quot; with the Meg@@ arian farmer and his pigs : the Meg@@ arian farmer defies the Ath@@ en@@ ian embargo against Meg@@ arian trade , and tries to trade his daughters disguised as pigs , except &quot; pig &quot; was ancient slang for &quot; vagina . &quot; since the embargo against Meg@@ ara was the pretext for the Pel@@ op@@ on@@ nesian War , Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es naturally concludes that this whole mess happened because of &quot; three c@@ unts . &quot; it can be argued that the most important feature of the language of the plays is imagery , particularly the use of simil@@ es , metaphors and pictorial expressions .
in &apos; The K@@ nights &apos; , for example , the ears of a character with selective hearing are represented as paras@@ ols that open and close .
in &quot; The Fro@@ gs &quot; , Aes@@ ch@@ yl@@ us is said to compose verses in the manner of a horse rolling in a sand@@ pit .
some plays feature revelations of human perfec@@ tibility that are poetic rather than religious in character , such as the marriage of the hero Pis@@ the@@ tai@@ ros to Zeus &apos;s param@@ our in &quot; The Birds &quot; and the &apos; recreation &apos; of old Athens , crowned with roses , at the end of &quot; The K@@ nights &quot; .

<p>
it is widely believed that Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es condemned rhetoric on both moral and political grounds .
one of the main reasons why Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es was so against the sop@@ hists came into existence from the requirements listed by the leaders of the organization .
money was essential , which meant that roughly all of the pupils studying with the sop@@ hists came from upper @-@ class backgrounds and excluded the rest of the polis .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es believed that education and knowledge was a public service and that anything that excluded willing minds was nothing but an abomination .
he concludes that all politicians that study rhetoric must have &quot; doubtful citizen@@ ships , unspeakable morals , and too much arrogance &quot;

the Greek word for comedy derives from the words for &apos; rev@@ el &apos; and &apos; song &apos; and according to Aristotle comic drama actually developed from song .
the first official comedy at the City Di@@ ony@@ sia was not staged until 487 / 6 BC , by which time tragedy had already been long established there .
the first comedy at the Len@@ aia was staged later still , only about 20 years before the performance there of &quot; The Achar@@ n@@ ians &quot; , the first of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; surviving plays .
according to Aristotle , comedy was slow to gain official acceptance because nobody took it seriously , yet only 60 years after comedy first appeared at the City Di@@ ony@@ sia , Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es observed that producing come@@ dies was the most difficult work of all .
competition at the Di@@ ony@@ sian festivals needed dramatic conventions for plays to be judged , but it also fuelled innovations .
developments were quite rapid and Aristotle could distinguish between &apos; old &apos; and &apos; new &apos; comedy by 330 BC .
the trend from Old Com@@ edy to New Com@@ edy saw a move away from highly topical concerns with real individuals and local issues towards generalized situations and stock characters .
this was partly due to the internationalization of cultural perspectives during and after the Pel@@ op@@ on@@ nesian War .
for ancient commentators such as Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch , New Com@@ edy was a more sophisticated form of drama than Old Com@@ edy .
however , Old Com@@ edy was in fact a complex and sophisticated dramatic form incorporating many approaches to humour and entertainment .
in Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; early plays , the genre appears to have developed around a complex set of dramatic conventions , and these were only gradually simplified and abandoned .
the City Di@@ ony@@ sia and the Len@@ aia were celebrated in honour of Di@@ ony@@ sus , the god of wine and ecstasy .
old Com@@ edy can be understood as a celebration of the exuberant sense of release inherent in his worship It was more interested in finding targets for satire than in any kind of advocacy .
during the City Di@@ ony@@ sia , a statue of the god was brought to the theatre from a temple outside the city , and it remained in the theatre throughout the festival , overseeing the plays like a privileged member of the audience .
in &quot; The Fro@@ gs &quot; , the god appears also as a dramatic character , and he enters the theatre ludic@@ rou@@ sly disguised as Hercules .
he observes to the audience that every time he is on hand to hear a joke from a comic dramatist like Ph@@ r@@ yn@@ ich@@ us he ages by more than a year .
this scene opens the play , and it is a reminder to the audience that nobody is above mockery in Old Com@@ edy - not even its patron god and its practitioners .
gods , artists , politicians and ordinary citizens were legitimate targets , comedy was a kind of licensed buff@@ o@@ on@@ ery , and there was no legal redress for anyone who was slan@@ dered in a play .
there were certain limits to the scope of the satire , but they are not easily defined .
imp@@ i@@ ety could be punished in 5th century Athens , but the absur@@ dities implicit in the traditional religion were open to ridicule .
the polis was not allowed to be slan@@ dered , but as stated in the biography section of this article , that could depend on who was in the audience and which festival was involved .
for convenience , Old Com@@ edy , as represented by Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; early plays , is analysed below in terms of three broad characteristics - top@@ icality , festi@@ vity and complexity .
dramatic structure contributes to the complexity of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; plays .
however , it is associated with poetic rhythms and meters that have little relevance to English translations and it is therefore treated in a separate section .
</p>
<p>
old Com@@ edy &apos;s emphasis on real personalities and local issues makes the plays difficult to appreciate today without the aid of scholarly commentaries - see for example articles on &quot; The K@@ nights &quot; , &quot; The Was@@ ps &quot; and &quot; Peace &quot; for lists of topical references .
the top@@ icality of the plays had unique consequences for both the writing and the production of the plays in ancient Athens .
</p>
<p>
the Len@@ aia and City Di@@ ony@@ sia were religious festivals , but they resembled a gala rather than a church service .
</p>
<p>
the development of New Com@@ edy involved a trend towards more realistic plots , a simpler dramatic structure and a softer tone .
old Com@@ edy was the comedy of a vigorously democratic polis at the height of its power and it gave Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es the freedom to explore the limits of humour , even to the point of undermining the humour itself .
</p>
<p>
the structural elements of a typical Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ ic plot can be summarized as follows :
in &quot; The Achar@@ n@@ ians &quot; and &quot; Peace &quot; , for example , there is no formal agon whereas in &quot; The Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; there are two ag@@ ons .
</p>
<p>
the par@@ ab@@ asis is an address to the audience by the chorus or chorus leader while the actors leave or have left the stage .
in this role , the chorus is sometimes out of character , as the author &apos;s voice , and sometimes in character , although these capacities are often difficult to distinguish .
generally the par@@ ab@@ asis occurs somewhere in the middle of a play and often there is a second par@@ ab@@ asis towards the end .
the elements of a par@@ ab@@ asis have been defined and named by scholars but it is probable that Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; own understanding was less formal .
the selection of elements can vary from play to play and it varies considerably within plays between first and second par@@ ab@@ asis .
textual corruption is probably the reason for the absence of the anti@@ stro@@ phe in the second par@@ ab@@ asis .
however , there are several variations from the ideal even within the early plays .
for example , the par@@ ab@@ asis proper in &quot; The Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; is composed in eu@@ poli@@ dean meter rather than in an@@ ap@@ ests and the second par@@ ab@@ asis includes a kom@@ mation but it lacks stro@@ phe , anti@@ stro@@ phe and ante@@ pir@@ r@@ hem@@ a .
the second par@@ ab@@ asis in &quot; The Achar@@ n@@ ians &quot; lines 9@@ 71 @-@ 99 can be considered a hybrid par@@ ab@@ asis / song and , unlike the typical par@@ ab@@ asis , it seems to comment on actions that occur on stage during the address .
an understanding of Old Com@@ edy conventions such as the par@@ ab@@ asis is necessary for a proper understanding of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; plays ; on the other hand , a sensitive appreciation of the plays is necessary for a proper understanding of the conventions .
</p>
<p>
the tragic dram@@ atists , Sop@@ ho@@ cles and E@@ uri@@ p@@ ides , died near the end of the Pel@@ op@@ on@@ nesian War and the art of tragedy thereafter ceased to develop , yet comedy did continue to evolve after the defeat of Athens and it is possible that it did so because , in Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es , it had a master craftsman who lived long enough to help usher it into a new age .
indeed , according to one ancient source , one of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos;s last plays , &quot; Ai@@ ol@@ is@@ k@@ on &quot; , had neither a par@@ ab@@ asis nor any ch@@ oral lyrics , while &quot; Kol@@ ak@@ os &quot; anticipated all the elements of New Com@@ edy , including a rape and a recognition scene .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es seems to have had some appreciation of his formative role in the development of comedy , as indicated by his comment in &quot; Cl@@ ou@@ ds &quot; that his audience would be judged by other times according to its reception of his plays . &quot;
clouds &quot; was awarded third place after its original performance and the text that has come down to the modern age was a subsequent draft that Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es intended to be read rather than acted .
the circulation of his plays in manuscript extended their influence beyond the original audience , over whom in fact they seem to have had little or no practical influence : they did not affect the career of Cle@@ on , they failed to persuade the Ath@@ en@@ ians to pursue an honourable peace with Spart@@ a and it is not clear that they were instrumental in the trial and execution of Socrates , whose death probably resulted from public animosity towards the philosopher &apos;s dis@@ graced associates , exacerbated of course by his own intransigence during the trial .
the plays , in manuscript form , have been put to some surprising uses - as indicated earlier , they were used in the study of rhetoric on the recommendation of Qu@@ inti@@ lian and by students of the At@@ tic dialect in the Fourth and Fifth Cen@@ tu@@ ries AD .
it is possible that Plato sent copies of the plays to Di@@ ony@@ sius of Sy@@ rac@@ use so that he might learn about Ath@@ en@@ ian life and government .
Latin translations of the plays by Andreas Di@@ v@@ us were circulated widely throughout Europe in the Renaissance and these were soon followed by translations and adaptations in modern languages .
Rac@@ ine , for example , drew &quot; Les Pla@@ ide@@ urs &quot; from &quot; The Was@@ ps &quot; .
Go@@ ethe adapted a short play &quot; Die V@@ ö@@ gel &quot; from &quot; The Birds &quot; for performance in We@@ im@@ ar .
Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es has appealed to both conservatives and radicals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries - Anatol@@ y Lun@@ ach@@ ar@@ sky , first Commiss@@ ar of Enlightenment for the USSR in 1917 , declared that the ancient dramatist would have a permanent place in prolet@@ arian theatre and yet conservative , Pr@@ ussian intellectuals interpreted Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es as a sati@@ rical opponent of social reform .
the av@@ ant @-@ gar@@ dist stage @-@ director Kar@@ olos K@@ oun directed a version of &quot; The Birds &quot; under the Ac@@ ro@@ polis in 1959 that established a trend in modern Greek history of breaking taboos through the voice of Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es .
the plays have a significance that goes beyond their artistic function , as historical documents that open the window on life and politics in classical Athens , in which respect they are perhaps as important as the writings of Thu@@ cy@@ di@@ des .
the artistic influence of the plays is immeasurable .
they have contributed to the history of European theatre and that history in turn shapes our understanding of the plays .
thus for example the oper@@ et@@ tas of Gilbert and Sullivan can give us insights into Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es &apos; plays and similarly the plays can give us insights into the oper@@ et@@ tas .
the plays are a source of famous sayings , such as &quot; By words the mind is winged . &quot; listed below is a random and very tiny sample of works influenced by Ari@@ stop@@ han@@ es .

Albert Schwe@@ itzer , OM was an Al@@ sati@@ an the@@ ologi@@ an , organ@@ ist , writer , humanitarian , philosopher , and physician .
a Lutheran , Schwe@@ itzer challenged both the secular view of Jesus as depicted by the historical @-@ critical method current at this time , as well as the traditional Christian view .
his contributions to the interpretation of Pauline Christianity concern the role of Paul &apos;s mys@@ ticism of &quot; being in Christ &quot; as primary and the doctrine of Justi@@ fication by Faith as secondary .
he received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize for his philosophy of &quot; Rever@@ ence for Life , &quot; becoming the eighth Frenchman to be awarded that prize .
his philosophy was expressed in many ways , but most famously in founding and sustaining the Albert Schwe@@ itzer Hospital in Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é , in the part of French Equatorial Africa which is now Gabon .
as a music scholar and organ@@ ist , he studied the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and influenced the Organ Reform Movement .
</p>
<p>
Schwe@@ itzer was born in the province of Al@@ s@@ ace , which was a part of the Holy Roman Empire up to the Thirty Year War .
in 16@@ 48 , with the Treaty of Westph@@ alia , the H@@ abs@@ bur@@ gs renounced their claims to its territory , when it became a part of France for the first time .
in 18@@ 71 , through the Treaty of Frankfurt , Al@@ s@@ ace became a part of the German Empire , becoming French a second time in 1919 , after Germany &apos;s defeat during the First World War .
Schwe@@ itzer considered himself French , but wrote mostly in German .
his mother @-@ tongue was Al@@ sati@@ an , a Low Alem@@ ann@@ ic German dialect , although he was also fluent in French and High @-@ German .
</p>
<p>
Schwe@@ itzer was born in Kay@@ ser@@ sberg , Hau@@ te Al@@ s@@ ace , the son of Louis Schwe@@ itzer and Ad@@ è@@ le S@@ chil@@ linger .
he spent his childhood in the Al@@ sati@@ an village of Gun@@ sb@@ ach , where his father , the local Lutheran @-@ Evangelical pastor of the EP@@ CA@@ AL , taught him how to play music .
the tiny village became home to the Association Internationale Albert Schwe@@ itzer .
the medieval parish church of Gun@@ sb@@ ach was shared by the Protestant and Catholic congregations , which held their prayers in different areas at different times on Sundays .
this compromise arose after the Protestant Re@@ formation and the Thirty Years &apos; War .
Schwe@@ itzer , the pastor &apos;s son , grew up in this exceptional environment of religious tolerance , and developed the belief that true Christianity should always work towards a unity of faith and purpose .
Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s first language was the Al@@ sati@@ an dialect of German language .
at the Mul@@ house gymnasium he received his &quot; A@@ bit@@ ur &quot; in 18@@ 93 .
he studied organ in Mul@@ house from 18@@ 85 to 18@@ 93 with Eu@@ g@@ ène Mun@@ ch , organ@@ ist at the Protestant cathedral , who inspired Schwe@@ itzer with his profound enthusiasm for the music of German composer Richard Wagner .
in 18@@ 93 he played for the French organ@@ ist Charles @-@ Marie Wid@@ or , for whom Johann Sebastian Bach &apos;s organ music contained a mystic sense of the eternal .
Wid@@ or , deeply impressed , agreed to teach Schwe@@ itzer without fee , and a great and influential friendship thus began .
from 18@@ 93 Schwe@@ itzer studied Protestant theology at the Ka@@ iser Wilhelm University in Strasbourg .
there he also received instruction in piano and counter@@ point from professor Gust@@ av Jac@@ obs@@ thal , and associated closely with Ernest Mun@@ ch , the brother of his former teacher , organ@@ ist of St William church , who was also a passionate admirer of J.@@ S. Bach &apos;s music .
Schwe@@ itzer served his one @-@ year compulsory military service in 1894 .
Schwe@@ itzer saw many operas of Richard Wagner in Strasbourg and in 1896 he managed to afford a visit to the Bay@@ re@@ uth Festival to see Wagner &apos;s &quot; Der Ring des Ni@@ bel@@ un@@ gen &quot; and &quot; Par@@ sif@@ al &quot; , which deeply impressed him .
in 1898 he went back to Paris to write a PhD dissertation on &quot; The Religious Philosophy of Kant &quot; at the Sor@@ b@@ onne , and to study in earnest with Wid@@ or .
here he often met with the elderly Aristide Cav@@ a@@ ill@@ é @-@ Coll .
he also studied piano at that time with Marie Ja@@ ë@@ ll .
in 1899 , Schwe@@ itzer spent the summer semester at the University of Berlin and eventually obtained his theology degree in University of Strasbourg .
he published his PhD thesis at the University of T@@ ü@@ b@@ ingen in 1899 .
in 1905 , Schwe@@ itzer began his study of medicine at the University of Strasbourg , culminating in the degree of M.@@ D. in 19@@ 13 .
</p>
<p>
Schwe@@ itzer rapidly gained prominence as a musical scholar and organ@@ ist , dedicated also to the rescue , restoration and study of historic pipe organs .
with theological insight , he interpreted the use of pictorial and symbol@@ ical representation in J. S. Bach &apos;s religious music .
in 1899 he astonished Wid@@ or by explaining figures and mo@@ tif@@ s in Bach &apos;s Chor@@ ale Prel@@ udes as painter @-@ like tonal and rhythmic imagery illustrating themes from the words of the hym@@ ns on which they were based .
they were works of devo@@ tional contemplation in which the musical design corresponded to literary ideas , conceived visually .
Wid@@ or had not grown up with knowledge of the old Lutheran hym@@ ns .
the exposition of these ideas , encouraged by Wid@@ or and Mun@@ ch , became Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s last task , and appeared in the master@@ ly study &quot; J. S. Bach : Le Mus@@ ici@@ en @-@ Po@@ è@@ te &quot; , written in French and published in 1905 .
there was great demand for a German edition , but , instead of translating it , he decided to rewrite it .
the result was two volumes , which were published in 1908 and translated into English by Ernest New@@ man in 1911 .
Ernst Cassi@@ r@@ er , a contemporaneous German philosopher , called it &quot; one of the best interpretations &quot; of Bach .
during its preparation Schwe@@ itzer became a friend of Co@@ sim@@ a Wagner , then resident in Strasbourg , with whom he had many theological and musical conversations , exploring his view of Bach &apos;s descriptive music , and playing the major Chor@@ ale Prel@@ udes for her at the Temple Neu@@ f .
Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s interpretative approach greatly influenced the modern understanding of Bach &apos;s music .
he became a welcome guest at the Wag@@ ners &apos; home , Wa@@ hn@@ fried .
he also corresponded with composer Clara Fais@@ st , who became a good friend .
his pamphlet &quot; The Art of Organ Building and Organ P@@ laying in Germany and France &quot; effectively launched the 20th @-@ century &quot; Or@@ gel@@ be@@ weg@@ ung &quot; , which turned away from romantic extremes and re@@ discovered bar@@ oque principles - although this sweeping reform movement in organ building eventually went further than Schwe@@ itzer had intended .
in 19@@ 09 he addressed the &quot; Third Congress of the International Society of Music &quot; at Vienna on the subject .
having circulated a questionnaire among players and organ @-@ builders in several European countries , he produced a very considered report .
this provided the basis for the &quot; International Regulations for Organ Building &quot; .
he envisaged instruments in which the French late @-@ romantic full @-@ organ sound should work integrally with the English and German romantic reed pipes , and with the classical Al@@ s@@ ace Sil@@ ber@@ mann organ resources and bar@@ oque flue pipes , all in registers regulated to access distinct voices in fu@@ gue or counter@@ point capable of combination without loss of distinc@@ tness : different voices singing the same music together .
Schwe@@ itzer also studied piano under I@@ sid@@ or Philip@@ p , head of the piano department at the Paris Conserv@@ atory .
in 1905 Wid@@ or and Schwe@@ itzer were among the six musicians who founded the Paris Bach Society , a choir dedicated to performing J.@@ S. Bach &apos;s music , for whose concerts Schwe@@ itzer took the organ part regularly until 19@@ 13 .
he was also appointed organ@@ ist for the Bach Concer@@ ts of the Or@@ f@@ é@@ o Catal@@ à at Barcelona , Spain , and often travelled there for that purpose .
he and Wid@@ or collaborated on a new edition of Bach &apos;s organ works , with detailed analysis of each work in three languages .
Schwe@@ itzer , who insisted that the score should show Bach &apos;s notation with no additional markings , wrote the commentaries for the Prel@@ udes and Fu@@ gues , and Wid@@ or those for the Son@@ atas and Concer@@ tos : six volumes were published in 1912 @-@ 14 .
three more , to contain the Chor@@ ale Prel@@ udes with Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s analyses , were to be worked on in Africa , but these were never completed , perhaps because for him they were inseparable from his evolving theological thought .
on departure for Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é in 19@@ 13 he was presented with a pedal piano , a piano with pedal attachments to operate like an organ pedal @-@ keyboard .
built especially for the tropics , it was delivered by river in a huge dug @-@ out canoe to Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é , packed in a zinc @-@ lined case .
at first he regarded his new life as a renunciation of his art , and fell out of practice : but after some time he resolved to study and learn by heart the works of Bach , Mend@@ el@@ s@@ sohn , Wid@@ or , Cé@@ sar Fran@@ ck , and Max Reg@@ er systematically .
it became his custom to play during the lunch hour and on Sunday afternoons .
Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s pedal piano was still in use at Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é in 1946 .
according to a visitor , Dr. G@@ aine C@@ annon , of Bal@@ sam Gro@@ ve , N.@@ C. , the old , dilapidated piano @-@ organ was still being played by Dr. Schwe@@ itzer in 1962 , and stories told that &quot; his fingers were still lively &quot; on the old instrument at 88 years of age .
Sir Donald T@@ ov@@ ey dedicated his conjec@@ tural completion of Bach &apos;s &quot; The Art of Fu@@ gue &quot; to Schwe@@ itzer .
Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s recordings of organ @-@ music , and his innovative recording technique , are described below .
one of his notable pupils was conductor and composer Hans Mü@@ n@@ ch .
</p>
<p>
in 1899 Schwe@@ itzer became a de@@ acon at the church of Saint Nicholas in Strasbourg .
in 1900 , with the completion of his lic@@ enti@@ ate in theology , he was ordained as cur@@ ate , and that year he witnessed the Ober@@ am@@ mer@@ g@@ au Pas@@ sion Play .
in the following year he became provisional Principal of the The@@ ological College of Saint Thomas , from which he had just graduated , and in 1903 his appointment was made permanent .
in 1906 he published &quot; Ges@@ ch@@ ich@@ te der Le@@ ben @-@ Je@@ su @-@ For@@ sch@@ ung &quot; .
this book , which established his reputation , was first published in English in 1910 as &quot; The Quest of the Historical Jesus &quot; .
under this title the book became famous in the English @-@ speaking world .
a second German edition was published in 19@@ 13 , containing the@@ ologically significant revisions and expansions : but this revised edition did not appear in English until 2001 .
in 1931 he published &quot; My@@ sti@@ k des Apost@@ els Paul@@ us &quot; ; a second edition was published in 1953 .
</p>
<p>
in The Quest , Schwe@@ itzer reviewed all former work on the &quot; historical Jesus &quot; back to the late 18th century .
he showed that the image of Jesus had changed with the times and outlooks of the various authors and gave his own synopsis and interpretation of the previous century &apos;s findings .
he maintained that the life of Jesus must be interpreted in the light of Jesus &apos; own convictions , which reflected late Jewish es@@ ch@@ atology and apocaly@@ p@@ ticism .
Schwe@@ itzer writes : the Jesus of Nazareth who came forward publicly as the Messi@@ ah , who preached the ethic of the kingdom of God , who founded the kingdom of heaven upon earth and died to give his work its final consec@@ ration never existed .
he is a figure designed by ration@@ alism , endowed with life by liberalism , and clothed by modern theology in a historical gar@@ b .
this image has not been destroyed from outside ; it has fallen to pieces ... &#91; 36 &#93; He observes the many verses describing important events that never took place and technically , now , never can take place .
the concept that Christianity started as a Jewish apocaly@@ p@@ tic movement is evidenced by the teachings of the historical Jesus concerning the end of days .
not only did he preach he would rise from the grave , but that he would also ascend to heaven and one day return to judge and rule over the world , saying that no one , including himself , knew the exact time of his return , but it would be before the end of the end of the first generation of followers .
in The Quest of the Historical Jesus , Schwe@@ itzer verifies and cross @-@ referenced the many New Testament verses declaring imminent fulfillment of the promise of the World &apos;s ending within the lifetime of Jesus &apos;s original followers . &#91; 37 &#93; He noted that in the gospel of Mark , Jesus speaks of a &quot; trib@@ ulation , &quot; with his &quot; coming in the clouds with great power and glory &quot; , and states when it will happen :
&quot; this generation shall not pass , till all these things be fulfilled &quot; or , &quot; have taken place &quot; .
similarly , in 1st Peter 1 : 20 , &quot; Christ , who verily was fore@@ ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you , &quot; as well as &quot; But the end of all things is at hand , &quot; and &quot; Surely , I come quickly . &quot; .
Schwe@@ itzer observes that Jesus very specifically states &quot; not seal up the words of the prophecy &quot; and promises that some of his listeners , as well as the high priest at his trial , would be alive to see him return to the Earth .
he says , &quot; Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it ; for the time is near &quot; .
St. Paul spoke of the last times , &quot; Bre@@ thren , the time is short , it remain@@ eth , that both they that have wives be as though they had none , &quot; and &quot; God hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son , &quot; .
also , &quot; There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom &quot; as well as &quot; until they see that the kingdom of God has come with power , &quot; and &quot; till they see the kingdom of God &quot; reinforce this prophecy .
Schwe@@ itzer observes that St. Paul , urgently , believed in the immediacy of the Second Coming of Jesus .
Schwe@@ itzer insists that it is unreasonable for modern followers of Jesus to believe that &quot; coming quickly , &quot; &quot; near , &quot; and &quot; soon &quot; could mean hundreds , much less thousands , of years of the faithful waiting for a second coming .
Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s observations are in stark contrast to many modern variants of Christian belief , those ignoring these verses .
Schwe@@ itzer concludes that 1st @-@ century Christian theology ; first belief , originating in the lifetimes of the very first followers of Jesus , is totally incompatible with modern theology .
</p>
<p>
in &quot; The M@@ ys@@ ticism of Paul the Apost@@ le &quot; , Schwe@@ itzer first distinguishes between two categories of mys@@ ticism : primitive and developed .
primitive mys@@ ticism &quot; has not yet risen to a conception of the universal , and is still confined to naive views of earthly and super @-@ earthly , temporal and eternal . &quot; additionally , he argues that this view of a &quot; union with the divinity , brought about by efficacious ceremonies , is found even in quite primitive religions . &quot; on the other hand , a more developed form of mys@@ ticism can be found in the Greek mystery @-@ cults that were popular in first @-@ century A.D. society .
these included the cults of At@@ tis , O@@ si@@ ris , and Mi@@ thr@@ as .
a developed form of mys@@ ticism is attained when the &quot; conception of the universal is reached and a man reflects upon his relation to the totality of being and to Being in itself . &quot; Schwe@@ itzer claims that this form of mys@@ ticism is more intellectual and can be found &quot; among the Brah@@ mans and in the Buddha , in Plat@@ onism , in Sto@@ icism , in Spin@@ oza , Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er , and Heg@@ el . &quot; next , Schwe@@ itzer poses the question :
&quot; of what precise kind then is the mys@@ ticism of Paul ? &quot; he locates Paul between the two extremes of primitive mys@@ ticism and developed mys@@ ticism .
Paul stands high above primitive mys@@ ticism , due to his intellectual writings , but never speaks of being one with God or being in God .
instead , he concei@@ ves of son@@ ship to God as &quot; mediated and effected by means of the mystical union with Christ . &quot; he summarizes Pauline mys@@ ticism as &quot; being in Christ &quot; rather than &quot; being in God . &quot; Paul &apos;s imminent es@@ ch@@ atology causes him to believe that the kingdom of God has not yet come and that Christians are now living in the time of Christ .
Christ @-@ mys@@ ticism holds the field until God @-@ mys@@ ticism becomes possible , which is in the near future .
therefore , Schwe@@ itzer argues that Paul is the only the@@ ologi@@ an who does not claim that Christians can have an experience of &quot; being @-@ in @-@ God . &quot; rather , Paul uses the phrase &quot; being @-@ in @-@ Christ &quot; to illustrate how Jesus is a mediator between the Christian community and God .
additionally , Schwe@@ itzer explains how the experience of &quot; being @-@ in @-@ Christ &quot; is not a &quot; static par@@ taking in the spiritual being of Christ , but as the real co @-@ experiencing of His dying and rising again . &quot; the &quot; realistic &quot; par@@ taking in the mystery of Jesus is only possible within the solidarity of the Christian community .
one of Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s major arguments in &quot; The M@@ ys@@ ticism of Paul the Apost@@ le &quot; is that Paul &apos;s mys@@ ticism , marked by his phrase &quot; being in Christ , &quot; gives the clue to the whole of Pauline theology .
rather than reading justification by faith as the main topic of Pauline thought , which has been the most popular argument set forward by Martin Luther , Schwe@@ itzer argues that Paul &apos;s emphasis was on the mystical union with God by &quot; being in Christ . &quot; Jar@@ o@@ slav Pel@@ ikan , in his Forward to &quot; The M@@ ys@@ ticism of Paul the Apost@@ le , &quot; points out that : the relation between the two doctrines was quite the other way around :
&apos;the doctrine of the redemption , which is mentally appropriated through faith , is only a fragment from the more comprehensive mystical redemption @-@ doctrine , which Paul has broken off and polished to give him the particular refraction which he requires .
</p>
<p>
Schwe@@ itzer contrasts Paul &apos;s &quot; realistic &quot; dying and rising with Christ to the &quot; symbolism &quot; of Hell@@ en@@ ism .
although Paul is widely influenced by Hell@@ en@@ istic thought , he is not controlled by it .
Schwe@@ itzer explains that Paul focused on the idea of fellowship with the divine being through the &quot; realistic &quot; dying and rising with Christ rather than the &quot; symbolic &quot; Hell@@ en@@ istic act of becoming like Christ through de@@ ification .
after baptism , the Christian is continually renewed throughout their lifetime due to participation in the dying and rising with Christ .
on the other hand , the Hell@@ en@@ ist &quot; lives on the store of experience which he acquired in the initiation &quot; and is not continually affected by a shared communal experience .
another major difference between Paul &apos;s &quot; realism &quot; and Hell@@ en@@ istic &quot; symbolism &quot; is the exclusive nature of the former and the inclusive nature of the latter .
Schwe@@ itzer un@@ ab@@ as@@ he@@ dly emphasizes the fact that &quot; Paul &apos;s thought follows pre@@ destin@@ arian lines . &quot; he explains , &quot; only the man who is elected thereto can enter into relation with God . &quot; although every human being is invited to become a Christian , only those who have undergone the initiation into the Christian community through baptism can share in the &quot; realistic &quot; dying and rising with Christ .

at the age of 30 , in 1905 , Schwe@@ itzer answered the call of The Society of the Ev@@ angel@@ ist Missions of Paris , which was looking for a medical doctor .
however , the committee of this missionary society was not ready to accept his offer , considering his Lutheran theology to be &quot; incorrect . &quot; he could easily have obtained a place in a German evangelical mission , but wished to follow the original call despite the doctrinal difficulties .
amid a hail of protests from his friends , family and colleagues , he resigned his post and re @-@ entered the university as a student in a three @-@ year course towards the degree of Doc@@ torate in Medicine , a subject in which he had little knowledge or previous aptitude .
he planned to spread the Gospel by the example of his Christian labour of healing , rather than through the verbal process of preaching , and believed that this service should be acceptable within any branch of Christian teaching .
even in his study of medicine , and through his clinical course , Schwe@@ itzer pursued the ideal of the philosopher @-@ scientist .
by extreme application and hard work , he completed his studies successfully at the end of 1911 .
his medical degree dissertation was another work on the historical Jesus , &quot; The Psychiatric Study of Jesus &quot; .
he defended Jesus ′ mental health in it .
in June 1912 , he married Hel@@ ene B@@ res@@ sla@@ u , municipal inspector for orphans and daughter of the Jewish pan @-@ German@@ ist historian Harry B@@ res@@ sla@@ u .
in 1912 , now armed with a medical degree , Schwe@@ itzer made a definite proposal to go as a medical doctor to work at his own expense in the Paris Mission@@ ary Society &apos;s mission at Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é on the O@@ go@@ ou@@ é river , in what is now Gabon , in Africa .
he refused to attend a committee to inquire into his doctrine , but met each committee member personally and was at last accepted .
through concerts and other fund @-@ raising , he was ready to equip a small hospital .
in spring 19@@ 13 , he and his wife set off to establish a hospital near an existing mission post .
the site was nearly 200 miles upstream from the mouth of the O@@ go@@ ou@@ é at Port Genti@@ l , but downstream of most tribut@@ aries , so that internal communications within Gabon converged towards Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é .
in the first nine months , he and his wife had about 2,000 patients to examine , some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him .
in addition to injuries , he was often treating severe sand@@ flea and cra@@ w@@ cra@@ w sores , &quot; fra@@ m@@ bo@@ esia &quot; , tropical eating sores , heart disease , tropical dysentery , tropical malaria , sleeping sickness , leprosy , f@@ evers , strang@@ ulated herni@@ as , necrosis , abdominal tumours and chronic constipation and nicotine poisoning , while also attempting to deal with deliberate pois@@ onings , fe@@ ti@@ sh@@ ism and fear of canni@@ balism among the M@@ ba@@ hou@@ in .
Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s wife , Hel@@ ene Schwe@@ itzer , was an anaesthe@@ tist for surgical operations .
after briefly occupying a shed formerly used as a chicken hut , in autumn 19@@ 13 they built their first hospital of corrugated iron , with two 13 @-@ foot rooms and with a dispens@@ ary and steril@@ ising room in spaces below the broad e@@ aves .
the waiting room and dormitory were built , like native huts , of un@@ he@@ wn logs along a 30 @-@ yard path leading from the hospital to the landing @-@ place .
the Schwe@@ it@@ zers had their own bun@@ gal@@ ow and employed as their assistant Joseph , a French @-@ speaking G@@ aloa who first came as a patient .
after World War I broke out in July 1914 , Schwe@@ itzer and his wife , German citizens in a French colony when the countries were at war , were put under supervision by the French military at Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é , where Schwe@@ itzer continued his work .
in 1917 , exhausted by over four years &apos; work and by tropical anaemia , they were taken to Bordeaux and inter@@ ned first in Gar@@ a@@ ison and then from March 1918 in Saint @-@ Ré@@ my @-@ de @-@ Prov@@ ence .
in July 1918 , after being transferred to his home in Al@@ s@@ ace , he was a free man again .
at this time Schwe@@ itzer , born a German citizen , had his parents &apos; former French citizenship reinstated and became a French citizen .
then , working as medical assistant and assistant @-@ pastor in Strasbourg , he advanced his project on the philosophy of civilization , which had occupied his mind since 1900 .
by 1920 , his health recovering , he was giving organ rec@@ itals and doing other fund @-@ raising work to repay borrowings and raise funds for returning to Gabon .
in 1922 , he delivered the Dale Memorial Lec@@ tures in Oxford University , and from these in the following year appeared Vol@@ umes I and II of his great work , &quot; The Dec@@ ay and Restoration of Civilization &quot; and &quot; Civilization and Ethics &quot; .
the two remaining volumes , on &quot; The World @-@ View of Rever@@ ence for Life &quot; and a fourth on the Civil@@ ized State , were never completed .
in 1924 he returned without his wife , but with an Oxford undergraduate , Noel Gill@@ es@@ pie , as assistant .
everything was heavily decayed , and building and doctor@@ ing progressed together for months .
he now had sal@@ var@@ san for treating sy@@ ph@@ ili@@ tic ulcers and fra@@ m@@ bo@@ esia .
additional medical staff , nurse Kot@@ t@@ mann and Dr. Victor N@@ ess@@ mann , joined him in 1924 , and Dr. Mark Lau@@ ter@@ berg in 1925 ; the growing hospital was manned by native order@@ lies .
later Dr. Tren@@ s@@ z replaced N@@ ess@@ mann , and Martha Lau@@ ter@@ berg and Hans Mu@@ g@@ gen@@ storm joined them .
in 1925 @-@ 6 , new hospital buildings were constructed , and also a ward for white patients , so that the site became like a village .
the onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems .
much of the building work was carried out with the help of local people and patients .
drug advances for sleeping sickness included German@@ in and try@@ par@@ sam@@ ide .
Tren@@ s@@ z conducted experiments showing that the non @-@ amo@@ e@@ bic strain of dysentery was caused by a parach@@ olera vi@@ bri@@ on .
with the new hospital built and the medical team established , Schwe@@ itzer returned to Europe in 1927 , this time leaving a functioning hospital at work .
he was there again from 1929 to 1932 .
gradually his opinions and concepts became acknowledged , not only in Europe , but worldwide .
there was a further period of work in 1935 .
in January 1937 , he returned again to Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é and continued working there throughout World War II .

Schwe@@ itzer considered his work as a medical missionary in Africa to be his response to Jesus &apos; call to become &quot; fishers of men &quot; but also as a small recompense for the historic guilt of European colon@@ izers :
who can describe the injustice and cruel@@ ties that in the course of centuries they &#91; the coloured peoples &#93; have suffered at the hands of Europeans ? ...
if a record could be compiled of all that has happened between the white and the coloured races , it would make a book containing numbers of pages which the reader would have to turn over un@@ read because their contents would be too horrible .
Schwe@@ itzer was one of colonialism &apos;s harsh@@ est critics .
in a sermon that he preached on 6 January 1905 , before he had told anyone of his plans to dedicate the rest of his life to work as a doctor in Africa , he said : our culture divides people into two classes : civilized men , a title bestowed on the persons who do the classifying ; and others , who have only the human form , who may perish or go to the dogs for all the &apos; civilized men &apos; care . &quot;
Oh , this &apos; noble &apos; culture of ours !
it speaks so pi@@ ously of human dignity and human rights and then dis@@ regards this dignity and these rights of countless millions and t@@ reads them under@@ foot , only because they live overseas or because their skins are of different color or because they cannot help themselves .
this culture does not know how hollow and miserable and full of gli@@ b talk it is , how common it looks to those who follow it across the seas and see what it has done there , and this culture has no right to speak of personal dignity and human rights ...
I will not enumerate all the crimes that have been committed under the pretext of justice .
people robbed native inhabitants of their land , made slaves of them , let loose the scum of mankind upon them .
think of the atrocities that were perpetrated upon people made subservient to us , how systematically we have ruined them with our alcoholic &apos; gifts &apos; , and everything else we have done ...
we decim@@ ate them , and then , by the stroke of a pen , we take their land so they have nothing left at all ...
if all this oppression and all this sin and shame are perpetrated under the eye of the German God , or the American God , or the British God , and if our states do not feel obliged first to lay aside their claim to be &apos; Christian &apos; - then the name of Jesus is blasph@@ emed and made a mockery .
and the Christianity of our states is blasph@@ emed and made a mockery before those poor people .
the name of Jesus has become a curse , and our Christianity - yours and mine - has become a falsehood and a disgrace , if the crimes are not at@@ oned for in the very place where they were instigated .
for every person who committed an atrocity in Jesus &apos; name , someone must step in to help in Jesus &apos; name ; for every person who robbed , someone must bring a replacement ; for everyone who cursed , someone must bless .
and now , when you speak about missions , let this be your message :
we must make atonement for all the terrible crimes we read of in the newspapers .
we must make atonement for the still worse ones , which we do not read about in the papers , crimes that are shrouded in the silence of the jungle night ...

Schwe@@ itzer was nonetheless still sometimes accused of being patern@@ alistic , colonialist , and racist in his attitude towards Africans , and in some ways his views did differ from that of many liberals and other critics of colonialism .
for instance , he thought that Gabonese independence came too early , without adequate education or accommodation to local circumstances .
Edgar Ber@@ man quotes Schwe@@ itzer as having said in 1960 , &quot; No society can go from the prim@@ eval directly to an industrial state without losing the lea@@ ven@@ ing that time and an agricultural period allow . &quot; Schwe@@ itzer believed dignity and respect must be extended to blacks , while also sometimes characterizing them as children .
he summarized his views on European @-@ African relations by saying &quot; With regard to the neg@@ ro@@ es , then , I have coined the formula : &apos; I am your brother , it is true , but your elder brother . &apos; &quot; Chin@@ ua A@@ che@@ be has criticized him for this characterization , though A@@ che@@ be acknowledges that Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s use of the word &quot; brother &quot; at all was , for a European of the early 20th century , an unusual expression of human solidarity between Europeans and Africans .
Schwe@@ itzer eventually e@@ mended and complicated this notion with his later statement that &quot; The time for speaking of older and younger brothers has passed . &quot; later in life he became more convinced that &quot; modern civilization &quot; was actually inferior to or the same as previous cultures in terms of morality .
American journalist John Gun@@ ther visited Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é in the 1950s and reported Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s patron@@ izing attitude towards Africans .
he also noted the lack of Africans trained to be skilled workers .
by comparison , his contemporary Sir Albert Cook in Uganda had been training nurses and midwives since the 19@@ 10@@ s and had published a manual of midwifery in the local language of Lugan@@ da .
after three decades in Africa , Schwe@@ itzer still depended on Europe for nurses .
</p>
<p>
the journalist James Cameron visited Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é in 1953 and found significant flaws in the practices and attitudes of Schwe@@ itzer and his staff .
the hospital suffered from squal@@ or and was without modern amenities , and Schwe@@ itzer had little contact with the local people .
Cameron did not make public what he had seen at the time : according to a BBC dram@@ atisation , he made the unusual journalistic decision to withhold the story , and resisted the expressed wish of his employers to publish an ex@@ pos@@ é .
the poor conditions of the hospital in Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é were also famously criticized by Nigerian professor and novelist Chin@@ ua A@@ che@@ be in his essay on Joseph Conrad &apos;s novel &quot; Heart of Dar@@ kness &quot; :
&quot; in a comment which has often been quoted Schwe@@ itzer says : &apos; the African is indeed my brother but my junior brother . &apos; and so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being . &quot;

the keynote of Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s personal philosophy was the idea of &quot; Rever@@ ence for Life &quot; .
he thought that Western civilization was decaying because it had abandoned affirmation of life as its ethical foundation .
in the Pre@@ face to &quot; Civilization and Ethics &quot; he argued that Western philosophy from Des@@ car@@ tes to Kant had set out to explain the objective world expecting that humanity would be found to have a special meaning within it .
but no such meaning was found , and the rational , life @-@ affirming optimism of the Age of Enlightenment began to evaporate .
a rift opened between this world @-@ view , as material knowledge , and the life @-@ view , understood as Will , expressed in the pessimist philosophies from Sch@@ open@@ hau@@ er onward .
scientific materialism portrayed an objective world process devoid of ethics , entirely an expression of the will @-@ to @-@ live .
Schwe@@ itzer wrote , &quot; True philosophy must start from the most immediate and comprehensive fact of consciousness , and this may be formulated as follows : &apos; I am life which wills to live , and I exist in the midst of life which wills to live . &apos; &quot; in nature one form of life must always prey upon another .
however , human consciousness holds an awareness of , and sympathy for , the will of other beings to live .
an ethical human strives to escape from this contradiction so far as possible .
though we cannot perfect the endeavour we should strive for it : the will @-@ to @-@ live constantly renews itself , for it is both an evolutionary necessity and a spiritual phenomenon .
life and love are rooted in this same principle , in a personal spiritual relationship to the universe .
ethics themselves proceed from the need to respect the wish of other beings to exist as one does towards oneself .
even so , Schwe@@ itzer found many instances in world religions and philosophies in which the principle was denied , not least in the European Middle Ages , and in the Indian Brah@@ min@@ ic philosophy .
for Schwe@@ itzer , mankind had to accept that objective reality is ethically neutral .
it could then affirm a new Enlightenment through spiritual ration@@ alism , by giving priority to volition or ethical will as the primary meaning of life .
mankind had to choose to create the moral structures of civilization : the world @-@ view must derive from the life @-@ view , not vice versa .
respect for life , overcoming co@@ ar@@ ser impulses and hollow doctrines , leads the individual to live in the service of other people and of every living creature .
in contemplation of the will @-@ to @-@ life , respect for the life of others becomes the highest principle and the defining purpose of humanity .
such was the theory which Schwe@@ itzer sought to put into practice in his own life .
according to some authors , Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s thought , and specifically his development of reverence for life , was influenced by Indian religious thought and in particular the J@@ ain principle of a@@ him@@ sa , or non @-@ violence .
Albert Schwe@@ itzer noted the contribution of Indian influence in his book &quot; Indian Thought and Its Development &quot; :
the laying down of the commandment to not kill and to not damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind .
starting from its principle , founded on world and life denial , of abstention from action , ancient Indian thought - and this is a period when in other respects ethics have not progressed very far - reaches the tremendous discovery that ethics know no bounds .
so far as we know , this is for the first time clearly expressed by J@@ ain@@ ism .

after the birth of their daughter , Albert &apos;s wife , Hel@@ ene Schwe@@ itzer was no longer able to live in Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é due to her health .
in 1923 the family moved to Kö@@ nig@@ sfeld im Schwar@@ z@@ wald , Baden @-@ W@@ ür@@ tt@@ ember@@ g , where he was building a house for the family .
this house is now maintained as a Schwe@@ itzer museum .
from 1939 @-@ 48 he stayed in Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é , unable to go back to Europe because of the war .
three years after the end of World War II , in 1948 , he returned for the first time to Europe and kept traveling back and forth as long as he was able .
during his return visits to his home village of Gun@@ sb@@ ach , Schwe@@ itzer continued to make use of the family house , which after his death became an archive and museum to his life and work .
his life was portrayed in the 1952 movie &quot; Il est min@@ uit , Doc@@ teur Schwe@@ itzer &quot; , starring Pierre Fres@@ nay as Albert Schwe@@ itzer and Jeanne Mor@@ eau as his nurse Marie .
Schwe@@ itzer inspired actor Hugh O &apos;@@ Brian when O &apos;@@ Brian visited in Africa .
O &apos;@@ Brian returned to the United States and founded the Hugh O &apos;@@ Brian Youth Leadership Foundation .
Schwe@@ itzer was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize of 1952 , accepting the prize with the speech , &quot; The Problem of Peace . &quot; from 1952 until his death he worked against nuclear tests and nuclear weapons with Albert Einstein , Otto Ha@@ hn and Bertrand Russell .
in 1957 and 1958 he broadcast four speeches over Radio Oslo which were published in &quot; Peace or Atomic War &quot; .
in 1957 , Schwe@@ itzer was one of the founders of The Committee for a S@@ ane Nuclear Policy .
on 23 April 1957 , Schwe@@ itzer made his &quot; Declaration of Con@@ science &quot; speech ; it was broadcast to the world over Radio Oslo , pleading for the abolition of nuclear weapons .
his speech ended , &quot; The end of further experiments with atom bombs would be like the early sun@@ rays of hope which suffering humanity is longing for . &quot; weeks prior to his death , an American film crew was allowed to visit Schwe@@ itzer and Dr@@ s. Mun@@ tz and Friedman , both Holocaust survivors , to record his work and daily life at the hospital .
the film &quot; The Legacy of Albert Schwe@@ itzer &quot; , narrated by Henry Fon@@ da , was produced by Warner Brothers and aired once .
it resides in their vault today in deteriorating condition .
although several attempts have been made to restore and re @-@ air the film , all access has been denied .
in 1955 he was made an honorary member of the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II .
he was also a ch@@ ev@@ alier of the Military and Hospit@@ all@@ er Order of Saint Lazar@@ us of Jerusalem .
Schwe@@ itzer died on 4 September 1965 at his beloved hospital in Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é , now in independent Gabon .
his grave , on the banks of the O@@ go@@ ou@@ é River , is marked by a cross he made himself .
his cousin Anne @-@ Marie Schwe@@ itzer Sar@@ tre was the mother of Jean @-@ Paul Sar@@ tre .
her father , Charles Schwe@@ itzer , was the older brother of Albert Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s father , Louis Th@@ é@@ oph@@ ile .
Schwe@@ itzer was a veget@@ ari@@ an@@ .@@ However , in an account written by Dr. Edgar Ber@@ man , it is suggested that Schwe@@ itzer consumed fried liver at a Sunday dinner in Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é .
the Albert Schwe@@ itzer Fellowship was founded in 1940 by Schwe@@ itzer to unite US supporters in filling the gap in support for his Hospital when his European supply lines were cut off by war , and continues to support the Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é Hospital today .
Schwe@@ itzer , however , considered his ethic of Rever@@ ence for Life , not his Hospital , his most important legacy , saying that his Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é Hospital was just &quot; my own improvis@@ ation on the theme of Rever@@ ence for Life . everyone can have their own Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é . &quot; today AS@@ F helps large numbers of young Americans in health @-@ related professional fields find or create &quot; their own Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é &quot; in the US or internationally .
AS@@ F selects and supports nearly 250 new US and Africa Schwe@@ itzer Fellows each year from over 100 of the leading US schools of medicine , nursing , public health , and every other field with some relation to health .
the peer @-@ supporting lifelong network of &quot; Schwe@@ itzer Fellows for Life &quot; numbered over 2,000 members in 2008 , and is growing by nearly 1,000 every four years .
nearly 150 of these Schwe@@ itzer Fellows have served at the Hospital in Lam@@ bar@@ én@@ é , for three @-@ month periods during their last year of medical school .

the prize was first awarded on 29 May 2011 to Eu@@ gen Dre@@ wer@@ mann and the physician couple R@@ olf and Rap@@ ha@@ ela Mai@@ bach in Kö@@ nig@@ sfeld im Schwar@@ z@@ wald , where Schwe@@ itzer &apos;s former residence now houses the Albert Schwe@@ itzer Museum .
</p>
<p>
recordings of Schwe@@ itzer playing the music of Bach are available on CD .
during 1934 and 1935 he resided in Britain , delivering the Gif@@ ford Lec@@ tures at Edinburgh University , and those on &quot; Religion in Modern Civilization &quot; at Oxford and London .
he had originally conducted trials for recordings for H@@ MV on the organ of the old Queen &apos;s Hall in London .
these records did not satisfy him , the instrument being too harsh .
in mid @-@ December 1935 he began to record for Columbia Records on the organ of All H@@ allows , Bar@@ king @-@ by @-@ the @-@ Tower , London .
then at his suggestion the sessions were transferred to the church of St@@ e Aur@@ é@@ lie in Strasbourg , on a mid @-@ 18th @-@ century organ by Johann Andreas Sil@@ ber@@ mann , an organ @-@ builder greatly revered by Bach , which had been restored by the Lor@@ ra@@ ine organ @-@ builder Fr@@ édé@@ ric H@@ ä@@ r@@ p@@ fer shortly before the First World War .
these recordings were made in the course of a fortnight in October 1936 .
</p>
<p>
Schwe@@ itzer developed a technique for recording the performances of Bach &apos;s music .
known as &quot; The Schwe@@ itzer Technique , &quot; it is a slight improvement on what is commonly known as mid @-@ side .
the mid @-@ side sees a figure @-@ 8 microphone pointed off @-@ axis , perpendicular to the sound source .
then a single cardi@@ oid microphone is placed on axis , bis@@ ec@@ ting the figure @-@ 8 pattern .
the signal from the figure @-@ 8 is mul@@ t @-@ ed , p@@ anned hard left and right , one of the signals being flipped out of polarity .
in the Schwe@@ itzer method , the figure @-@ 8 is replaced by two small diaphragm condenser microphones pointed directly away from each other .
the information that each capsule collects is unique , unlike the identical out @-@ of @-@ polarity information generated from the figure @-@ 8 in a regular mid @-@ side .
the on @-@ axis microphone is often a large diaphragm condenser .
the technique has since been used to record many modern instruments .
</p>
<p>
altogether his early Columbia discs included 25 records of Bach and eight of Cé@@ sar Fran@@ ck .
the Bach titles were mainly distributed as follows : later recordings were made at Par@@ ish church , Gü@@ n@@ sb@@ ach :
these recordings were made by C. Robert Fine during the time Dr. Schwe@@ itzer was being filmed in Gü@@ n@@ sb@@ ach for the documentary &quot; Albert Schwe@@ itzer . &quot; fine originally self @-@ released the recordings but later licensed the masters to Columbia .
the above were released in the United States as Columbia Master@@ works boxed set SL @-@ 175 .

Alexis Carre@@ l was a French surgeon and biologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physi@@ ology or Medicine in 1912 for pioneering vascular su@@ turing techniques .
he invented the first perfusion pump with Charles A. Lind@@ ber@@ gh opening the way to organ transplantation .
like many intellectuals of his time , he promoted eu@@ gen@@ ics .
he was a reg@@ ent for the French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems during Vic@@ hy France which implemented the eu@@ gen@@ ics policies there ; his association with the Foundation and with Jacques D@@ ori@@ ot &apos;s ultra @-@ nationalist Parti Popul@@ aire Franç@@ ais led to investigations of collaborating with the Nazis , but he died before any trial could be held .
he faced media attacks towards the end of his life over his alleged involvement with the Nazis .
a Nobel Prize laureate in 1912 , Alexis Carre@@ l was also elected twice , in 1924 and 1927 , as an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR .
</p>
<p>
born in Sain@@ te @-@ Fo@@ y @-@ l@@ ès @-@ Lyon , Rh@@ ô@@ ne , Carre@@ l was raised in a devout Catholic family and was educated by Je@@ suits , though he had become an ag@@ nostic by the time he became a university student .
he was a pioneer in trans@@ plant@@ ology and thoracic surgery .
Alexis Carre@@ l was also a member of learned societies in the U.S. , Spain , Russia , Sweden , the Netherlands , Belgium , France , Vatican City , Germany , Italy and Greece and received honorary doc@@ torates from Queen &apos;s University of Belfast , Princeton University , California , New York , Brown University and Columbia University .
in 19@@ 02 , he was claimed to have witnessed the miraculous cure of Marie Bail@@ ly at Lour@@ des , made famous in part because she named Carre@@ l as a witness of her cure .
after the notori@@ ety surrounding the event , Carre@@ l could not obtain a hospital appointment because of the pervasive an@@ ticl@@ er@@ ic@@ alism in the French university system at the time .
in 1903 he emigrated to Montreal , Canada , but soon relocated to Chicago , Illinois to work for H@@ ull Laboratory .
while there he collaborated with American physician Charles Claude Gu@@ thri@@ e in work on vascular suture and the transplantation of blood vessels and organs as well as the head , and Carre@@ l was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physi@@ ology or Medicine for these efforts .
in 1906 he joined the newly formed Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in New York where he spent the rest of his career .
there he did significant work on tissue cultures with path@@ ologist Mon@@ tro@@ se Thomas Bur@@ rows .
in the 1930s , Carre@@ l and Charles Lind@@ ber@@ gh became close friends not only because of the years they worked together but also because they shared personal , political , and social views .
Lind@@ ber@@ gh initially sought out Carre@@ l to see if his sister @-@ in @-@ law &apos;s heart , damaged by rheumatic fever , could be repaired .
when Lind@@ ber@@ gh saw the cr@@ ud@@ eness of Carre@@ l &apos;s machinery , he offered to build new equipment for the scientist .
eventually they built the first perfusion pump , an invention instrumental to the development of organ transplantation and open heart surgery .
Lind@@ ber@@ gh considered Carre@@ l his closest friend , and said he would preserve and promote Carre@@ l &apos;s ideals after his death .
due to his close proximity with Jacques D@@ ori@@ ot &apos;s fascist Parti Popul@@ aire Franç@@ ais during the 1930s and his role in implementing eu@@ gen@@ ics policies during Vic@@ hy France , he was accused after the Liberation of collaboration , but died before the trial .
in his later life he returned to his Catholic roots .
in 1939 he met with Trap@@ p@@ ist monk Alexis Presse on a recommendation .
although Carre@@ l was skeptical about meeting with a priest , Presse ended up having a profound influence on the rest of Carre@@ l &apos;s life .
in 1942 , he said &quot; I believe in the existence of God , in the immortality of the soul , in R@@ evel@@ ation and in all the Catholic Church teaches . &quot; he summoned Presse to administer the Catholic Sacra@@ ments on his death bed in November 1944 .
for much of his life , Carre@@ l and his wife spent their summers on the , which they owned .
after he and Lind@@ ber@@ gh became close friends , Carre@@ l persuaded him to also buy a neighboring island , the I@@ le Il@@ li@@ ec , where the Lind@@ ber@@ ghs often resided in the late 1930s .
</p>
<p>
Carre@@ l was a young surgeon in 1894 , when the French president S@@ adi Car@@ not was assassinated with a knife .
Car@@ not bled to death due to sever@@ ing of his portal vein , and surgeons who treated the president felt that the vein could not be successfully re@@ connected .
this left a deep impression on Carre@@ l , and he set about developing new techniques for su@@ turing blood vessels .
the technique of &quot; triang@@ ulation , &quot; using three stay @-@ su@@ tures as traction points in order to minimize damage to the vascular wall during su@@ turing , was inspired by sewing lessons he took from an embro@@ ider@@ ess and is still used today .
Julius Com@@ ro@@ e wrote : &quot; between 1901 and 1910 , Alexis Carre@@ l , using experimental animals , performed every feat and developed every technique known to vascular surgery today . &quot; he had great success in re@@ connecting arteries and veins , and performing surgical grafts , and this led to his Nobel Prize in 1912 .
</p>
<p>
during World War I , Carre@@ l and the English chemist Henry Dr@@ ys@@ dale Dak@@ in developed the Carre@@ l @-@ Dak@@ in method of treating wounds based on chlorine which , preceding the development of antibiotics , was a major medical advance in the care of traumatic wounds .
for this , Carre@@ l was awarded the Lé@@ gi@@ on d &apos;@@ hon@@ ne@@ ur .
Carre@@ l also advocated the use of wound debri@@ de@@ ment and irrigation of wounds .
his method of wound irrigation involved flushing the tissues with a high volume of antiseptic fluid so that dirt and other contaminants would be washed away
</p>
<p>
Carre@@ l co @-@ authored a book with famed pilot Charles A. Lind@@ ber@@ gh , &quot; The Culture of Organs &quot; , and worked with Lind@@ ber@@ gh in the mid @-@ 1930s to create the &quot; perfusion pump , &quot; which allowed living organs to exist outside the body during surgery .
the advance is said to have been a crucial step in the development of open @-@ heart surgery and organ transplants , and to have laid the groundwork for the artificial heart , which became a reality decades later .
some critics of Lind@@ ber@@ gh claimed that Carre@@ l overstated Lind@@ ber@@ gh &apos;s role to gain media attention , but other sources say Lind@@ ber@@ gh played an important role in developing the device .
both Lind@@ ber@@ gh and Carre@@ l appeared on the cover of &quot; Time &quot; magazine on June 13 , 1938 .
</p>
<p>
Carre@@ l was also interested in the phenomenon of sen@@ escence , or aging .
he claimed that all cells continued to grow indefinitely , and this became a dominant view in the early 20th century .
Carre@@ l started an experiment on January 17 , 1912 , where he placed tissue cultured from an embryonic chicken heart in a stop@@ pered Py@@ rex flask of his own design .
he maintained the living culture for over 20 years with regular supplies of nutrient .
this was longer than a chicken &apos;s normal lifespan .
the experiment , which was conducted at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , attracted considerable popular and scientific attention .
Carre@@ l &apos;s experiment by some was never successfully replicated , and in the 1960s Leonard Hay@@ flick and Paul Mo@@ or@@ head proposed that differentiated cells can undergo only a limited number of divisions before dying .
this is known as the Hay@@ flick limit , and is now a pillar of biology .
L. Hay@@ flick has shown that a cell has a limited number of divisions , equal to the so called &quot; Hay@@ flick &apos;s Limit . &quot; however , L. Fran@@ ks and others , have shown that the number of cell divisions can be considerably greater than that stipulated by the &quot; Hay@@ flick Limit , &quot; having practically no limit at all .
it is not certain how Carre@@ l obtained his anomalous results .
Leonard Hay@@ flick suggests that the daily feeding of nutrient was continually introducing new living cells to the alleged immortal culture .
J. A. Wit@@ k@@ owski has argued that , while &quot; immortal &quot; strains of visibly mut@@ ated cells have been obtained by other experi@@ men@@ ters , a more likely explanation is deliberate introduction of new cells into the culture , possibly without Carre@@ l &apos;s knowledge .
</p>
<p>
in 1972 , the Swedish Post Office honored Carre@@ l with a stamp that was part of its Nobel stamp series .
in 1979 , the lunar crater Carre@@ l was named after him as a tribute to his scientific breakthroughs .
in February 2002 , as part of celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Charles Lind@@ ber@@ gh &apos;s birth , the Medical University of South Carolina at Charl@@ eston established the Lind@@ ber@@ gh @-@ Carre@@ l Prize , given to major contributors to &quot; development of perfusion and bi@@ ore@@ actor technologies for organ preservation and growth . &quot; Michael De@@ Ba@@ key and nine other scientists received the prize , a bronze statu@@ ette &#91; http :
/ / www.@@ fon@@ daz@@ ion@@ ec@@ ar@@ rel@@ .org / car@@ rel / 1.@@ htm &#93; created for the event by the Italian artist C. Z@@ oli and named &quot; Elisabeth &quot; after Elisabeth Mor@@ row , sister of Lind@@ ber@@ gh &apos;s wife Anne Mor@@ row , who died from heart disease .
it was in fact Lind@@ ber@@ gh &apos;s disappointment that contemporary medical technology could not provide an artificial heart pump which would allow for heart surgery on her that led to Lind@@ ber@@ gh &apos;s first contact with Carre@@ l .
</p>
<p>
in 19@@ 02 Alexis Carre@@ l went from being a skep@@ tic of the visions and miracles reported at Lour@@ des to being a believer in spiritual cures after experiencing a healing of Marie Bail@@ ly that he could not explain .
the Catholic journal &quot; Le nou@@ vel@@ list@@ e &quot; reported that she named him as the prime witness of her cure .
Alexis Carre@@ l refused to discount a supernatural explanation and steadfastly reiterated his beliefs , even writing the book &quot; The Voy@@ age to Lour@@ des &quot; describing his experience , although it was not published until four years after his death .
this was a detriment to his career and reputation among his fellow doctors , and feeling he had no future in academic medicine in France , he emigrated to Canada with the intention of farming and raising cattle .
after a brief period , he accepted an appointment at the University of Chicago and two years later at the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research .
</p>
<p>
in 1935 , Carre@@ l published a book titled &quot; L &apos;@@ Hom@@ me , c@@ et in@@ con@@ nu &quot; , which became a best @-@ seller .
in the book , he attempted to outline a comprehensive account what is known and more importantly unknown of the human body and human life &quot; in light of discoveries in biology , physics , and medicine , &quot; to elucidate problems of the modern world , and to provide possible routes to a better life for human beings .
for Carre@@ l , the fundamental problem was that : &#91; m &#93; en cannot follow modern civilization along its present course , because they are de@@ generating .
they have been fascinated by the beauty of the sciences of inert matter .
they have not understood that their body and consciousness are subjected to natural laws , more obscure than , but as inexorable as , the laws of the si@@ der@@ eal world .
neither have they understood that they cannot trans@@ gress these laws without being punished .
they must , therefore , learn the necessary relations of the cosmic universe , of their fellow men , and of their inner selves , and also those of their tissues and their mind .
indeed , man stands above all things .
should he degenerate , the beauty of civilization , and even the grandeur of the physical universe , would vanish . ...
humanity &apos;s attention must turn from the machines of the world of inanimate matter to the body and the soul of man , to the organic and mental processes which have created the machines and the universe of Newton and Einstein .
Car@@ rell advocated , in part , that mankind could better itself by following the guidance of an elite group of intellectuals , and by incorporating eu@@ gen@@ ics into the social framework .
he argued for an aristocracy springing from individuals of potential , writing :
we must single out the children who are endowed with high potentialities , and develop them as completely as possible .
and in this manner give to the nation a non @-@ hereditary aristocracy .
such children may be found in all classes of society , although distinguished men appear more frequently in distinguished families than in others .
the descendants of the founders of American civilization may still possess the ancestral qualities .
these qualities are generally hidden under the cloak of degeneration .
but this degeneration is often superficial .
it comes chiefly from education , idleness , lack of responsibility and moral discipline .
the sons of very rich men , like those of criminals , should be removed while still infants from their natural surroundings .
thus separated from their family , they could manifest their hereditary strength .
in the aristocratic families of Europe there are also individuals of great vitality .
the issue of the Crus@@ aders is by no means extinct .
the laws of genetics indicate the probability that the legendary audacity and love of adventure can appear again in the lineage of the feudal lords .
it is possible also that the offspring of the great criminals who had imagination , courage , and judgment , of the heroes of the French or Russian Rev@@ olutions , of the high @-@ handed business men who live among us , might be excellent building stones for an enterprising minority .
as we know , criminality is not hereditary if not united with feeble @-@ mindedness or other mental or cerebral defects .
high potentialities are rarely encountered in the sons of honest , intelligent , hard @-@ working men who have had ill luck in their careers , who have failed in business or have mud@@ dled along all their lives in inferior positions .
or among peasants living on the same spot for centuries .
however , from such people sometimes spring artists , poets , adven@@ turers , saints .
a brilliantly gifted and well @-@ known New York family came from peasants who cultivated their farm in the south of France from the time of Char@@ lem@@ agne to that of Napoleon .
Carre@@ l advocated the use of g@@ asses to rid humanity of &quot; defec@@ tives , &quot; thus endorsing the scientific racism discourse .
his endorsement of this idea began in the mid @-@ 1930s , prior to the Nazi implementation of such practices in Germany .
in the 1936 German introduction of his book , at the publisher &apos;s request , he added the following praise of the Nazi regime which did not appear in the editions in other languages : he German government has taken energetic measures against the propagation of the defective , the mentally diseased , and the criminal .
the ideal solution would be the suppression of each of these individuals as soon as he has proven himself to be dangerous .
for the insane and the criminal , he endorsed the use of g@@ assing for euthanasia : he conditioning of petty criminals with the whip , or some more scientific procedure , followed by a short stay in hospital , would probably suffice to insure order .
those who have murdered , robbed while armed with automatic pistol or machine gun , kidnapped children , despo@@ iled the poor of their savings , misled the public in important matters , should be humanely and economically disposed of in small euthan@@ as@@ ic institutions supplied with proper g@@ asses .
a similar treatment could be advant@@ ag@@ eously applied to the insane , guilty of criminal acts .
otherwise he endorsed voluntary positive eu@@ gen@@ ics .
he wrote : we have mentioned that natural selection has not played its part for a long while .
that many inferior individuals have been conserved through the efforts of hygiene and medicine .
but we cannot prevent the reproduction of the weak when they are neither insane nor criminal .
or destroy sickly or defective children as we do the weak@@ lings in a litter of puppies .
the only way to obviate the disastrous predominance of the weak is to develop the strong .
our efforts to render normal the unfit are evidently useless .
we should , then , turn our attention toward promoting the optimum growth of the fit .
by making the strong still stronger , we could effectively help the weak ;
for the herd always profits by the ideas and inventions of the elite .
instead of leveling organic and mental inequalities , we should amplify them and construct greater men .
he continued : the progress of the strong depends on the conditions of their development and the possibility left to parents of transmitting to their offspring the qualities which they have acquired in the course of their existence .
modern society must , therefore , allow to all a certain stability of life , a home , a garden , some friends .
children must be reared in contact with things which are the expression of the mind of their parents .
it is imperative to stop the transformation of the farmer , the artisan , the artist , the professor , and the man of science into manual or intellectual prolet@@ arians , possessing nothing but their hands or their brains .
the development of this proletariat will be the everlasting shame of industrial civilization .
it has contributed to the disappearance of the family as a social unit , and to the weakening of intelligence and moral sense .
it is destroying the remains of culture .
all forms of the proletariat must be suppressed .
each individual should have the security and the stability required for the foundation of a family .
marriage must cease being only a temporary union .
the union of man and woman , like that of the higher anthropo@@ ids , ought to last at least until the young have no further need of protection .
the laws relating to education , and especially to that of girls , to marriage , and divorce should , above all , take into account the interest of children .
women should receive a higher education , not in order to become doctors , lawyers , or professors , but to rear their offspring to be valuable human beings .
the free practice of eu@@ gen@@ ics could lead not only to the development of stronger individuals , but also of strains endowed with more endurance , intelligence , and courage .
these strains should constitute an aristocracy , from which great men would probably appear .
modern society must promote , by all possible means , the formation of better human stock .
no financial or moral rewards should be too great for those who , through the wisdom of their marriage , would engender geni@@ uses .
the complexity of our civilization is immense .
no one can master all its mechanisms .
however , these mechanisms have to be mastered .
there is need today of men of larger mental and moral size , capable of accomplishing such a task .
the establishment of a hereditary biological aristocracy through voluntary eu@@ gen@@ ics would be an important step toward the solution of our present problems .

in 1937 , Carre@@ l joined Jean C@@ out@@ rot &apos;s &quot; Centre d &apos;E@@ tudes des Probl@@ è@@ mes Hum@@ ains &quot; - C@@ out@@ rot &apos;s aim was to develop what he called an &quot; economic humanism &quot; through &quot; collective thinking . &quot; in 1941 , through connections to the cabinet of Vic@@ hy France president Philippe Pé@@ tain he went on to advocate for the creation of the &quot; Fondation Franç@@ aise pour l &apos;E@@ tude des Probl@@ è@@ mes Hum@@ ains &quot; which was created by decree of the Vic@@ hy regime in 1941 , and where he served as &apos; reg@@ ent &apos; .
the foundation was at the origin of the October 11 , 1946 , law , enacted by the Provisional Government of the French Republic , which institutionalized the field of occupational medicine .
it worked on demographics , on economics , , on nutrition , on habitation and on the first opinion polls .
&quot; the foundation was chartered as a public institution under the joint supervision of the ministries of finance and public health . it was given financial autonomy and a budget of forty million francs - roughly one franc per inhabitant - a true luxury considering the burdens imposed by the German Occupation on the nation &apos;s resources . by way of comparison , the whole Centre National de la Rec@@ her@@ che Scienti@@ fi@@ que was given a budget of fifty million francs . &quot; the Foundation made many positive accomplishments during its time .
yet it was also behind the origin of the December 16 , 1942 Act inventing the &quot; pren@@ uptial certificate , &quot; which had to precede any marriage and was supposed , after a biological examination , to insure the &quot; good health &quot; of the spouses , in particular in regard to sexually transmitted diseases and &quot; life hygiene &quot; .
the institute also conceived the &quot; scholar book &quot; , which could be used to record students &apos; grades in the French secondary schools , and thus classify and select them according to scholastic performance .

Anat@@ ole France was a French poet , journalist , and successful novelist with several best @-@ sellers .
ironic and skeptical , he was considered in his day the ideal French man of letters .
he was a member of the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie franç@@ aise , and won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot; in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements , characterized as they are by a nobility of style , a profound human sympathy , grace , and a true Gall@@ ic temperament . &quot; France is also widely believed to be the model for narrator Marcel &apos;s literary idol Ber@@ got@@ te in Marcel Prou@@ st &apos;s &quot; In Search of Lost Time &quot; .
</p>
<p>
the son of a book@@ seller , France spent most of his life around books and was a bibli@@ oph@@ ile .
his father &apos;s bookstore , called the &quot; Li@@ bra@@ irie France &quot; , specialized in books and papers on the French Revolution and was frequented by many notable writers and scholars of the day .
France studied at the Col@@ l@@ è@@ ge Stan@@ isl@@ as , a private Catholic school , and after graduation he helped his father by working in his bookstore .
after several years he secured the position of catalo@@ gu@@ er at Bachel@@ ine @-@ Def@@ lor@@ enne and at L@@ emer@@ re .
in 18@@ 76 he was appointed librarian for the French Senate .
</p>
<p>
France began his literary career as a poet and a journalist .
in 18@@ 69 , &quot; Le Par@@ nas@@ se Con@@ tempor@@ ain &quot; published one of his poems , &quot; La Part de Madeleine . &quot; in 18@@ 75 , he sat on the committee which was in charge of the third &quot; Par@@ nas@@ se Con@@ tempor@@ ain &quot; compilation .
as a journalist , from 1867 , he wrote many articles and notices .
he became famous with the novel &quot; Le Crime de Syl@@ ve@@ stre B@@ onn@@ ard &quot; .
its protagonist , skeptical old scholar Syl@@ v@@ ester B@@ onn@@ ard , embodied France &apos;s own personality .
the novel was praised for its elegant prose and won him a prize from the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie franç@@ aise .
in &quot; La R@@ oti@@ s@@ ser@@ ie de la Re@@ ine Ped@@ au@@ que &quot; France ridicul@@ ed belief in the occult ; and in &quot; Les Opinions de J@@ ér@@ ôme Co@@ ign@@ ard &quot; , France captured the atmosphere of the &quot; fin de si@@ è@@ cle &quot; .
he was elected to the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie franç@@ aise in 1896 .
France took an important part in the Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us affair .
he signed É@@ mile Z@@ ola &apos;s manifesto supporting Alfred Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us , a Jewish army officer who had been falsely convicted of espionage .
France wrote about the affair in his 1901 novel &quot; Monsieur Ber@@ ger@@ et &quot; .
France &apos;s later works include &quot; L &apos;@@ Î@@ le des Ping@@ ou@@ ins &quot; which sati@@ ri@@ zes human nature by depicting the transformation of penguins into humans - after the animals have been baptized by mistake by the near@@ sighted Ab@@ bot Ma@@ el .
it is a sati@@ rical history of France , starting in Medi@@ eval times , going on to the writer &apos;s own time with special attention to the Dre@@ y@@ f@@ us affair and concluding with a dy@@ stop@@ ian future . &quot;
Les di@@ eux ont so@@ if &quot; is a novel , set in Paris during the French Revolution , about a true @-@ believing follower of Maxim@@ ili@@ en Rob@@ es@@ pier@@ re and his contribution to the bloody events of the Re@@ ign of Terror of 17@@ 93 @-@ 94 .
it is a wake @-@ up call against political and ideological fanaticism and explores various other philosophical approaches to the events of the time . &quot;
La Rev@@ ol@@ te des An@@ ges &quot; is often considered Anat@@ ole France &apos;s most profound and ironic novel .
loosely based on the Christian understanding of the War in Heaven , it tells the story of Ar@@ cade , the guardian angel of Maurice d &apos;E@@ spar@@ vi@@ eu .
bored because Bishop d &apos;E@@ spar@@ vi@@ eu is sin@@ less , Ar@@ cade begins reading the bishop &apos;s books on theology and becomes an athe@@ ist .
he moves to Paris , meets a woman , falls in love , and loses his virginity causing his wings to fall off , joins the revolutionary movement of angels , and meets the Devil , who realizes that if he overthrew God , he would become just like God .
arcade realizes that replacing God with another is meaningless unless &quot; in ourselves and in ourselves alone we attack and destroy I@@ al@@ dab@@ ao@@ th . &quot; &quot; I@@ al@@ dab@@ ao@@ th , &quot; according to France , is God &apos;s secret name and means &quot; the child who w@@ anders . &quot; he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 .
he died in 1924 and is buried in the Neu@@ illy @-@ sur @-@ Seine community cemetery near Paris .
on 31 May 1922 , France &apos;s entire works were put on the &quot; Index Libr@@ orum Prohi@@ bit@@ orum &quot; of the Catholic Church .
he regarded this as a &quot; distinction . &quot; this Index was abolished in 1966 .
</p>
<p>
in 18@@ 77 , France married Val@@ é@@ rie Gu@@ ér@@ in de Sau@@ ville , a granddaughter of Jean @-@ Ur@@ ba@@ in Gu@@ ér@@ in a mini@@ atur@@ ist who painted Louis XVI , and with whom he had a daughter , Suzanne , in 18@@ 81 .
France &apos;s relations with women were always turbulent , and in 1888 he began a relationship with Madame Ar@@ man de C@@ ail@@ lav@@ et , who conducted a celebrated literary salon of the Third Republic ; the affair lasted until shortly before her death in 1910 .
after his divorce in 18@@ 93 , he had many lia@@ isons , notably with Mme Gag@@ ey , who committed suicide in 1911 .
France married again in 1920 , to Emma Lap@@ ré@@ v@@ otte .
politically , France was a socialist and an outspoken supporter of the 1917 Russian Revolution .
in 1920 , he gave his support to the newly founded French Communist Party .
France was documented to have a brain size just three @-@ quarters the average weight .
</p>
<p>
after his death in 1924 France was the object of written attacks , including particularly venomous assaults from the Nazi collabor@@ ator Pierre Dri@@ eu La Ro@@ ch@@ elle , and the Sur@@ re@@ alists , who published &quot; U@@ n Cad@@ av@@ re &quot; largely as a response to the popular appeal of France , who they deemed vulgar and derivative .
an admirer , the English writer George Or@@ well , defended him however and declared that he remained very readable , and that &quot; it is unquestionable that he was attacked partly from political motive . &quot;
</p>
<p>
André Paul Guillaume G@@ ide was a French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature .
G@@ ide &apos;s career ranged from its beginnings in the symbol@@ ist movement , to the advent of antic@@ ol@@ onialism between the two World Wars .
the author of more than fifty books , at the time of his death his ob@@ itu@@ ary in &quot; The New York Times &quot; described him as &quot; France &apos;s greatest contemporary man of letters &quot; and &quot; judged the greatest French writer of this century by the literary co@@ g@@ no@@ sc@@ enti . &quot; known for his fiction as well as his autobi@@ ographical works , G@@ ide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation of the two sides of his personality , which a strict and mor@@ alistic education had helped set at odds .
G@@ ide &apos;s work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of mor@@ alistic and pur@@ itan@@ ical constraints , and centres on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty .
his self @-@ exploratory texts reflect his search of how to be fully oneself , including owning one &apos;s sexual nature , without at the same time betra@@ ying one &apos;s values .
his political activity is shaped by the same ethos , as indicated by his repudiation of communism after his 1936 voyage to the USSR .
</p>
<p>
G@@ ide was born in Paris on 22 November 18@@ 69 , into a middle @-@ class Protestant family .
his father was a Paris University professor of law who died in 1880 .
his uncle was the political economist Charles G@@ ide .
his paternal family traced its roots back to Italy , with his ancestors , the Guid@@ o &apos;s , moving to France and other western and northern European countries after converting to Prote@@ stan@@ tism during the 16th century , due to persecution .
G@@ ide was brought up in isolated conditions in Normandy and became a prolific writer at an early age , publishing his first novel , &quot; The Not@@ e@@ books of André Walter &quot; , in 18@@ 91 , at the age of twenty @-@ one .
in 18@@ 93 and 1894 , G@@ ide travelled in Northern Africa , and it was there that he came to accept his attraction to boys .
he be@@ fri@@ ended Oscar Wil@@ de in Paris , and in 18@@ 95 G@@ ide and Wil@@ de met in Algiers .
Wil@@ de had the impression that he had introduced G@@ ide to homosexuality , but , in fact , G@@ ide had already discovered this on his own .
</p>
<p>
in 18@@ 95 , after his mother &apos;s death , he married his cousin Madeleine Ron@@ deaux , but the marriage remained un@@ consum@@ mated .
in 1896 , he became mayor of La Ro@@ que @-@ Ba@@ ign@@ ard , a commune in Normandy .
in 1901 , G@@ ide rented the property Mad@@ eria in St. Br@@ él@@ ade &apos;s Bay and lived there while residing in Jersey .
this period , 1901 @-@ 07 , is commonly seen as a time of apathy and turmoil for him .
in 1908 , G@@ ide helped found the literary magazine &quot; Nou@@ vel@@ le Revue Franç@@ aise &quot; .
in 1916 , Marc All@@ é@@ gre@@ t , only 15 years old , became his lover .
Marc was the son - one of five children - of E@@ lie All@@ é@@ gre@@ t , who years before had been hired by G@@ ide &apos;s mother to tutor her son in light of his weak grades in school , after which he and G@@ ide became fast friends ; All@@ é@@ gre@@ t was best man at G@@ ide &apos;s wedding .
G@@ ide and Marc fled to London , in retribution for which his wife burned all his correspondence - &quot; the best part of myself , &quot; he later commented .
in 1918 , he met Dorothy Bus@@ sy , who was his friend for over thirty years and translated many of his works into English .
in the 1920s , G@@ ide became an inspiration for writers such as Albert Cam@@ us and Jean @-@ Paul Sar@@ tre .
in 1923 , he published a book on F@@ y@@ odor Do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky ; however , when he defended homosexuality in the public edition of &quot; Cor@@ y@@ don &quot; he received widespread condemnation .
he later considered this his most important work .
in 1923 , he si@@ red a daughter , Catherine , by Elisabeth van R@@ ys@@ sel@@ ber@@ ghe , a woman who was much younger than he .
he had known her for a long time , as she was the daughter of his closest female friend , Maria M@@ onn@@ om , the wife of his friend the Belgian neo @-@ impres@@ sionist painter Th@@ é@@ o van R@@ ys@@ sel@@ ber@@ ghe .
this caused the only crisis in the long @-@ standing relationship between All@@ é@@ gre@@ t and G@@ ide and damaged the relation with van R@@ ys@@ sel@@ ber@@ ghe .
this was possibly G@@ ide &apos;s only sexual liaison with a woman , and it was brief in the extreme .
Catherine became his only descendant by blood .
he liked to call Elisabeth &quot; La Dame Blan@@ che &quot; .
Elisabeth eventually left her husband to move to Paris and manage the practical aspects of G@@ ide &apos;s life .
she worshi@@ ped him , but evidently they no longer had a sexual relationship .
G@@ ide &apos;s legal wife , Madeleine , died in 1938 .
later he explored their un@@ consum@@ mated marriage in his memoir of Madeleine , &quot; E@@ t Nun@@ c Man@@ et in Te &quot; .
in 1924 , he published an autobiography , &quot; If it Die ... &quot; .
in the same year , he produced the first French language editions of Joseph Conrad &apos;s &quot; Heart of Dar@@ kness &quot; and &quot; Lord Jim &quot; .
after 1925 , he began to campaign for more humane conditions for convicted criminals .
</p>
<p>
from July 1926 to May 1927 , he travelled through the French Equatorial Africa colony with his lover Marc All@@ é@@ gre@@ t .
G@@ ide went successively to Middle Congo , U@@ ban@@ gi @-@ Shari , briefly to Chad and then to Cameroon before returning to France .
he related his per@@ egr@@ inations in a journal called &quot; Trav@@ els in the Congo &quot; and &quot; Return from Chad &quot; .
in this published journal , he criticized the behavior of French business interests in the Congo and inspired reform .
in particular , he strongly criticized the &quot; Large Conc@@ essions &quot; regime , &quot; i.e. , &quot; a regime according to which part of the colony was conceded to French companies and where these companies could exploit all of the area &apos;s natural resources , in particular rubber .
he related , for instance , how natives were forced to leave their village for several weeks to collect rubber in the forest , and went as far as comparing their exploitation to slavery .
the book had important influence on anti @-@ colonialism movements in France and helped re @-@ evaluate the impact of colonialism .
</p>
<p>
during the 1930s , he briefly became a communist , or more precisely , a fellow traveler .
as a distinguished writer sympath@@ izing with the cause of communism , he was invited to speak at Max@@ im Gor@@ ky &apos;s funeral and to tour the Soviet Union as a guest of the Soviet Union of Writers .
he encountered censorship of his speeches and was particularly disillusioned with the state of culture under Soviet communism , breaking with his socialist friends in &quot; Re@@ tour de L &apos;@@ U.@@ R.@@ S.@@ S. &quot; in 1936 .
then would it not be better to , instead of playing on words , simply to acknowledge that the revolutionary spirit is no longer the correct thing , that it is not wanted any more ?
what is wanted now is compliance , con@@ form@@ ism .
what is desired and demanded is approval of all that is done in the U. S. S. R. ; and an attempt is being made to obtain an approval that is not mere resignation , but a sincere , an enthusiastic approval .
what is most astounding is that this attempt is successful .
on the other hand the smallest protest , the least criticism , is liable to the sever@@ est penalties , and in fact is immediately stifled .
and I doubt whether in any other country in the world , even Hitler &apos;s Germany , thought to be less free , more bowed down , more fearful , more v@@ ass@@ alized .
in the 1949 anth@@ ology &quot; The God That F@@ ailed &quot; G@@ ide describes his early enthusiasm :
my faith in communism is like my faith in religion : it is a promise of salvation for mankind .
if I have to lay my life down that it may succeed , I would do so without hesitation .
it is impermissible under any circumstances for morals to sink as low as communism has done .
no one can begin to imagine the tragedy of humanity , of morality , of religion and of freedoms in the land of communism , where man has been de@@ based beyond belief .
</p>
<p>
in 1930 G@@ ide published a book about the Blan@@ che M@@ onn@@ ier case called &quot; La Sé@@ que@@ str@@ ée de Po@@ iti@@ ers &quot; , changing little but the names of the protagonists .
M@@ onn@@ ier was a young woman who was kept captive by her own mother for more than 25 years .
in 1939 , G@@ ide became the first living author to be published in the prestigious &quot; Bi@@ bl@@ io@@ th@@ è@@ que de la Pl@@ é@@ i@@ ade &quot; .
he left France for Africa in 1942 and lived in Tunis until the end of World War II .
in 1947 , he received the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot; for his comprehensive and artis@@ tically significant writings , in which human problems and conditions have been presented with a fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight . &quot; he devoted much of his last years to publishing his Journal .
G@@ ide died in Paris on 19 February 1951 .
the Roman Catholic Church placed his works on the &quot; Index of Forbidden Books &quot; in 1952 .
</p>
<p>
G@@ ide &apos;s bi@@ ographer Alan Sher@@ idan summed up G@@ ide &apos;s life as a writer and an intellectual :
G@@ ide was , by general consent , one of the dozen most important writers of the 20th century .
moreover , no writer of such stature had led such an interesting life , a life acces@@ sibly interesting to us as readers of his autobi@@ ographical writings , his journal , his voluminous correspondence and the testimony of others .
it was the life of a man engaging not only in the business of artistic creation , but reflecting on that process in his journal , reading that work to his friends and discussing it with them ; a man who knew and corresponded with all the major literary figures of his own country and with many in Germany and England ; who found daily nourishment in the Latin , French , English and German classics , and , for much of his life , in the Bible ;
&#91; who enjoyed playing Chop@@ in and other classic works on the piano ;
&#93; and who engaged in commenting on the moral , political and sexual questions of the day .
&quot; G@@ ide &apos;s fame rested ultimately , of course , on his literary works . but , unlike many writers , he was no recl@@ use : he had a need of friendship and a genius for sustaining it . &quot; but his &quot; capacity for love was not confined to his friends : it spilled over into a concern for others less fortunate than himself . &quot;
</p>
<p>
G@@ ide &apos;s surviving letters run into the thousands . but it is the &quot; Journal &quot; that Sher@@ idan calls &quot; the pre @-@ eminently Gide@@ an mode of expression . &quot;
&quot; his first novel emerged from G@@ ide &apos;s own journal , and many of the first @-@ person narratives read more or less like journals .
in &quot; Les f@@ aux @-@ mon@@ n@@ ay@@ eurs &quot; , E@@ dou@@ ard &apos;s journal provides an alternative voice to the narrator &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; in 1946 , when Pierre Herbert asked G@@ ide which of his books he would choose if only one were to survive , &quot; G@@ ide replied , &apos; I think it would be my &quot; Journal . &quot;
&apos; &quot; beginning at the age of eighteen or nineteen , G@@ ide kept a journal all of his life and when these were first made available to the public , they ran to thirteen hundred pages .
</p>
<p>
&quot; each volume that G@@ ide wrote was intended to challenge itself , what had preceded it , and what could conceivably follow it . this characteristic , according to Daniel M@@ out@@ ote in his &quot; Ca@@ hi@@ ers de André G@@ ide &quot; essay , is what makes G@@ ide &apos;s work &apos; essentially modern &apos; : the &apos; perpetual renewal of the values by which one lives . &apos; &quot; G@@ ide wrote in his &quot; Journal &quot; in 1930 :
&quot; the only drama that really interests me and that I should always be willing to depict anew , is the debate of the individual with whatever keeps him from being authentic , with whatever is opposed to his integrity , to his integration . most often the obstacle is within him . and all the rest is merely accidental . &quot; as a whole , &quot; The works of André G@@ ide reveal his passionate revolt against the restraints and conventions inherited from 19th @-@ century France . he sought to uncover the authentic self beneath its contradictory masks . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in his journal , G@@ ide distinguishes between adult @-@ attracted &quot; so@@ dom@@ ites &quot; and boy @-@ loving &quot; pe@@ der@@ asts , &quot; categorizing himself as the latter .
I call a pe@@ der@@ ast the man who , as the word indicates , falls in love with young boys .
I call a so@@ dom@@ ite the man whose desire is addressed to mature men . &#91; ... &#93;
the pe@@ der@@ asts , of whom I am one , are much r@@ arer , and the so@@ dom@@ ites much more numerous , than I first thought . &#91; ... &#93;
that such loves can spring up , that such relationships can be formed , it is not enough for me to say that this is natural ; I maintain that it is good ; each of the two finds exal@@ tation , protection , a challenge in them ; and I wonder whether it is for the youth or the elder man that they are more profitable .
in the company of Oscar Wil@@ de , he had several sexual encounters with young boys abroad .
Wil@@ de took a key out of his pocket and showed me into a tiny apartment of two rooms ...
the youths followed him , each of them wrapped in a burn@@ ous that hid his face .
then the guide left us and Wil@@ de sent me into the further room with little Mohammed and shut himself up in the other with the &#91; other boy &#93; .
every time since then that I have sought after pleasure , it is the memory of that night I have pursued . &#91; ... &#93;
my joy was un@@ bounded , and I cannot imagine it greater , even if love had been added .
how should there have been any question of love ?
how should I have allowed desire to dispose of my heart ?
no scru@@ ple clouded my pleasure and no remorse followed it .

Abner Dou@@ bl@@ eday was a career United States Army officer and Union 2 @-@ star general in the American Civil War .
he fired the first shot in defense of Fort Sum@@ ter , the opening battle of the war , and had a pivotal role in the early fighting at the Battle of Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg .
Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg was his finest hour , but his relief by Maj@@ . Gen. George G. Me@@ ade caused lasting enmity between the two men .
in San Francisco , after the war , he obtained a patent on the cable car railway that still runs there .
in his final years in New Jersey , he was a prominent member and later president of the The@@ os@@ oph@@ ical Society .
in 1908 , fifteen years after his death , Dou@@ bl@@ eday was declared by the Mills Commission to have invented the game of baseball .
this claim has been thoroughly deb@@ un@@ ked by baseball historians .
</p>
<p>
Dou@@ bl@@ eday , the son of Ul@@ ys@@ ses F. Dou@@ bl@@ eday and Hester D@@ onn@@ elly , was born in Ball@@ ston S@@ pa , New York , in a small house on the corner of Washington and Fen@@ wick streets .
as a child , Abner was very short .
the family all slept in the attic loft of the one @-@ room house .
his paternal grandfather , also named Abner , had fought in the American Revolutionary War .
his maternal grandfather Thomas D@@ onn@@ elly joined the army at 14 and was a mounted messenger for George Washington .
his great grandfather Peter D@@ onn@@ elly was a Min@@ ut@@ eman .
his father , Ul@@ ys@@ ses F. , fought in the War of 18@@ 12 , published newspapers and books , and represented Au@@ burn , New York for four years in the United States Congress .
Abner spent his childhood in Au@@ burn and later was sent to Cooper@@ stown to live with his uncle and attend a private preparatory high school .
he practiced as a surveyor and civil engineer for two years before entering the United States Military Academy in 18@@ 38 .
he graduated in 18@@ 42 , 24th in a class of 56 cadets , and was commissioned a bre@@ vet second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Ar@@ tillery .
in 18@@ 52 , he married Mary Hew@@ itt of Baltimore , the daughter of a local lawyer .
</p>
<p>
Dou@@ bl@@ eday initially served in coastal gar@@ ris@@ ons and then in the Mexican @-@ American War from 18@@ 46 to 1848 and the Semin@@ ole Wars from 18@@ 56 to 18@@ 58 .
in 18@@ 58 he was transferred to Fort M@@ oul@@ tri@@ e in Charl@@ eston Harbor serving under Colonel John L. Gardner .
by the start of the Civil War , he was a captain and second in command in the garrison at Fort Sum@@ ter , under Major Robert Anderson .
he aimed the cannon that fired the first return shot in answer to the Confederate bombardment on April 12 , 1861 .
he subsequently referred to himself as the &quot; hero of Sum@@ ter &quot; for this role .
</p>
<p>
Dou@@ bl@@ eday was promoted to major on May 14 , 1861 , and commanded the Ar@@ tillery Department in the Shen@@ an@@ do@@ ah Valley from June to August , and then the artillery for Major General Na@@ than@@ iel Banks &apos;s division of the Army of the Pot@@ om@@ ac .
he was appointed bri@@ gadier general of volunteers on February 3 , 18@@ 62 , and was assigned to duty in northern Virginia while the Army of the Pot@@ om@@ ac conducted the Peninsula Campaign .
his first combat assignment was to lead the 2nd Brigade , 1st Division , III Corps of the Army of Virginia during the Northern Virginia Campaign .
in the actions at Bra@@ w@@ ner &apos;s farm , just before the Second Battle of Bull Run , he took the initiative to send two of his regi@@ ments to reinforce Brigadier General John Gib@@ bon &apos;s brigade against a larger Confederate force , fighting it to a standstill .
his men were routed when they encountered Major General James Long@@ street &apos;s corps , but by the following day , August 30 , he took command of the division when H@@ atch was wounded , and he led his men to cover the retreat of the Union Army .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday again led the division , now assigned to the I Corps of the Army of the Pot@@ om@@ ac , after South Mountain , where H@@ atch was wounded again .
at Anti@@ et@@ am , he led his men into the deadly fighting in the Corn@@ field and the West Woods , and one colonel described him as a &quot; gallant officer ... remarkably cool and at the very front of battle . &quot; he was wounded when an artillery shell exploded near his horse , throwing him to the ground in a violent fall .
he received a bre@@ vet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his actions at Anti@@ et@@ am and was promoted in March 1863 to major general of volunteers , to rank from November 29 , 18@@ 62 .
at Freder@@ ick@@ sburg in December 18@@ 62 , his division mostly sat idle .
during the winter , the I Corps was reorganized and Dou@@ bl@@ eday assumed command of the 3rd Division .
at Chancell@@ or@@ s@@ ville in May 1863 , the division was kept in reserve .
</p>
<p>
at the start of the Battle of Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg , July 1 , 1863 , Dou@@ bl@@ eday &apos;s division was the second infantry division on the field to reinforce the cavalry division of Brigadier General John Bu@@ ford .
when his corps commander , Major General John F. Reynolds , was killed very early in the fighting , Dou@@ bl@@ eday found himself in command of the corps at 10 : 50 am .
his men fought well in the morning , putting up a stout resistance , but as overwhelming Confederate forces mas@@ sed against them , their line eventually broke and they retreated back through the town of Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg to the relative safety of Cemetery Hill south of town .
it was Dou@@ bl@@ eday &apos;s finest performance during the war , five hours leading 9,500 men against ten Confederate brigades that numbered more than 16,000 .
seven of those brigades sustained casualties that ranged from 35 to 50 percent , indicating the ferocity of the Union defense .
on Cemetery Hill , however , the I Corps could muster only a third of its men as effective for duty , and the corps was essentially destroyed as a combat force for the rest of the battle ; it would be decommissioned in March 1864 , its surviving units consolidated into other corps .
on July 2 , 1863 , Army of the Pot@@ om@@ ac commander Maj@@ . Gen. George G. Me@@ ade replaced Dou@@ bl@@ eday with Major General John Newton , a more junior officer from another corps .
the osten@@ sible reason was a false report by XI Corps commander Major General Oliver O. Howard that Dou@@ bl@@ eday &apos;s corps broke first , causing the entire Union line to collapse , but Me@@ ade also had a long history of disdain for Dou@@ bl@@ eday &apos;s combat effectiveness , dating back to South Mountain .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday was humiliated by this snu@@ b and held a lasting grudge against Me@@ ade , but he returned to division command and fought well for the remainder of the battle .
he was wounded in the neck on the second day of Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg and received a bre@@ vet promotion to colonel in the regular army for his service .
he formally requested reinstatement as I Corps commander , but Me@@ ade refused , and Dou@@ bl@@ eday left Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg on July 7 for Washington .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday &apos;s indecision as a commander in the war resulted in his un@@ complimentary nickname &quot; Forty @-@ Eight Hours . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Dou@@ bl@@ eday assumed administrative duties in the defenses of Washington , D.C. , where he was in charge of courts martial , which gave him legal experience that he used after the war .
his only return to combat was directing a portion of the defenses against the attack by Confederate Lieutenant General Ju@@ bal A. Early in the Valley Campa@@ igns of 1864 .
also while in Washington , Dou@@ bl@@ eday testified against George Me@@ ade at the United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War , criticizing him harshly over his conduct of the Battle of Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg .
while in Washington , Dou@@ bl@@ eday remained a loyal Republican and staunch supporter of President Abraham Lincoln .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday rode with Lincoln on the train to Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg for the Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg Address and Col. and Mrs. Dou@@ bl@@ eday attended events with Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln in Washington .
</p>
<p>
after the Civil War , Dou@@ bl@@ eday must@@ ered out of the volunteer service on August 24 , 18@@ 65 , reverted to the rank of lieutenant colonel , and became the colonel of the 35th U.S. Infantry in September 1867 .
he was stationed in San Francisco from 18@@ 69 through 18@@ 71 and he took out a patent for the cable car railway that still runs there , receiving a charter for its operation , but signing away his rights when he was reassigned .
in 18@@ 71 he commanded the 24th U.S. Infantry , an all African @-@ American regiment with headquarters at Fort Mc@@ Kav@@ ett , Texas .
he retired in 18@@ 73 In the 18@@ 70s , he was listed in the New York business directory as lawyer .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday spent much of his time writing .
he published two important works on the Civil War :
&quot; remin@@ isc@@ ences of For@@ ts Sum@@ ter and M@@ oul@@ tri@@ e &quot; , and &quot; Chancell@@ or@@ s@@ ville and Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg &quot; , the latter being a volume of the series &quot; Campa@@ igns of the Civil War &quot; .
</p>
<p>
in the summer of 18@@ 78 , Dou@@ bl@@ eday lived in Mend@@ ham Township , New Jersey , and became a prominent member of the The@@ os@@ oph@@ ical Society .
when two of the founders of that society , Helena Bla@@ v@@ at@@ sky and Henry Steel Ol@@ cott , moved to India at the end of that year , he was constituted as the president of the American body .
another prominent member was Thomas A. Edison .
</p>
<p>
Dou@@ bl@@ eday died of heart disease in 18@@ 93 .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday &apos;s body was laid in state in New York &apos;s City Hall and then was taken to Washington by train from Mend@@ ham Township , and is buried in Ar@@ lington National Cemetery in Ar@@ lington , Virginia .
</p>
<p>
although Dou@@ bl@@ eday achieved minor fame as a competent combat general with experience in many important Civil War battles , he is more widely known as the supposed inventor of the game of baseball , in Eli@@ hu Ph@@ in@@ ney &apos;s cow pasture in Cooper@@ stown , New York , in 18@@ 39 .
the Mills Commission , chaired by Abraham G. Mills , the fourth president of the National League , was appointed in 1905 to determine the origin of baseball .
baseball historian George B. Kirsch has described the results of the Mills Commission as a &quot; myth . &quot; he wrote , &quot; Robert Henderson , Harold Sey@@ m@@ our , and other scholars have since deb@@ un@@ ked the Dou@@ bl@@ eday @-@ Cooper@@ stown myth , which nonetheless remains powerful in the American imagination because of the efforts of Major League Bas@@ eball and the Hall of F@@ ame in Cooper@@ stown . &quot; at his death , Dou@@ bl@@ eday left many letters and papers , none of which describe baseball or give any suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the evolution of the game , and his &quot; New York Times &quot; ob@@ itu@@ ary did not mention the game at all .
Chairman Mills himself , who had been a Civil War colleague of Dou@@ bl@@ eday and a member of the honor guard for Dou@@ bl@@ eday &apos;s body as it lay in state in New York City , never recalled hearing Dou@@ bl@@ eday describe his role as the inventor .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday was a cad@@ et at West Point in the year of the alleged invention and his family had moved away from Cooper@@ stown the prior year .
furthermore , the primary testimony to the commission that connected baseball to Dou@@ bl@@ eday was that of Abner Gra@@ ves , whose credibility is questionable ; a few years later , he shot his wife to death and was committed to an institution for the criminally insane for the rest of his life .
part of the confusion could stem from there being another man by the same name in Cooper@@ stown in 18@@ 39 .
despite the lack of solid evidence linking Dou@@ bl@@ eday to the origins of baseball , Cooper@@ stown , New York , became the new home of what is today the National Bas@@ eball Hall of F@@ ame and Museum in 1937 .
there may have been some relationship to baseball as a national sport and Abner Dou@@ bl@@ eday .
while the modern rules of baseball were formulated in New York during the 18@@ 40s , it was the scattering of New Yor@@ kers exposed to these rules throughout the country , that spread not only baseball , but also the &quot; New York Rules , &quot; thereby harmonizing the rules , and being a catalyst for its growth .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday was a high @-@ ranking officer , whose duties included seeing to provisions for the US Army fighting throughout the south and border states .
for the morale of the men , he is said to have provi@@ sioned balls and bats for the men .

there is a monument to Dou@@ bl@@ eday at Get@@ t@@ ys@@ burg erected by his men , admirers , and the state of New York .
there is a ob@@ el@@ isk monument at Ar@@ lington National Cemetery where he is buried , located about behind the Lee Mansion .
there was a movement to petition the post@@ master general to issue a U.S. postage stamp for him in 2011 , commemorating the 15@@ 0th anniversary of Fort Sum@@ ter .
Dou@@ bl@@ eday Field is a minor league baseball stadium named for Abner Dou@@ bl@@ eday , located in Cooper@@ stown , New York , near the Bas@@ eball Hall of F@@ ame .

Mend@@ ham Bor@@ ough , New Jersey and Mend@@ ham Township , New Jersey held a municipal holiday known as &quot; Abner Dou@@ bl@@ eday Day &quot; for numerous years in the General &apos;s honor and commissioned a plaque near the sight of his home in the borough in 1998 , even though the borough was known as Mend@@ ham Township back then .
in 2004 the Abner Dou@@ bl@@ eday Society erected a monument to Dou@@ bl@@ eday in Iron Spring Park , Ball@@ ston S@@ pa , near his birthplace .

<p>
in the movie &quot; The Rid@@ ic@@ ulous 6 &quot; , Dou@@ bl@@ eday is portrayed by John Tur@@ tur@@ ro .
the character organizes the first game of baseball between the six main characters and a group of Chinese immigrants , creating the rules as he goes , primarily to allow him to win .
in the 23rd episode of the anim@@ e &quot; Samu@@ rai Cham@@ plo@@ o &quot; , titled &quot; Bas@@ eball Blu@@ es , &quot; Dou@@ bl@@ eday and Alexander Car@@ tw@@ right are featured as American naval officers who engage the main characters and local Japanese people into a baseball game , which the Americans lose .

Augustin @-@ Jean Fres@@ nel was a French civil engineer and physicist whose research in optics led to the almost unanimous acceptance of the wave theory of light , excluding any remnant of Newton &apos;s cor@@ pus@@ cular theory , from the late 18@@ 30s until the end of the 19th century .
but he is perhaps better known for inventing the cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric Fres@@ nel lens and for pioneering the use of &quot; stepped &quot; lenses to extend the visibility of ligh@@ thouses , saving countless lives at sea .
the simpler di@@ op@@ tric stepped lens , first proposed by Count Buff@@ on and independently rein@@ vented by Fres@@ nel , is used in screen magni@@ fiers and in condenser lenses for overhead projec@@ tors .
by expressing Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; principle of secondary waves and Young &apos;s principle of interference in quantitative terms , and supposing that simple colors consist of sin@@ us@@ oidal waves , Fres@@ nel gave the first satisfactory explanation of diffraction by straight edges , including the first satisfactory wave @-@ based explanation of recti@@ linear propagation .
part of his argument was a proof that the addition of sin@@ us@@ oidal functions of the same frequency but different phases is analogous to the addition of forces with different directions .
by further supposing that light waves are purely transverse , Fres@@ nel explained the nature of polarization and lack thereof , the mechanism of chromatic polarization , and the transmission and reflection coefficients at the interface between two transparent is@@ otropic media .
then , by gener@@ alizing the direction @-@ speed @-@ polarization relation for cal@@ cite , he accounted for the directions and polar@@ izations of the refrac@@ ted rays in doubly @-@ refractive crystals of the &quot; bi@@ axial &quot; class .
the period between the first publication of his pure @-@ transverse @-@ wave hypothesis and the submission of his first correct solution to the bi@@ axial problem was less than a year .
later , he coined the terms &quot; linear polarization &quot; , &quot; circular polarization &quot; , and &quot; elliptical polarization &quot; , explained how optical rotation could be understood as a difference in propagation speeds for the two directions of circular polarization , and accounted for the change in polarization due to total internal reflection , as exploited in the Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b .
defenders of the established cor@@ pus@@ cular theory could not match his quantitative explanations of so many phenomena on so few assumptions .
Fres@@ nel &apos;s legacy is the more remarkable in view of his lifelong battle with tuberculosis , to which he succumbed at the age of 39 .
although he did not become a public celebrity in his short lifetime , he lived just long enough to receive due recognition from his peers , including the Rum@@ ford Medal of the Royal Society of London , and his name is ubiquitous in the modern terminology of optics and waves .
inevitably , after the wave theory of light was subsumed by Maxwell &apos;s electromagnetic theory in the 18@@ 60s , some attention was diverted from the magnitude of Fres@@ nel &apos;s contribution .
in the period between Fres@@ nel &apos;s unification of physical optics and Maxwell &apos;s wider unification , a contemporary authority , Professor Humphrey Lloyd , described Fres@@ nel &apos;s transverse @-@ wave theory as &quot; the noblest fabric which has ever adorned the domain of physical science , Newton &apos;s system of the universe alone excepted . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Augustin @-@ Jean Fres@@ nel , born in Bro@@ g@@ lie , Normandy , on 10 May 17@@ 88 , was the second of four sons of the architect Jacques Fres@@ nel and his wife Augustine , &quot; n@@ ée &quot; Mé@@ ri@@ mé@@ e .
in 17@@ 90 , following the Revolution , Bro@@ g@@ lie became part of the dé@@ par@@ te@@ ment of E@@ ure .
the family moved at least twice - in 17@@ 90 to Ch@@ erb@@ ourg , and in 17@@ 94 to Jacques &apos; home town of Mathi@@ eu , where Madame Fres@@ nel would spend 25 years as a widow , out@@ living two of her sons .
the first son , Louis , was admitted to the É@@ cole Poly@@ technique , became a lieutenant in the artillery , and was killed in action at Jac@@ a , Spain , the day before his 23rd birthday .
the third , Lé@@ on@@ or , followed Augustin into civil engineering , succeeded him as Secretary of the Ligh@@ thouse Commission , and helped to edit his collected works .
the fourth , Ful@@ gence Fres@@ nel , became a noted lingu@@ ist , diplomat , and orient@@ alist , and occasionally assisted Augustin with negotiations .
Lé@@ on@@ or apparently was the only one of the four who married .
their mother &apos;s younger brother , Jean François &quot; Lé@@ on@@ or &quot; Mé@@ ri@@ mé@@ e , father of the writer Pro@@ s@@ per Mé@@ ri@@ mé@@ e , was a paint artist who turned his attention to the chemistry of painting .
he became the Permanent Secretary of the É@@ cole des Be@@ aux @-@ Arts and a professor at the É@@ cole Poly@@ technique , and was the initial point of contact between Augustin and the leading optical physicists of the day .
</p>
<p>
the Fres@@ nel brothers were initially home @-@ school@@ ed by their mother .
the sickly Augustin was considered the slow one , hardly beginning to read until the age of eight .
at nine and ten he was un@@ distinguished except for his ability to turn tree @-@ branches into toy bows and guns that worked far too well , earning himself the title &quot; l &apos;homme de g@@ é@@ nie &quot; from his accomplices , and a united crackdown from their elders .
in 18@@ 01 , Augustin was sent to the &quot; É@@ cole Centr@@ ale &quot; at Ca@@ en , as company for Louis .
but Augustin lifted his performance : in late 18@@ 04 he was accepted into the É@@ cole Poly@@ technique , being placed 17th in the entrance examination , in which his solutions to geometry problems impressed the examiner , Adri@@ en @-@ Marie Leg@@ end@@ re .
as the surviving records of the É@@ cole Poly@@ technique begin in 18@@ 08 , we know little of Augustin &apos;s time there , except that he apparently exc@@ elled in geometry and drawing - in spite of continuing poor health - and made few if any friends .
directly or indirectly , he was to remain in the employment of the &quot; Corps des Pon@@ ts &quot; for the rest of his life .
</p>
<p>
Augustin Fres@@ nel &apos;s parents were Roman Catholics of the J@@ ans@@ en@@ ist sect , characterized by an extreme Augus@@ tin@@ ian view of original sin .
religion took first place in the boys &apos; home @-@ schooling .
in 18@@ 02 , Mme Fres@@ nel wrote to Louis concerning Augustin :
I pray God to give my son the grace to employ the great talents , which he has received , for his own benefit , and for the God of all .
much will be asked from him to whom much has been given , and most will be required of him who has received most .
Augustin remained a J@@ ans@@ en@@ ist .
he indeed regarded his intellectual talents as gifts from God , and considered it his duty to use them for the benefit of others .
plagued by poor health , and determined to do his duty before death thwarted him , he shunned pleasures and worked to the point of exhaustion .
according to his fellow engineer Al@@ phon@@ se Dul@@ eau , who helped to nurse him through his final illness , Fres@@ nel saw the study of nature as part of the study of the power and goodness of God .
he placed virtue above science and genius .
yet in his last days he needed &quot; strength of soul , &quot; not against death alone , but against &quot; the interruption of discoveries ... of which he hoped to derive useful applications . &quot; J@@ ans@@ en@@ ism is considered here@@ tical by the Roman Catholic Church , and may be part of the explanation why Fres@@ nel , in spite of his scientific achievements and his roy@@ alist credentials , never gained a permanent academic teaching post ; his only teaching appointment was at the Ath@@ én@@ ée in the winter of 18@@ 19 @-@ 20 .
be that as it may , the brief article on Fres@@ nel in the old &quot; Catholic En@@ cycl@@ opedia &quot; does not mention his J@@ ans@@ en@@ ism , but describes him as &quot; a deeply religious man and remarkable for his keen sense of duty . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Fres@@ nel was initially posted to the western dé@@ par@@ te@@ ment of V@@ end@@ ée .
there , in 18@@ 11 , he anticipated what became known as the Sol@@ v@@ ay process for producing soda ash , except that recycling of the ammonia was not considered .
that difference may explain why leading chemists , who learned of his discovery through his uncle Lé@@ on@@ or , eventually thought it un@@ economic .
about 18@@ 12 , Fres@@ nel was sent to Ny@@ ons , in the southern dé@@ par@@ te@@ ment of Dr@@ ôme , to assist with the imperial highway that was to connect Spain and Italy .
it is from Ny@@ ons that we have the first evidence of his interest in optics .
on 15 May 1814 , while work was slack due to Napoleon &apos;s defeat , Fres@@ nel wrote a &quot; &quot; P.@@ S. &quot; &quot; to his brother Lé@@ on@@ or , saying in part :
I would also like to have papers that might tell me about the discoveries of French physicists on the polarization of light .
I saw in the &quot; Monit@@ eur &quot; of a few months ago that Bi@@ ot had read to the Institute a very interesting memoir on the &quot; polarization of light &quot; .
though I break my head , I cannot guess what that is .
at the end of 1814 he still had no information on the subject .
in March 1815 , perceiving Napoleon &apos;s return from El@@ ba as &quot; an attack on civilization , &quot; Fres@@ nel departed without leave , hastened to Toul@@ ouse and offered his services to the roy@@ alist resistance , but soon found himself on the sick list .
returning to Ny@@ ons in defeat , he was threatened and had his windows broken .
during the Hundred Days he was placed on suspension , which he was eventually allowed to spend at his mother &apos;s house in Mathi@@ eu .
there he used his enforced leisure to begin his optical experiments .
</p>
<p>
the appreciation of Fres@@ nel &apos;s reconstruction of physical optics might be assisted by an overview of the fragmented state in which he found the subject .
in this subsection , optical phenomena that were unexplained or whose explanations were disputed are named in bold type .
the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory of light , favored by Isaac Newton and accepted by nearly all of Fres@@ nel &apos;s seniors , easily explained recti@@ linear propagation : the cor@@ pus@@ cles obviously moved very fast , so that their paths were very nearly straight .
the wave theory , as developed by Christi@@ aan Hu@@ y@@ gens in his &quot; Tre@@ ati@@ se on Light &quot; , explained recti@@ linear propagation on the assumption that each point crossed by a traveling wav@@ efront becomes the source of a secondary wav@@ efront .
given the initial position of a traveling wav@@ efront , any later position was the common tangent surface of the secondary wav@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts emitted from the earlier position .
as the extent of the common tangent was limited by the extent of the initial wav@@ efront , the repeated application of Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; construction to a plane wav@@ efront of limited extent gave a straight , parallel beam .
while this construction indeed predicted recti@@ linear propagation , it was difficult to reconcile with the common observation that wav@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts on the surface of water can bend around obstructions , and with the similar behavior of sound waves - causing Newton to maintain , to the end of his life , that if light consisted of waves it would &quot; bend and spread every way &quot; into the shadows .
Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; theory neatly explained the law of ordinary reflection and the law of ordinary refraction , provided that the secondary waves traveled slower in dens@@ er media .
the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory , with the hypothesis that the cor@@ pus@@ cles were subject to forces acting perpendicular to surfaces , explained the same laws equally well , albeit with the implication that light traveled &quot; faster &quot; in dens@@ er media ; that implication was wrong , but could not be directly dis@@ proven with the technology of Newton &apos;s time or even Fres@@ nel &apos;s time .
similarly inconclusive was stellar aberration - that is , the apparent change in the position of a star due to the velocity of the earth across the line of sight .
identified by James Bradley in 17@@ 28 , stellar aberration was widely taken as confirmation of the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory .
but it was equally compatible with the wave theory , as E@@ ul@@ er noted in 17@@ 46 - tac@@ itly assuming that the a@@ ether near the earth was not disturbed by the motion of the earth .
the outstanding strength of Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; theory was his explanation of the bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ence of &quot; Iceland crystal &quot; , on the assumption that the secondary waves are spherical for the ordinary refraction and sph@@ ero@@ idal for the &quot; extraordinary &quot; refraction .
in general , Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; common @-@ tangent construction implies that rays are &quot; paths of least time &quot; between successive positions of the wav@@ efront , in accordance with Fer@@ mat &apos;s principle .
in the special case of is@@ otropic media , the secondary wav@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts must be spherical , and Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; construction then implies that the rays are perpendicular to the wav@@ efront ; indeed , the law of &quot; ordinary &quot; refraction can be separately derived from that premise , as Ign@@ ace @-@ Gast@@ on Par@@ dies did before Hu@@ y@@ gens .
although Newton rejected the wave theory , he noticed its potential to explain colors , including the colors of &quot; thin plates &quot; , on the assumption that light consists of &quot; periodic &quot; waves , with the lowest frequencies at the red end of the spectrum , and the highest frequencies at the violet end .
in 16@@ 72 he published a heavy hint to that effect , but contemporary supporters of the wave theory failed to act on it :
Robert Hoo@@ ke treated light as a periodic sequence of pulses but did not use frequency as the criterion of color , while Hu@@ y@@ gens treated the waves as individual pulses without any periodicity ; and Par@@ dies died young in 1673 .
Newton himself tried to explain colors of thin plates using the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory , by supposing that his cor@@ pus@@ cles had the wav@@ eli@@ ke property of alternating between &quot; fits of easy transmission &quot; and &quot; fits of easy reflection , &quot; the distance between like &quot; fits &quot; depending on the color and the medium and , awkwardly , on the angle of refraction or reflection into that medium .
more awkwardly still , this theory required thin plates to reflect only at the back surface , although &quot; thick &quot; plates manifestly reflected also at the front surface .
it was not until 18@@ 01 that Thomas Young , in the Bak@@ erian Lecture for that year , cited Newton &apos;s hint , and accounted for the colors of a thin plate as the combined effect of the front and back reflections , which reinforce or cancel each other according to the &quot; wavelength &quot; and the thickness .
young similarly explained the colors of &quot; stri@@ ated surfaces &quot; as the wavelength @-@ dependent reinforcement or cancellation of reflections from adjacent lines .
he described this reinforcement or cancellation as interference .
Newton , who called diffraction &quot; in@@ flexi@@ on , &quot; supposed that rays of light passing close to obstacles were bent ; but his explanation was only qualitative .
Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; common @-@ tangent construction , without modifications , could not accommodate diffraction at all .
two such modifications were proposed by Young in the same 18@@ 01 Bak@@ erian Lecture : first , that the secondary waves near the edge of an obstacle could diverge into the shadow , but only weakly , due to limited reinforcement from other secondary waves ; and second , that diffraction by an edge was caused by interference between two rays : one reflected off the edge , and the other inflec@@ ted while passing near the edge .
the latter ray would be und@@ evi@@ ated if sufficiently far from the edge , but Young did not elaborate on that case .
these were the earliest suggestions that the degree of diffraction depends on wavelength .
later , in the 1803 Bak@@ erian Lecture , Young ceased to regard inflec@@ tion as a separate phenomenon , and produced evidence that diffraction fringes &quot; inside &quot; the shadow of a narrow obstacle were due to interference : when the light from one side was blocked , the internal fringes disappeared .
but Young was alone in such efforts until Fres@@ nel entered the field .
Hu@@ y@@ gens , in his investigation of double refraction , noticed something that he could not explain : when light passes through two similarly oriented cal@@ cite crystals at normal incidence , the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the ordinary refraction in the second , while the extraordinary ray emerging from the first suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second ; but when the second crystal is rotated 90 ° about the incident rays , the roles are inter@@ changed , so that the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second , and vice versa .
this discovery gave Newton another reason to reject the wave theory : rays of light evidently had &quot; sides . &quot; cor@@ pus@@ cles could have sides ; but waves of light could not , because any such waves would need to be longitudinal .
but , as Young pointed out , the existence of such a velocity law was guaranteed by Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; sph@@ ero@@ id , because Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; construction leads to Fer@@ mat &apos;s principle , which becomes Mau@@ per@@ tu@@ is &apos;s principle if the ray speed is replaced by the reciprocal of the particle speed !
the cor@@ pus@@ cul@@ ari@@ sts had not found a &quot; force &quot; law that would yield the alleged velocity law .
worse , it was doubtful that any such force law would satisfy the conditions of Mau@@ per@@ tu@@ is &apos;s principle .
in contrast , Young proceeded to show that &quot; a medium more easily compres@@ sible in one direction than in any direction perpendicular to it , as if it consisted of an infinite number of parallel plates connected by a substance somewhat less elastic &quot; admits sph@@ ero@@ idal longitudinal wav@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts , as Hu@@ y@@ gens supposed .
but Mal@@ us , in the course of his experiments on double refraction , noticed something else : when a ray of light is reflected off a non @-@ metallic surface at the appropriate angle , it behaves like &quot; one &quot; of the two rays emerging from a cal@@ cite crystal .
it was Mal@@ us who coined the term polarization to describe this behavior , although the polar@@ izing angle became known as &quot; &apos; Brew@@ ster &apos;s angle &quot; &apos; after its dependence on the refractive index was determined experimentally by David Brew@@ ster in 1815 .
Mal@@ us also introduced the term &quot; plane of polarization &quot; .
in the case of polarization by reflection , his &quot; plane of polarization &quot; was the plane of the incident and reflected rays ; in modern terms , this is the plane &quot; normal &quot; to the &quot; electric &quot; vibration .
in 18@@ 09 , Mal@@ us further discovered that the intensity of light passing through &quot; two &quot; polar@@ izers is proportional to the squared co@@ sine of the angle between their planes of polarization , whether the polar@@ izers work by reflection or double refraction , and that &quot; all &quot; bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ent crystals produce both extraordinary refraction and polarization .
as the cor@@ pus@@ cul@@ ari@@ sts started trying to explain these things in terms of polar &quot; molecules &quot; of light , the wave @-@ theorists had &quot; no working hypothesis &quot; on the nature of polarization , prompting Young to remark that Mal@@ us &apos;s observations &quot; present greater difficulties to the advocates of the und@@ ulatory theory than any other facts with which we are acquainted . &quot; Mal@@ us died in February 18@@ 12 , at the age of 36 , shortly after receiving the Rum@@ ford Medal for his work on polarization .
in August 18@@ 11 , François Ara@@ go reported that if a thin plate of mica was viewed against a white polarized back@@ light through a cal@@ cite crystal , the two images of the mica were of complementary colors .
the light emerging from the mica was &quot; &quot; de &quot; polarized &quot; in the sense that there was no orientation of the cal@@ cite that made one image disappear ; yet it was not ordinary light , for which the two images would be of the same color .
rotating the cal@@ cite around the line of sight changed the colors , though they remained complementary .
rotating the mica changed the &quot; saturation &quot; of the colors .
this phenomenon became known as chromatic polarization .
replacing the mica with a much thicker plate of quartz , with its faces perpendicular to the optic axis , produced a similar effect , except that rotating the quartz made no difference .
Ara@@ go tried to explain his observations in &quot; cor@@ pus@@ cular &quot; terms .
in 18@@ 12 , as Ara@@ go pursued further qualitative experiments and other commitments , Jean @-@ Bap@@ ti@@ ste Bi@@ ot re@@ worked the same ground using a gypsum lam@@ ina in place of the mica , and found empirical formulae for the intensi@@ ties of the ordinary and extraordinary images .
the formulae contained two coefficients , supposedly representing colors of rays &quot; affected &quot; and &quot; unaffected &quot; by the plate - the &quot; affected &quot; rays being of the same color mix as those reflected by amorphous thin plates of proportional , but lesser , thickness .
Ara@@ go protested , declaring that he had made some of the same discoveries but had not had time to write them up .
in fact the overlap between Ara@@ go &apos;s work and Bi@@ ot &apos;s was minimal , because Ara@@ go &apos;s was only qualitative and sought to include other topics .
but the dispute triggered a notorious falling @-@ out between the two men .
later that year , Bi@@ ot tried to explain the observations as an oscillation of the alignment of the &quot; affected &quot; cor@@ pus@@ cles at a frequency proportional to that of Newton &apos;s &quot; fits , &quot; due to forces depending on the alignment .
this theory became known as &quot; mobile polarization &quot; .
to reconcile his results with a sin@@ us@@ oidal oscillation , Bi@@ ot had to suppose that the cor@@ pus@@ cles emerged with one of two permitted orientations , namely the extremes of the oscillation , with probabilities depending on the phase of the oscillation .
cor@@ pus@@ cular optics was becoming expensive on assumptions .
but in 18@@ 13 , Bi@@ ot reported that the case of quartz was simpler : the observable phenomenon was a gradual rotation of the polarization direction with distance , and could be explained by a corresponding rotation of the cor@@ pus@@ cles .
early in 1814 , reviewing Bi@@ ot &apos;s work on chromatic polarization , Young noted that the periodicity of the color as a function of the plate thickness - including the factor by which the period exceeded that for a reflective thin plate , and even the effect of obl@@ iqu@@ ity of the plate - could be explained by the wave theory in terms of the different propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves through the plate .
but Young was then the only public defender of the wave theory .
in summary , in the spring of 1814 , as Fres@@ nel tried in vain to guess what polarization was , the cor@@ pus@@ cul@@ ari@@ sts thought that they knew , while the wave @-@ theorists literally had no idea .
both theories claimed to explain recti@@ linear propagation , but the wave explanation was overwhelmingly regarded as unconvincing .
the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory could not link double refraction to specific surface forces ; the wave theory could not yet link it to polarization .
the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory was weak on thin plates and silent on gr@@ atings ; the wave theory was strong on both , but under @-@ appreciated .
concerning diffraction , the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory did not yield quantitative predictions , while the wave theory had begun to do so by considering diffraction as a manifestation of interference , but had only considered two rays at a time .
only the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory gave even a vague insight into Brew@@ ster &apos;s angle , Mal@@ us &apos;s law , or optical rotation .
concerning chromatic polarization , the wave theory explained the periodicity far better than the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory , but had nothing to say about the role of polarization ; and its explanation of the periodicity was largely ignored .
and Ara@@ go had founded the study of chromatic polarization , only to lose the lead , controversi@@ ally , to Bi@@ ot .
such were the circumstances in which Ara@@ go first heard of Fres@@ nel &apos;s interest in optics .
</p>
<p>
Fres@@ nel &apos;s letters from later in 1814 reveal his interest in the wave theory , including his awareness that it explained the constancy of the speed of light and was at least compatible with stellar aberration .
eventually he compiled what he called his &quot; r@@ ê@@ ver@@ ies &quot; into an essay and submitted it via Lé@@ on@@ or Mé@@ ri@@ mé@@ e to André @-@ Marie Amp@@ ère , who did not respond directly .
but on 19 December , Mé@@ ri@@ mé@@ e dined with Amp@@ ère and Ara@@ go , with whom he was acquainted through the É@@ cole Poly@@ technique ; and Ara@@ go promised to look at Fres@@ nel &apos;s essay .
in mid 1815 , on his way home to Mathi@@ eu to serve his suspension , Fres@@ nel met Ara@@ go in Paris and spoke of the wave theory and stellar aberration .
he was informed that he was trying to break down open doors , and directed to classical works on optics .
</p>
<p>
on 12 July 1815 , as Fres@@ nel was about to leave Paris , Ara@@ go left him a note on a new topic :
I do not know of any book that contains all the experiments that physicists are doing on the &quot; diffraction &quot; of light .
m &apos;@@ sieur Fres@@ nel will only be able to get to know this part of the optics by reading the work by Gri@@ mal@@ di , the one by Newton , the English treatise by Jordan , and the memoirs of B@@ rou@@ g@@ ham and Young , which are part of the collection of the &quot; Philosoph@@ ical Transactions &quot; .
Fres@@ nel would not have ready access to these works outside Paris , and could not read English .
but , in Mathi@@ eu - with a point @-@ source of light made by focusing sunlight with a drop of honey , a crude microm@@ eter of his own construction , and supporting apparatus made by a local lock@@ smith - he began his own experiments .
his technique was novel : whereas earlier investigators had projected the fringes onto a screen , Fres@@ nel soon abandoned the screen and observed the fringes in space , through a lens with the microm@@ eter at its focus , allowing more accurate measurements while requiring less light .
later in July , after Napoleon &apos;s final defeat , Fres@@ nel was reinstated with the advantage of having backed the winning side .
he requested a two @-@ month leave of absence , which was readily granted because road@@ works were in abeyance .
not surprisingly , he had re@@ traced many of Young &apos;s steps .
in a memoir sent to the Institute on 15 October 1815 , Fres@@ nel mapped the external and internal fringes in the shadow of a wire .
he noticed , like Young before him , that the internal fringes disappeared when the light from one side was blocked , and concluded that &quot; the vibrations of two rays that cross each other under a very small angle can contradict each other ... &quot; But , whereas Young took the disappearance of the internal fringes as &quot; confirmation &quot; of the principle of interference , Fres@@ nel reported that it was the internal fringes that first drew his attention to the principle .
to explain the diffraction pattern , Fres@@ nel constructed the internal fringes by considering the intersections of circular wav@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts emitted from the two edges of the obstruction , and the external fringes by considering the intersections between direct waves and waves reflected off the nearer edge .
for the external fringes , to obtain tolerable agreement with observation , he had to suppose that the reflected wave was inverted ; and he noted that the predicted paths of the fringes were hyper@@ bolic .
in the part of the memoir that most clearly surpassed Young , Fres@@ nel explained the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction in terms of interference , noting that if two parallel rays were reflected or refrac@@ ted at other than the prescribed angle , they would no longer have the same phase in a common perpendicular plane , and every vibration would be cancelled by a nearby vibration .
he noted that his explanation was valid provided that the surface irregularities were much smaller than the wavelength .
on 10 November , Fres@@ nel sent a supplementary note dealing with Newton &apos;s rings and with gr@@ atings , including , for the first time , &quot; transmission &quot; gr@@ atings - although in that case the interfering rays were still assumed to be &quot; inflec@@ ted , &quot; and the experimental verification was inadequate because it used only two threads .
as Fres@@ nel was not a member of the Institute , the fate of his memoir depended heavily on the report of a single member .
the reporter for Fres@@ nel &apos;s memoir turned out to be Ara@@ go .
on 8 November , Ara@@ go wrote to Fres@@ nel : I have been instructed by the Institute to examine your memoir on the diffraction of light ;
I have studied it carefully , and found many interesting experiments , some of which had already been done by Dr. Thomas Young , who in general regards this phenomenon in a manner rather analogous to the one you have adopted .
but what neither he nor anyone had seen before you is that the &quot; external &quot; colored bands do not travel in a straight line as one moves away from the opaque body .
the results you have achieved in this regard seem to me very important ; perhaps they can serve to prove the truth of the und@@ ulatory system , so often and so fee@@ bly combated by physicists who have not bothered to understand it .
Fres@@ nel was troubled , wanting to know more precisely where he had collided with Young .
concerning the curved paths of the &quot; colored bands , &quot; Young had noted the hyper@@ bolic paths of the fringes in the two @-@ source interference pattern , corresponding roughly to Fres@@ nel &apos;s &quot; internal &quot; fringes , and had described the hyper@@ bolic fringes that appear &quot; on the screen &quot; within rectangular shadows .
but Ara@@ go erred in his belief that the curved paths of the fringes were fundamentally incompatible with the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory .
Ara@@ go &apos;s letter went on to request more data on the external fringes .
Fres@@ nel complied , until he exhausted his leave and was assigned to R@@ ennes in the dé@@ par@@ te@@ ment of Il@@ le @-@ et @-@ Vil@@ aine .
at this point Ara@@ go inter@@ ceded with Gaspard de Pron@@ y , head of the É@@ cole des Pon@@ ts , who wrote to Louis @-@ Mathi@@ eu Mol@@ é , head of the Corps des Pon@@ ts , suggesting that the progress of science and the prestige of the Corps would be enhanced if Fres@@ nel could come to Paris for a time .
he arrived in March 18@@ 16 , and his leave was subsequently extended through the middle of the year .
meanwhile , in an experiment reported on 26 February 18@@ 16 , Ara@@ go verified Fres@@ nel &apos;s prediction that the internal fringes were shifted if the rays on one side of the obstacle passed through a thin glass lam@@ ina .
Fres@@ nel correctly attributed this phenomenon to the lower wave velocity in the glass .
Ara@@ go later used a similar argument to explain the colors in the scin@@ tillation of stars .
Fres@@ nel &apos;s updated memoir was eventually published in the March 18@@ 16 issue of &quot; Ann@@ ales de Chim@@ ie et de Physi@@ que &quot; , of which Ara@@ go had recently become co @-@ editor .
that issue did not actually appear until May .
in March , Fres@@ nel already had competition : Bi@@ ot read a memoir on diffraction by himself and his student Claude P@@ ou@@ illet , containing copious data and arguing that the regularity of diffraction fringes , like the regularity of Newton &apos;s rings , must be linked to Newton &apos;s &quot; fits . &quot; but the new link was not rigorous , and P@@ ou@@ illet himself would become a distinguished early adop@@ ter of the wave theory .
</p>
<p>
on 24 May 18@@ 16 , Fres@@ nel wrote to Young , acknowledging how little of his own memoir was new .
but in a &quot; supplement &quot; signed on 14 July and read the next day , Fres@@ nel noted that the internal fringes were more accurately predicted by supposing that the two interfering rays came from some distance &quot; outside &quot; the edges of the obstacle .
to explain this , he divided the incident wav@@ efront at the obstacle into what we now call &quot; Fres@@ nel zones &quot; , such that the secondary waves from each zone were spread over half a cycle when they arrived at the observation point .
the zones on each side of the obstacle largely canceled out in pairs , except the first , which was represented by an &quot; efficacious ray . &quot; this approach worked for the internal fringes , but the super@@ position of the efficacious ray and the direct ray did &quot; not &quot; work for the &quot; external &quot; fringes .
the contribution from the &quot; efficacious ray &quot; was thought to be only &quot; partly &quot; canceled , for reasons involving the dynamics of the medium : where the wav@@ efront was continuous , symmetry forbade oblique vibrations ; but near the obstacle that truncated the wav@@ efront , the asymmetry allowed some sideways vibration towards the geometric shadow .
this argument showed that Fres@@ nel had not fully accepted Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; principle , which would have permitted oblique radiation from all portions of the front .
in the same supplement , Fres@@ nel described his well @-@ known double mirror , comprising two flat mirrors joined at an angle of slightly less than 180 ° , with which he produced a two @-@ slit interference pattern from two virtual images of the same slit .
a conventional double @-@ slit experiment required a preliminary &quot; single &quot; slit to ensure that the light falling on the double slit was &quot; coherent &quot; .
in Fres@@ nel &apos;s version , the preliminary single slit was retained , and the double slit was replaced by the double mirror - which bore no physical resemblance to the double slit and yet performed the same function .
this result made it hard to believe that the two @-@ slit pattern had anything to do with cor@@ pus@@ cles being deflec@@ ted as they passed near the edges of the sl@@ its .
but 18@@ 16 was the &quot; Year Without a Summer &quot; : crops failed ; hungry farming families lined the streets of R@@ ennes ; the central government organized &quot; charity work@@ houses &quot; for the needy ; and in October , Fres@@ nel was sent back to Il@@ le @-@ et @-@ Vil@@ aine to supervise charity workers in addition to his regular road crew .
according to Ara@@ go , with Fres@@ nel conscienti@@ ousness was always the foremost part of his character , and he constantly performed his duties as an engineer with the most rigorous scrup@@ ul@@ ousness .
the mission to defend the revenues of the state , to obtain for them the best employment possible , appeared to his eyes in the light of a question of honour .
the functionary , whatever might be his rank , who submitted to him an ambiguous account , became at once the object of his profound contempt ....
under such circumstances the habitual gentleness of his manners disappeared ...
Fres@@ nel &apos;s letters from December 18@@ 16 reveal his consequent anxiety .
to Ara@@ go he complained of being &quot; tormented by the worries of surveillance , and the need to reprimand ... &quot; And to Mé@@ ri@@ mé@@ e he wrote :
&quot; I find nothing more tiresome than having to manage other men , and I admit that I have no idea what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
</p>
<p>
on 17 March 1817 , the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie des Sciences announced that diffraction would be the topic for the biannual physics &quot; Grand Prix &quot; to be awarded in 18@@ 19 .
the deadline for entries was set at 1 August 18@@ 18 to allow time for replication of experiments .
although the wording of the problem referred to rays and inflec@@ tion and did not invite wave @-@ based solutions , Ara@@ go and Amp@@ ère encouraged Fres@@ nel to enter .
in the fall of 1817 , Fres@@ nel , supported by de Pron@@ y , obtained a leave of absence from the new head of the Corp des Pon@@ ts , Louis Bec@@ qu@@ ey , and returned to Paris .
he resumed his engineering duties in the spring of 18@@ 18 ; but from then on he was based in Paris , first on the Canal de l &apos;@@ O@@ ur@@ c@@ q , and then with the cad@@ astre of the pavements .
on 15 January 18@@ 18 , in a different context , Fres@@ nel showed that the addition of sin@@ us@@ oidal functions of the same frequency but different phases is analogous to the addition of forces with different directions .
his method was similar to the phas@@ or representation , except that the &quot; forces &quot; were plane vectors rather than complex numbers ; they could be added , and multiplied by scal@@ ars , but not multiplied and divided by each other .
the explanation was algebraic rather than geometric .
knowledge of this method was assumed in a preliminary note on diffraction , dated 19 April 18@@ 18 and deposited on 20 April , in which Fres@@ nel outlined the elementary theory of diffraction as found in modern textbooks .
he restated Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; principle in combination with the super@@ position principle , saying that the vibration at each point on a wav@@ efront is the sum of the vibrations that would be sent to it at that moment by all the elements of the wav@@ efront in any of its previous positions , all elements acting separately .
for a wav@@ efront partly obstructed in a previous position , the summation was to be carried out over the un@@ obstructed portion .
in directions other than the normal to the primary wav@@ efront , the secondary waves were weakened due to obl@@ iqu@@ ity , but weakened much more by destructive interference , so that the effect of obl@@ iqu@@ ity alone could be ignored .
for diffraction by a straight edge , the intensity as a function of distance from the geometric shadow could then be expressed with sufficient accuracy in terms of what are now called the normalized Fres@@ nel integr@@ als : : : C = \ ! \ int _ 0 ^ x \ ! \ cos \ big \ , d@@ z ; S = \ ! \ int _ 0 ^ x \ ! \ sin \ big \ , d@@ z \ , .
the same note included a table of the integr@@ als , for an upper limit ranging from 0 to 5.1 in steps of 0.1 , computed with a mean error of 0.00@@ 03 , plus a smaller table of maxim@@ a and minim@@ a of the resulting intensity .
in his final &quot; M@@ emo@@ ir on the diffraction of light , &quot; deposited on 29 July and bearing the Latin epig@@ raph &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ura simpl@@ ex et fec@@ un@@ da &quot; &quot; , Fres@@ nel slightly expanded the two tables without changing the existing figures , except for a correction to the first minimum of intensity .
for completeness , he repeated his solution to &quot; the problem of interference , &quot; whereby sin@@ us@@ oidal functions are added like vectors .
he acknowledged the direc@@ tionality of the secondary sources and the variation in their distances from the observation point , chiefly to explain why these things make negligible difference in the context , provided of course that the secondary sources do not radiate in the retrograde direction .
then , applying his theory of interference to the secondary waves , he expressed the intensity of light diff@@ rac@@ ted by a single straight edge in terms of integr@@ als which involved the dimensions of the problem , but which could be converted to the normalized forms above .
with reference to the integr@@ als , he explained the calculation of the maxim@@ a and minim@@ a of the intensity , and noted that the calculated intensity falls very rapidly as one moves into the geometric shadow .
the last result , as Olivier D@@ arri@@ gol says , &quot; amounts to a proof of the recti@@ linear propagation of light in the wave theory , indeed the first proof that a modern physicist would still accept . &quot; for the experimental testing of his calculations , Fres@@ nel used red light with a wavelength of 6@@ 38@@ nm , which he deduced from the diffraction pattern in the simple case in which light incident on a single slit was focused by a cylindrical lens .
for a variety of distances from the source to the obstacle and from the obstacle to the field point , he compared the calculated and observed positions of the fringes for diffraction by a half @-@ plane , a slit , and a narrow strip - concentrating on the minim@@ a , which were visually sharper than the maxim@@ a .
for the slit and the strip , he could not use the previously computed table of maxim@@ a and minim@@ a ; for each combination of dimensions , the intensity had to be expressed in terms of sums or differences of Fres@@ nel integr@@ als and calculated from the table of integr@@ als , and the extre@@ ma had to be calculated anew .
the agreement between calculation and measurement was better than 1.5 % in almost every case .
near the end of the memoir , Fres@@ nel summed up the difference between Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; use of secondary waves and his own : whereas Hu@@ y@@ gens says there is light only where the secondary waves exactly agree , Fres@@ nel says there is complete darkness only where the secondary waves exactly cancel out .
the judging committee comprised La@@ place , Bi@@ ot , and Pois@@ son , Gay @-@ Lus@@ sac , and Ara@@ go , who eventually wrote the committee &apos;s report .
although entries in the competition were supposed to be anonymous to the judges , Fres@@ nel &apos;s must have been recognizable by the content .
there was only one other entry , of which neither the manuscript nor any record of the author has survived .
that entry was mentioned only in the last paragraph of the judges &apos; report , noting that the author had shown ignorance of the relevant earlier works of Young and Fres@@ nel , used insufficiently precise methods of observation , overlooked known phenomena , and made obvious errors .
in the words of John Wor@@ r@@ all , &quot; The competition facing Fres@@ nel could hardly have been less stiff . &quot; we may infer that the committee had only two options : Award the prize to Fres@@ nel , or withhold it .
the committee deliberated into the new year .
then Pois@@ son , exploiting a case in which Fres@@ nel &apos;s theory gave easy integr@@ als , predicted that if a circular obstacle were illuminated by a point @-@ source , there should be a bright spot in the center of the shadow , illuminated as brightly as the exterior .
this seems to have been intended as a &quot; reduc@@ tio ad absur@@ dum &quot; .
Ara@@ go , un@@ deterred , assembled an experiment with an obstacle 2@@ mm in diameter - and there , in the center of the shadow , was Pois@@ son &apos;s spot .
the unanimous report of the committee , read at the meeting of the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie on 15 March 18@@ 19 , awarded the prize to &quot; the memoir marked no@@ .2 , and bearing as epig@@ raph : &quot; Nat@@ ura simpl@@ ex et fec@@ un@@ da &quot; . &quot; at the same meeting , after the judgment was delivered , the president of the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie opened a sealed note accompanying the memoir , revealing the author as Fres@@ nel .
the award was announced at the public meeting of the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie a week later , on 22 March .
Ara@@ go &apos;s verification of Pois@@ son &apos;s counter @-@ intuitive prediction passed into folklore as if it had decided the prize .
that view , however , is not supported by the judges &apos; report , which gave the matter only two sentences in the penultimate paragraph .
neither did Fres@@ nel &apos;s triumph immediately convert La@@ place , Bi@@ ot , and Pois@@ son to the wave theory , for at least four reasons .
first , although the professionalization of science in France had established common standards , it was one thing to acknowledge a piece of research as meeting those standards , and another thing to regard it as conclusive .
second , it was possible to interpret Fres@@ nel &apos;s integr@@ als as rules for combining &quot; rays &quot; .
Ara@@ go even encouraged that interpretation , presumably in order to minimize resistance to Fres@@ nel &apos;s ideas .
even Bi@@ ot began teaching the Hu@@ y@@ gens @-@ Fres@@ nel principle without committing himself to a wave basis .
third , Fres@@ nel &apos;s theory did not explain the mechanism of generation of secondary waves or why they had any significant angular spread ; this issue particularly bothered Pois@@ son .
fourth , the question that most exercised optical physicists at that time was not diffraction , but polarization - on which Fres@@ nel had been working , but was yet to make his critical breakthrough .
</p>
<p>
an &quot; emission &quot; theory of light was one that regarded the propagation of light as the transport of some kind of matter .
while the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory was obviously an emission theory , the converse did not follow : in principle , one could be an em@@ ission@@ ist without being a cor@@ pus@@ cul@@ arist .
this was convenient because , beyond the ordinary laws of reflection and refraction , em@@ ission@@ ists never managed to make testable quantitative predictions from a theory of forces acting on cor@@ pus@@ cles of light .
but they &quot; did &quot; make quantitative predictions from the premises that rays were coun@@ table objects , which were conserved in their interactions with matter , and which had particular orientations with respect to their directions of propagation .
according to this framework , polarization and the related phenomena of double refraction and partial reflection involved altering the orientations of the rays and / or selecting them according to orientation , and the state of polarization of a beam was a question of how many rays were in what orientations : in a fully polarized beam , the orientations were all the same .
this approach , which J@@ ed Bu@@ ch@@ wald has called &quot; selec@@ tionism &quot; , was pioneered by Mal@@ us and diligently pursued by Bi@@ ot .
Fres@@ nel , in contrast , decided to introduce polarization into interference experiments .
</p>
<p>
in the summer of 18@@ 16 , Fres@@ nel discovered that when a bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ent crystal produced two images of a single slit , he could &quot; not &quot; obtain the usual two @-@ slit interference pattern , even if he compensated for the different propagation times .
a more general experiment , suggested by Ara@@ go , found that if the two beams of a double @-@ slit device were separately polarized , the interference pattern appeared and disappeared as the polarization of one beam was rotated , giving full interference for parallel polar@@ izations , but no interference for perpendicular polar@@ izations .
these experiments , among others , were eventually reported in a brief memoir published in 18@@ 19 and later translated into English .
in a memoir drafted on 30 August 18@@ 16 and revised on 6 October , Fres@@ nel reported an experiment in which he placed two matching thin lamin@@ ae in a double @-@ slit apparatus - one over each slit , with their optic axes perpendicular - and obtained two interference patterns offset in opposite directions , with perpendicular polar@@ izations .
this , in combination with the previous findings , meant that each lam@@ ina split the incident light into perpend@@ ic@@ ularly polarized components with different velocities - just like a normal bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ent crystal , and contrary to Bi@@ ot &apos;s &quot; mobile polarization &quot; hypothesis .
accordingly , in the same memoir , Fres@@ nel offered his first attempt at a wave theory of chromatic polarization .
when polarized light passed through a crystal lam@@ ina , it was split into ordinary and extraordinary waves , and these were perpend@@ ic@@ ularly polarized and therefore did not interfere , so that no colors were produced .
but if they then passed through an &quot; analyzer &quot; , their polar@@ izations were brought into alignment , and they would interfere .
this explanation , by itself , predicts that if the analyzer is rotated 90 ° , the ordinary and extraordinary waves simply switch roles , so that if the analyzer takes the form of a cal@@ cite crystal , the two images of the lam@@ ina should be of the same hue .
but in fact , as Ara@@ go and Bi@@ ot had found , they are of complementary colors .
to correct the prediction , Fres@@ nel proposed a phase @-@ inversion rule whereby &quot; one &quot; of the constituent waves of &quot; one &quot; of the two images suffered an additional 180 ° phase shift on its way through the lam@@ ina .
this inversion was a weakness in the theory relative to Bi@@ ot &apos;s , as Fres@@ nel acknowledged , although the rule specified which of the two images had the inverted wave .
moreover , Fres@@ nel could deal only with special cases , because he had not yet solved the problem of super@@ posing sin@@ us@@ oidal functions with arbitrary phase differences due to propagation at different velocities through the lam@@ ina .
he solved that problem in a &quot; supplement &quot; signed on 15 January 18@@ 18 .
in the same document , he accommodated Mal@@ us &apos;s law by proposing an underlying law : that if polarized light is incident on a bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ent crystal with its optic axis at an angle &quot; θ &quot; to the &quot; plane of polarization , &quot; the ordinary and extraordinary vibrations are scaled by the factors cos &quot; θ &quot; and sin &quot; θ &quot; , respectively .
although modern readers easily interpret these factors in terms of perpendicular components of a &quot; transverse &quot; oscillation , Fres@@ nel did not explain them that way .
hence he still needed the phase @-@ inversion rule .
he applied all these principles to a case of chromatic polarization not covered by Bi@@ ot &apos;s formulae , involving &quot; two &quot; successive lamin@@ ae with axes separated by 45 ° , and obtained predictions that disagreed with Bi@@ ot &apos;s experiments but agreed with his own .
Fres@@ nel applied the same principles to the standard case of chromatic polarization , in which &quot; one &quot; bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ent lam@@ ina was sliced parallel to its axis and placed between a polar@@ izer and an analyzer .
if the analyzer took the form of a thick cal@@ cite crystal with its axis in the plane of polarization , Fres@@ nel predicted that the intensi@@ ties of the ordinary and extraordinary images of the lam@@ ina were respectively proportional to : :
I _ o = \ cos ^ 2@@ i \ , \ cos ^ 2 + \ sin ^ 2@@ i \ , \ sin ^ 2 + \ t@@ frac \ sin 2@@ i \ , \ sin 2 \ cos \ phi \ , , : :
I _ e = \ cos ^ 2@@ i \ , \ sin ^ 2 + \ sin ^ 2@@ i \ , \ cos ^ 2 - \ t@@ frac \ sin 2@@ i \ , \ sin 2 \ cos \ phi \ , , where i is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the optic axis of the lam@@ ina , s is the angle from the initial plane of polarization to the plane of polarization of the final ordinary image , and \ phi is the phase lag of the extraordinary wave relative to the ordinary wave due to the difference in propagation times through the lam@@ ina .
the terms in \ phi are the frequency @-@ dependent terms and explain why the lam@@ ina must be &quot; thin &quot; in order to produce discernible colors : if the lam@@ ina is too thick , \ cos \ phi will pass through too many cycles as the frequency varies through the visible range , and the eye will not be able to resolve the cycles .
from these equations it is easily verified that \ , I _ o + I _ e = 1 \ , for all \ phi , so that the colors are complementary .
without the phase @-@ inversion rule , there would be a &quot; plus &quot; sign in front of the last term in the second equation , so that the \ phi @-@ dependent term would be the same in both equations , implying that the colors were of the same hue .
these equations were included in an undated note that Fres@@ nel gave to Bi@@ ot , to which Bi@@ ot added a few lines of his own .
if we substitute : : U = \ cos ^ 2 \ t@@ frac and A = \ sin ^ 2 \ t@@ frac \ , , then Fres@@ nel &apos;s formulae can be rewritten as : : \ ! I _ o = U \ cos ^ 2 s + A \ cos ^ 2 \ , , : :
I _ e = U \ sin ^ 2 s + A \ sin ^ 2 \ , , which are none other than Bi@@ ot &apos;s empirical formulae of 18@@ 12 , except that Bi@@ ot interpreted U and A as the &quot; unaffected &quot; and &quot; affected &quot; selections of the rays incident on the lam@@ ina .
if Bi@@ ot &apos;s substitu@@ tions were accurate , they would imply that his experimental results were more fully explained by Fres@@ nel &apos;s theory than by his own .
Ara@@ go delayed reporting on Fres@@ nel &apos;s works on chromatic polarization until June 18@@ 21 , when he used them in a broad attack on Bi@@ ot &apos;s theory .
in his written response , Bi@@ ot protested that Ara@@ go &apos;s attack went beyond the proper scope of a report on the nominated works of Fres@@ nel .
but Bi@@ ot also claimed that the substitu@@ tions for U and A , and therefore Fres@@ nel &apos;s expressions for I _ o and I _ e , were empirically wrong because when Fres@@ nel &apos;s intensi@@ ties of spectral colors were mixed according to Newton &apos;s rules , the squared co@@ sine and sine functions varied too smoothly to account for the observed sequence of colors .
that claim drew a written reply from Fres@@ nel , who disputed whether the colors changed as abruptly as Bi@@ ot claimed , and whether the human eye could judge color with sufficient objectivity for the purpose .
on the latter question , Fres@@ nel pointed out that different observers may give different names to the same color .
furthermore , he said , a single observer can only compare colors side @-@ by @-@ side ; and even if they are judged to be the same , the identity is of sensation , not necessarily of composition .
Fres@@ nel &apos;s oldest and strongest point - that thin crystals were subject to the same laws as thick ones and did not need or allow a separate theory - Bi@@ ot left unanswered .
Ara@@ go and Fres@@ nel were seen to have won the debate .
moreover , by this time Fres@@ nel had a new , simpler derivation of his equations on chromatic polarization .
</p>
<p>
in the draft memoir of 30 August 18@@ 16 , Fres@@ nel mentioned two hypotheses - one of which he attributed to Amp@@ ère - by which the non @-@ interference of ortho@@ gon@@ ally @-@ polarized beams could be explained if polarized light waves were &quot; partly &quot; transverse .
but Fres@@ nel could not develop either of these ideas into a comprehensive theory .
according to his later account , both he and Amp@@ ère realized as early as September 18@@ 16 that the non @-@ interference of ortho@@ gon@@ ally @-@ polarized beams , together with the phase @-@ inversion rule in chromatic polarization , would be most easily explained if the waves were &quot; purely &quot; transverse .
but that would raise a new difficulty : as natural light seemed to be &quot; un &quot; polarized and its waves were therefore presumed to be longitudinal , one would need to explain how the longitudinal component of vibration disappeared on polarization , and why it did not reappear when polarized light was reflected or refrac@@ ted obl@@ iqu@@ ely by a glass plate .
independently , on 12 January 1817 , Young wrote to Ara@@ go noting that a transverse vibration would constitute a polarization , and that if two longitudinal waves crossed at a significant angle , they could not cancel without leaving a residual transverse vibration .
young repeated this idea in an article published in a supplement to the &quot; En@@ cycl@@ op@@ æ@@ dia Brit@@ ann@@ ica &quot; in February 18@@ 18 , in which he added that Mal@@ us &apos;s law would be explained if polarization consisted in a transverse motion .
thus Fres@@ nel , by his own testimony , may not have been the first person to suspect that light waves could have a transverse &quot; component &quot; , or that &quot; polarized &quot; waves were exclusively transverse .
and it was Young , not Fres@@ nel , who first &quot; published &quot; the idea that polarization depends on the orientation of a transverse vibration .
but these incomplete theories had not reconciled the nature of polarization with the apparent existence of &quot; un@@ polarized &quot; light ; that achievement was to be Fres@@ nel &apos;s alone .
in a note that Bu@@ ch@@ wald dates in the summer of 18@@ 18 , Fres@@ nel entertained the idea that un@@ polarized waves could have vibrations of the same energy and obl@@ iqu@@ ity , with their orientations distributed uniformly about the wave @-@ normal , and that the degree of polarization was the degree of &quot; non &quot; -@@ uniformity in the distribution .
two pages later he noted , apparently for the first time in writing , that his phase @-@ inversion rule and the non @-@ interference of ortho@@ gon@@ ally @-@ polarized beams would be easily explained if the vibrations of fully polarized waves were &quot; perpendicular to the normal to the wave &quot; - that is , purely transverse .
but if he could account for &quot; lack &quot; of polarization by averaging out the transverse component , he did not also need to assume a longitudinal component .
it was enough to suppose that light waves are &quot; purely &quot; transverse , hence &quot; always &quot; polarized in the sense of having a particular transverse orientation , and that the &quot; un@@ polarized &quot; state of natural or &quot; direct &quot; light is due to rapid and random variations in that orientation , in which case two &quot; coherent &quot; portions of &quot; un@@ polarized &quot; light will still interfere because their orientations will be synchronized .
it is not known exactly when Fres@@ nel made this last step , because there is no relevant documentation from 1820 or early 18@@ 21 .
but he first &quot; published &quot; the idea in a paper on &quot; &quot; Cal@@ cu@@ l des te@@ int@@ es ... &quot; &quot; , seri@@ alized in Ara@@ go &apos;s &quot; Ann@@ ales &quot; for May , June , and July 18@@ 21 .
in the first installment , Fres@@ nel described &quot; direct &quot; light as &quot; the rapid succession of systems of waves polarized in all directions , &quot; and gave the modern explanation of chromatic polarization .
in the second installment , he revealed the suspicion that he and Amp@@ ère had har@@ bored since 18@@ 16 , and the difficulty it raised .
he continued : it has only been for a few months that , in med@@ itating more attentively on this subject , I have recognized that it is very probable that the oscill@@ atory movements of the light waves are executed solely according to the plane of these waves , &quot; for direct light as for polarized light &quot; .
according to this new view , he wrote , &quot; &quot; the act of polarization consists not in creating transverse motions , but in decom@@ posing them in two fixed , mutually perpendicular directions , and in separating the two components &quot; . &quot; while selec@@ tionists could insist on interpreting Fres@@ nel &apos;s diffraction integr@@ als in terms of discrete , coun@@ table rays , they could not do the same with his theory of polarization .
for a selec@@ tionist , the state of polarization of a beam concerned the distribution of orientations over the &quot; population &quot; of rays , and that distribution was presumed to be static .
for Fres@@ nel , the state of polarization of a beam concerned the variation of a displacement over &quot; time &quot; .
that displacement might be constrained but was &quot; not &quot; static , and rays were geometric constructions , &quot; not &quot; coun@@ table objects .
the conceptual gap between the wave theory and selec@@ tionism had become unbrid@@ geable .
the other difficulty posed by pure transverse waves , of course , was the apparent implication that the a@@ ether was an elastic solid but , unlike other elastic solids , incapable of transmitting &quot; longitudinal &quot; waves .
the wave theory was cheap on assumptions , but its latest assumption was expensive on cred@@ ul@@ ity .
if that assumption was to be widely entertained , its explanatory power would need to be impressive .
</p>
<p>
in the second installment of &quot; Cal@@ cu@@ l des te@@ int@@ es &quot; , Fres@@ nel supposed , by analogy with sound waves , that the density of the a@@ ether in a refractive medium was inversely proportional to the square of the wave velocity , and therefore directly proportional to the square of the refractive index .
for reflection and refraction at the surface between two is@@ otropic media of different indices , Fres@@ nel decomposed the transverse vibrations into two perpendicular components , now known as the &quot; s &quot; and &quot; p &quot; components , which are parallel to the &quot; surface &quot; and the &quot; plane &quot; of incidence , respectively ; in other words , the &quot; s &quot; and &quot; p &quot; components are respectively &quot; square &quot; and &quot; parallel &quot; to the plane of incidence .
for the &quot; s &quot; component , Fres@@ nel supposed that the interaction between the two media was analogous to an elastic collision , and obtained a formula for what we now call the &quot; reflec@@ tivity &quot; : the ratio of the reflected intensity to the incident intensity .
the predicted reflec@@ tivity was non @-@ zero at all angles .
the third installment was a short &quot; post@@ script &quot; in which Fres@@ nel announced that he had found , by a &quot; mechanical solution , &quot; a formula for the reflec@@ tivity of the &quot; p &quot; component , which predicted that &quot; the reflec@@ tivity was zero at the Brew@@ ster angle &quot; .
so polarization by reflection had been accounted for - but with the proviso that the direction of vibration in Fres@@ nel &apos;s model was &quot; perpendicular &quot; to the plane of polarization as defined by Mal@@ us .
for other angles of incidence , the technology of the time did not allow the &quot; s &quot; and &quot; p &quot; reflec@@ tivities to be measured accurately enough to test Fres@@ nel &apos;s formulae .
but the formulae could be rewritten in terms of what we now call the &quot; reflection coefficient &quot; : the signed ratio of the reflected amplitude to the incident amplitude .
then , if the plane of polarization of the incident ray was at 45 ° to the plane of incidence , the tangent of the corresponding angle for the reflected ray was obtainable from the &quot; ratio &quot; of the two reflection coefficients , and this angle could be measured .
Fres@@ nel measured it for a range of angles of incidence , for glass and water , and the agreement between the calculated and measured angles was better than 1.5 ° in all cases .
Fres@@ nel gave details of the &quot; mechanical solution &quot; in a memoir read to the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie des Sciences on 7 January 1823 .
conservation of energy was combined with continuity of the &quot; tan@@ gen@@ tial &quot; vibration at the interface .
the resulting formulae for the reflection coefficients and reflec@@ tivities became known as the &quot; Fres@@ nel equations &quot; .
the reflection coefficients for the &quot; s &quot; and &quot; p &quot; polar@@ izations are most succinctly expressed as : : R _ s = - \ frac and r _ p = \ frac \ , , where i and r are the angles of incidence and refraction ; these equations are known respectively as &quot; Fres@@ nel &apos;s sine law &quot; and &quot; Fres@@ nel &apos;s tangent law &quot; .
by allowing the coefficients to be &quot; complex &quot; , Fres@@ nel even accounted for the different phase shifts of the &quot; s &quot; and &quot; p &quot; components due to total internal reflection .
this success inspired James Mac@@ Cul@@ lag@@ h and Augustin @-@ Louis Cau@@ chy , beginning in 18@@ 36 , to analyze reflection from metals by using the Fres@@ nel equations with a complex refractive index .
the same technique is applicable to non @-@ metallic opaque media .
with these generalizations , the Fres@@ nel equations can predict the appearance of a wide variety of objects under illumination - for example , in computer graphics .
</p>
<p>
in a memoir dated 9 December 1822 , Fres@@ nel coined the terms &quot; linear polarization &quot; for the simple case in which the perpendicular components of vibration are in phase or 180 ° out of phase , &quot; circular polarization &quot; for the case in which they are of equal magnitude and a quarter @-@ cycle out of phase , and &quot; elliptical polarization &quot; for other cases in which the two components have a fixed amplitude ratio and a fixed phase difference .
he then explained how optical rotation could be understood as a species of bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ence .
linearly @-@ polarized light could be resolved into two circul@@ arly @-@ polarized components rotating in opposite directions .
these concepts called for a redefinition of the distinction between polarized and un@@ polarized light .
before Fres@@ nel , it was thought that polarization could vary in direction , and in degree , and that it could be a function of color , but not that it could vary in &quot; kind &quot; .
hence it was thought that the degree of polarization was the degree to which the light could be suppressed by an analyzer with the appropriate orientation .
light that had been converted from linear to elliptical or circular polarization was described as partly or fully &quot; de@@ polarized &quot; because of its behavior in an analyzer . &quot;
after &quot; Fres@@ nel , the defining feature of polarized light was that the perpendicular components of vibration had a fixed ratio of ampl@@ it@@ udes and a fixed difference in phase .
by that definition , ellip@@ tically or circul@@ arly polarized light is &quot; fully &quot; polarized although it cannot be fully suppressed by an analyzer alone .
the conceptual gap between the wave theory and selec@@ tionism had widened again .
</p>
<p>
by 1817 it had been discovered by Brew@@ ster , but not adequately reported , that plane @-@ polarized light was partly de@@ polarized by total internal reflection if initially polarized at an acute angle to the plane of incidence .
Fres@@ nel re@@ discovered this effect and investigated it by including total internal reflection in a chromatic @-@ polarization experiment .
with the aid of his &quot; first &quot; theory of chromatic polarization , he found that the apparently de@@ polarized light was a mixture of components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence , and that the total reflection introduced a phase difference between them .
choosing an appropriate angle of incidence gave a phase difference of 1 / 8 of a cycle .
two such reflections from the &quot; parallel faces &quot; of &quot; two coupled pris@@ ms &quot; gave a phase difference of 1 / 4 of a cycle .
these findings were contained in a memoir submitted to the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie on 10 November 1817 and read a fortnight later .
an undated marginal note indicates that the two coupled pris@@ ms were later replaced by a single &quot; parall@@ el@@ ep@@ ip@@ ed in glass &quot; - now known as a &quot; Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b &quot; .
this was the memoir whose &quot; supplement , &quot; dated January 18@@ 18 , contained the method of super@@ posing sin@@ us@@ oidal functions and the re@@ statement of Mal@@ us &apos;s law in terms of ampl@@ it@@ udes .
in the same supplement , Fres@@ nel reported his discovery that optical rotation could be im@@ itated by passing the polarized light through a Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b , followed by an ordinary bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ent lam@@ ina sliced parallel to its axis , with the axis at 45 ° to the plane of reflection of the Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b , followed by a second Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b at 90 ° to the first .
in a further memoir read on 30 March , Fres@@ nel reported that if polarized light was fully &quot; de@@ polarized &quot; by a Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b - now described as a parall@@ el@@ ep@@ ip@@ ed - its properties were not further modified by a subsequent passage through an op@@ tically rotating medium or device .
the connection between optical rotation and bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ence was further explained in 1822 , in the memoir on elliptical and circular polarization .
this was followed by the memoir on reflection , read in January 1823 , in which Fres@@ nel quantified the phase shifts in total internal reflection , and thence calculated the precise angle at which a Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b should be cut in order to convert linear polarization to circular polarization .
for a refractive index of 1.@@ 51 , there were two solutions : about 4@@ 8.6 ° and 5@@ 4.6 ° .

when light passes through a slice of cal@@ cite cut perpendicular to its optic axis , the difference between the propagation times of the ordinary and extraordinary waves has a second @-@ order dependence on the angle of incidence .
if the slice is observed in a highly convergent cone of light , that dependence becomes significant , so that a chromatic @-@ polarization experiment will show a pattern of concentric rings .
but most minerals , when observed in this manner , show a more complicated pattern of rings involving two fo@@ ci and a lem@@ n@@ isc@@ ate curve , as if they had &quot; two &quot; optic axes .
the two classes of minerals naturally become known as &quot; uni@@ ax@@ al &quot; and &quot; bi@@ ax@@ al &quot; - or , in later literature , &quot; uni@@ axial &quot; and &quot; bi@@ axial &quot; .
in 18@@ 13 , Brew@@ ster observed the simple concentric pattern in &quot; ber@@ yl , emerald , ruby &amp; c . &quot; the same pattern was later observed in cal@@ cite by Wol@@ la@@ ston , Bi@@ ot , and See@@ beck .
Bi@@ ot , assuming that the concentric pattern was the general case , tried to calculate the colors with his theory of chromatic polarization , and succeeded better for some minerals than for others .
in 18@@ 18 , Brew@@ ster bel@@ atedly explained why : seven of the twelve minerals employed by Bi@@ ot had the lem@@ n@@ isc@@ ate pattern , which Brew@@ ster had observed as early as 18@@ 12 ; and the minerals with the more complicated rings also had a more complicated law of refraction .
in a uniform crystal , according to Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; theory , the secondary wav@@ efront that expands from the origin in unit time is the &quot; ray @-@ velocity surface &quot; - that is , the surface whose &quot; distance &quot; from the origin in any direction is the ray velocity in that direction .
in cal@@ cite , this surface is two @-@ sh@@ ee@@ ted , consisting of a sphere and an obl@@ ate sph@@ ero@@ id touching each other at opposite points of a common axis - touching at the north and south poles , if we may use a geographic analogy .
but according to Mal@@ us &apos;s &quot; cor@@ pus@@ cular &quot; theory of double refraction , the ray velocity was proportional to the reciprocal of that given by Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; theory , in which case the velocity law was of the form : : V _ o ^ -@@ v _ e ^ 2 = k \ sin ^ 2 \ the@@ ta \ , , where v _ o and v _ e were the ordinary and extraordinary ray velocities &quot; according to the cor@@ pus@@ cular theory &quot; , and \ the@@ ta was the angle between the ray and the optic axis .
by Mal@@ us &apos;s definition , the plane of polarization of a ray was the plane of the ray and the optic axis if the ray was ordinary , or the perpendicular plane if the ray was extraordinary .
in Fres@@ nel &apos;s model , the direction of vibration was normal to the plane of polarization .
hence , for the sphere , the vibration was along the lines of latitude ; and for the sph@@ ero@@ id , the vibration was along the lines of longitude .
on 29 March 18@@ 19 , Bi@@ ot presented a memoir in which he proposed simple generalizations of Mal@@ us &apos;s rules for a crystal with &quot; two &quot; axes , and reported that both generalizations seemed to be confirmed by experiment .
for the velocity law , the squared sine was replaced by the &quot; product &quot; of the s@@ ines of the angles from the ray to the two axes .
and for the polarization of the ordinary ray , the plane of the ray and the axis was replaced by the plane bis@@ ec@@ ting the di@@ hedr@@ al angle between the two planes each of which contained the ray and one axis .
Bi@@ ot &apos;s laws meant that a bi@@ axial crystal with axes at a small angle , cle@@ aved in the plane of those axes , behaved nearly like a uni@@ axial crystal at near @-@ normal incidence ; this was fortunate because gypsum , which had been used in chromatic @-@ polarization experiments , is bi@@ axial .
</p>
<p>
until Fres@@ nel turned his attention to bi@@ axial bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ence , it was assumed that one of the two ref@@ r@@ actions was ordinary , even in bi@@ axial crystals .
but , in a memoir submitted on 19 November 18@@ 21 , Fres@@ nel reported two experiments on top@@ az showing that &quot; neither refraction &quot; was ordinary in the sense of satisfying Sn@@ ell &apos;s law ; that is , neither ray was the product of spherical secondary waves .
the same memoir contained Fres@@ nel &apos;s first attempt at the bi@@ axial velocity law .
for cal@@ cite , if we interchange the equatorial and polar radi@@ i of Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; obl@@ ate sph@@ ero@@ id while preserving the polar direction , we obtain a &quot; pro@@ late &quot; sph@@ ero@@ id touching the sphere at the equator .
a plane through the center / origin cuts this pro@@ late sph@@ ero@@ id in an ellipse whose major and minor semi @-@ axes give the magnit@@ udes of the extraordinary and ordinary ray velocities in the direction normal to the plane , and the directions of their respective vibrations .
the direction of the optic axis is the normal to the plane for which the ellipse of intersection reduces to a &quot; circle &quot; .
so , for the bi@@ axial case , Fres@@ nel simply replaced the pro@@ late sph@@ ero@@ id with a tri@@ axial ellip@@ so@@ id , which he called the &quot; ellip@@ so@@ id of elasticity , &quot; to be sec@@ tioned by a plane in the same way .
in general there would be &quot; two &quot; planes passing through the center of the ellip@@ so@@ id and cutting it in a circle , and the norm@@ als to these planes would give &quot; two &quot; optic axes .
from the geometry , Fres@@ nel deduced Bi@@ ot &apos;s sine law .
the &quot; ellip@@ so@@ id of elasticity &quot; indeed gave the correct ray velocities , although the initial experimental verification was only approximate .
but it did not give the correct directions of vibration , for the bi@@ axial case or even for the uni@@ axial case , because the vibrations in Fres@@ nel &apos;s model were tan@@ gen@@ tial to the wav@@ efront , which is &quot; not &quot; generally normal to the ray .
this mistake was corrected in an &quot; extract &quot; that Fres@@ nel read to the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie a week later , on 26 November .
starting with Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; sph@@ ero@@ id , Fres@@ nel obtained the 4th @-@ degree &quot; surface of elasticity &quot; which , when sec@@ tioned by a plane as above , would yield the &quot; wave @-@ normal velocities &quot; for a wav@@ efront in that plane , together with their vibration directions .
for the bi@@ axial case , he generalized the surface to allow three unequal principal dimensions .
but he retained the former &quot; ellip@@ so@@ id of elasticity &quot; as an approximation , from which he deduced Bi@@ ot &apos;s di@@ hedr@@ al law .
Fres@@ nel &apos;s initial derivation of the &quot; surface of elasticity &quot; had been purely geometric , and not deduc@@ tively rigorous .
his first attempt at a &quot; mechanical &quot; derivation , contained in a &quot; supplement &quot; dated 13 January 1822 , assumed that there were three mutually perpendicular directions in which a displacement produced a reaction in the same direction , the reaction was otherwise a linear function of the displacement , and the radius of the surface in any direction was the square root of the component , &quot; in that direction &quot; , of the reaction to a unit displacement in that direction .
the last assumption recognized the requirement that if a wave was to maintain a fixed direction of propagation and a fixed direction of vibration , the reaction must not be outside the plane of those two directions .
in the same supplement , Fres@@ nel considered how he might find , for the bi@@ axial case , the secondary wav@@ efront that expands from the origin in unit time - that is , the surface that reduces to Hu@@ y@@ gens &apos; sphere and sph@@ ero@@ id in the uni@@ axial case .
he noted that this &quot; wave surface &quot; is tan@@ gen@@ tial to all possible plane wav@@ ef@@ ron@@ ts that could have crossed the origin one unit of time ago , and he listed the mathematical conditions that it must satisfy .
but he doubted the feasibility of deriving the surface &quot; from &quot; those conditions .
in a &quot; second supplement , &quot; Fres@@ nel eventually exploited two related facts : the &quot; wave surface &quot; was also the ray @-@ velocity surface , which could be obtained by sec@@ tioning what he had mistakenly called the &quot; ellip@@ so@@ id of elasticity &quot; ; and the &quot; wave surface &quot; intersec@@ ted each plane of symmetry of the ellip@@ so@@ id in two curves : a circle and an ellipse .
later commentators put the equation in the more compact and memorable form : : \ frac + \ frac + \ frac \ , = \ , 1 \ , .
earlier in the &quot; second supplement , &quot; Fres@@ nel modeled the medium as an array of point @-@ masses and found that the force @-@ displacement relation was described by a symmetric matrix , confirming the existence of three mutually perpendicular axes on which the displacement produced a parallel force .
later in the document , he noted that in a bi@@ axial crystal , unlike a uni@@ axial crystal , the directions in which there is only one wave @-@ normal velocity are not the same as those in which there is only one ray velocity .
nowadays we refer to the former directions as the &quot; optic &quot; axes or &quot; bin@@ orm@@ al &quot; axes , and the latter as the &quot; ray &quot; axes or &quot; bi@@ radial &quot; axes .
Fres@@ nel &apos;s &quot; second supplement &quot; was signed on 31 March 1822 and submitted the next day - less than a year after the publication of his pure @-@ transverse @-@ wave hypothesis , and just less than a year after the demonstration of his prototype eight @-@ panel lighthouse lens .
</p>
<p>
Fres@@ nel still wanted a mechanical foundation for the ray @-@ velocity surface and Bi@@ ot &apos;s di@@ hedr@@ al law .
he attended to these matters in his &quot; second memoir &quot; on double refraction , published in the &quot; R@@ ecu@@ e@@ ils &quot; of the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie des Sciences for 18@@ 24 , which was not actually printed until late 18@@ 27 , a few months after his death .
having confirmed the three perpendicular axes on which a displacement produced a parallel reaction , and thence constructed the surface of elasticity , he showed that Bi@@ ot &apos;s di@@ hedr@@ al law is exact provided that the bin@@ orm@@ als are taken as the optic axes , and the wave @-@ normal direction as the direction of propagation .
as early as 1822 , Fres@@ nel discussed his perpendicular axes with Cau@@ chy .
acknowledging Fres@@ nel &apos;s influence , Cau@@ chy went on to develop the first rigorous theory of elasticity of non @-@ is@@ otropic solids , hence the first rigorous theory of transverse waves therein - which he promptly tried to apply to optics .
the ensuing difficulties drove a long competitive effort to find an accurate mechanical model of the a@@ ether .
Fres@@ nel &apos;s own model was not dynamically rigorous ; for example , it considered only the displacement of one particle while all others were fixed , and it simply &quot; assumed &quot; that the relation between the stiffness and the wave @-@ normal velocity was analogous to that for longitudinal sound waves .
but it was enough to enable the wave theory to do what selec@@ tionist theory could not : generate testable formulae covering a comprehensive range of optical phenomena , from &quot; mechanical &quot; assumptions .
</p>

in 1815 , Brew@@ ster reported that colors appear when a slice of is@@ otropic material , placed between crossed polar@@ izers , is mechanically stressed .
Brew@@ ster himself immediately and correctly attributed this phenomenon to stress @-@ induced bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ence - now known as &quot; photo@@ elasticity &quot; .
in a memoir read in September 1822 , Fres@@ nel announced that he had verified Brew@@ ster &apos;s diagnosis more directly , by com@@ pressing a combination of glass pris@@ ms so severely that one could actually see a double image through it .
in his experiment , Fres@@ nel lined up seven 45 ° -@@ 90 ° -@@ 45 ° pris@@ ms , short side to short side , with their 90 ° angles pointing in alternating directions .
two half @-@ pris@@ ms were added at the ends to make the whole assembly rectangular .
the pris@@ ms were separated by thin films of tur@@ pentine to suppress internal reflections , allowing a clear line of sight along the row .
when the four pris@@ ms with similar orientations were compressed in a vis@@ e , from apex to base across the line of sight , an object viewed through the assembly produced two images with perpendicular polar@@ izations , with an apparent spacing of 1.@@ 5@@ mm at one metre .
at the end of that memoir , Fres@@ nel predicted that one could use an analogous arrangement of pris@@ ms , without compression , to verify that optical rotation is a form of bi@@ ref@@ ring@@ ence .
if the pris@@ ms were cut from mon@@ ocr@@ yst@@ alline quartz with their optic axes aligned along the row , and with alternating directions of optical rotation , an object seen by looking along the common optic axis would give two images , which would seem un@@ polarized if viewed through an analyzer alone ; but if viewed through a Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b , they would be polarized at ± 45 ° to the plane of reflection .
in the memoir of December 1822 , in which he introduced the term &quot; circular polarization &quot; , he reported that he had confirmed this prediction .
to obtain a visible separation of the images , he needed only one 14 ° -@@ 152 ° -@@ 14 ° prism and two half @-@ pris@@ ms ; he merely remarked in passing that one could increase the separation by increasing the number of pris@@ ms .

for the supplement to Ri@@ ff@@ ault &apos;s translation of Thomson &apos;s &quot; System of Chemistry &quot; , Fres@@ nel was chosen to contribute the article on light .
the resulting 137 @-@ page essay , titled &quot; De la Lum@@ i@@ ère &quot; , was apparently finished in June 18@@ 21 and published by February 1822 .
with sections covering the nature of light , diffraction , thin @-@ film interference , reflection and refraction , double refraction and polarization , chromatic polarization , and modification of polarization by reflection , it made a comprehensive case for the wave theory to a readership that was not restricted to physicists .
to examine Fres@@ nel &apos;s first memoir and supplements on double refraction , the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie des Sciences appointed Amp@@ ère , Ara@@ go , Fourier , and Pois@@ son .
their report , of which Ara@@ go was clearly the main author , was delivered at the meeting of 19 August 1822 .
then , in the words of É@@ mile Ver@@ det , as translated by Iv@@ or Gr@@ attan @-@ Guinness :
immediately after the reading of the report , La@@ place took the floor , and ... proclaimed the exceptional importance of the work which had just been reported : he congratulated the author on his steadfastness and his sag@@ acity which had led him to discover a law which had escaped the clever@@ est , and , anticipating somewhat the judgement of posterity , declared that he placed these researches above everything that had been communicated to the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie for a long time .
whether La@@ place was announcing his conversion to the wave theory - at the age of 73 - is uncertain .
Gr@@ attan @-@ Guinness entertained the idea .
Bu@@ ch@@ wald , noting that Ara@@ go failed to explain that the &quot; ellip@@ so@@ id of elasticity &quot; did not give the correct planes of polarization , suggests that La@@ place may have merely regarded Fres@@ nel &apos;s theory as a successful generalization of Mal@@ us &apos;s ray @-@ velocity law , embracing Bi@@ ot &apos;s laws .
in the following year , Pois@@ son , who did not sign Ara@@ go &apos;s report , disputed the possibility of transverse waves in the a@@ ether .
starting from assumed equations of motion of a fluid medium , he noted that they did not give the correct results for partial reflection and double refraction - as if that were Fres@@ nel &apos;s problem rather than his own - and that the predicted waves , even if they were initially transverse , became more longitudinal as they propagated .
in reply Fres@@ nel noted , &quot; inter alia &quot; , that the equations in which Pois@@ son put so much faith did not even predict viscosity .
the implication was clear : given that the behavior of light had not been satisfactorily explained except by transverse waves , it was not the responsibility of the wave @-@ theorists to abandon transverse waves in deference to pre @-@ conceived notions about the a@@ ether ; rather , it was the responsibility of the a@@ ether model@@ ers to produce a model that accommodated transverse waves .
according to Eugene Frank@@ el , Pois@@ son eventually accepted the wave theory in the late 18@@ 30s .
among the French , Pois@@ son &apos;s reluctance was an exception .
according to Frank@@ el , &quot; in Paris no debate on the issue seems to have taken place after 18@@ 25 . indeed , almost the entire generation of physicists and mathematicians who came to maturity in the 18@@ 20s - P@@ ou@@ illet , Sav@@ art , Lam@@ é , N@@ avier , Li@@ ou@@ ville , Cau@@ chy - seem to have adopted the theory immediately . &quot; Fres@@ nel &apos;s other prominent French opponent , Bi@@ ot , appeared to take a neutral position in 1830 , and eventually accepted the wave theory - possibly by 18@@ 46 and certainly by 18@@ 58 .
in 18@@ 26 , the British astronomer John Her@@ sch@@ el , who was working on a book @-@ length article on light for the &quot; En@@ cycl@@ op@@ æ@@ dia Metro@@ polit@@ ana &quot; , addressed three questions to Fres@@ nel concerning double refraction , partial reflection , and their relation to polarization .
the resulting article , titled simply &quot; Light , &quot; was highly sympathetic to the wave theory , although not entirely free of selec@@ tionist language .
it was circulating privately by 18@@ 28 and was published in 1830 .
meanwhile , Young &apos;s translation of Fres@@ nel &apos;s &quot; De la Lum@@ i@@ ère &quot; was published in installments from 18@@ 27 to 18@@ 29 .
George Bid@@ dell A@@ iry , the former Lu@@ ca@@ sian Professor at Cambridge and future Astronom@@ er Royal , unreservedly accepted the wave theory by 18@@ 31 .
in 18@@ 34 he famously calculated the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture from the wave theory , thereby explaining the limited angular resolution of a perfect telescope .
by the end of the 18@@ 30s , the only prominent British physicist who held out against the wave theory was Brew@@ ster , whose objections included the difficulty of explaining photo@@ chemical effects and dispersion .
a German translation of &quot; De la Lum@@ i@@ ère &quot; was published in installments in 18@@ 25 and 18@@ 28 .
the wave theory was adopted by Fra@@ un@@ ho@@ fer in the early 18@@ 20s and by Franz Ernst Ne@@ um@@ ann in the 18@@ 30s , and then began to find favor in German textbooks .
the economy of assumptions under the wave theory was emphasized by William Whe@@ well in his &quot; History of the In@@ duc@@ tive Sciences &quot; , first published in 18@@ 37 .
in the cor@@ pus@@ cular system , &quot; every new class of facts requires a new supposition , &quot; whereas in the wave system , a hypothesis devised in order to explain one phenomenon is then found to explain or predict others .
in the cor@@ pus@@ cular system there is &quot; no unexpected success , no happy coincidence , no convergence of principles from remote quarters &quot; ; but in the wave system , &quot; all tends to unity and simplicity . &quot; hence , in 1850 , when Fou@@ ca@@ ult and Fiz@@ eau found by experiment that light travels more slowly in water than in air , in accordance with the wave explanation of refraction and contrary to the cor@@ pus@@ cular explanation , the result came as no surprise .

Fres@@ nel was not the first person to focus a lighthouse beam using a lens .
that distinction apparently belongs to the London glass @-@ cutter Thomas Rogers , who proposed the idea to Trinity House in 17@@ 88 .
the first Rogers lenses , 53@@ cm in diameter and 14@@ cm thick at the center , were installed at the Old Lower Ligh@@ thouse at Portland Bill in 17@@ 89 .
further samples followed at How@@ th B@@ aily , North For@@ eland , and at least four other locations .
but much of the light was wasted by absorption in the glass .
nor was Fres@@ nel the first to suggest replacing a convex lens with a series of concentric annular pris@@ ms , to reduce weight and absorption .
in 17@@ 48 , Count Buff@@ on proposed grinding such pris@@ ms as steps in a single piece of glass .
in 17@@ 90 , the Mar@@ quis de Con@@ dor@@ c@@ et suggested that it would be easier to make the annular sections separately and assemble them on a frame ; but even that was impractical at the time .
these designs were intended not for ligh@@ thouses , but for burning glasses .
Brew@@ ster , however , proposed a system similar to Con@@ dor@@ c@@ et &apos;s in 18@@ 11 , and by 1820 was advocating its use in British ligh@@ thouses .
</p>
<p>
meanwhile , on 21 June 18@@ 19 , Fres@@ nel was temporarily seconded by the &quot; Commission des P@@ ha@@ res &quot; on the recommendation of Ara@@ go , to review possible improvements in lighthouse illumination .
the Commission had been established by Napoleon in 18@@ 11 , and placed under the Corps des Pon@@ ts - Fres@@ nel &apos;s employer .
on 29 August 18@@ 19 , unaware of the Buff@@ on @-@ Con@@ dor@@ c@@ et @-@ Brew@@ ster proposal , Fres@@ nel presented his first report , in which he recommended what he called &quot; l@@ enti@@ l@@ les à éch@@ el@@ ons &quot; to replace the reflec@@ tors then in use , which reflected only about half of the incident light .
one of the assembled commissioners , Jacques Charles , recalled Buff@@ on &apos;s suggestion .
Fres@@ nel was disappointed to discover that he had again &quot; broken through an open door . &quot; but , whereas Buff@@ on &apos;s version was bic@@ on@@ v@@ ex and in one piece , Fres@@ nel &apos;s was plan@@ o @-@ convex and made of multiple pris@@ ms for easier construction .
with an official budget of 500 francs , Fres@@ nel approached three manufacturers .
the third , François Soleil , found a way to remove defects by re@@ heating and rem@@ olding the glass .
Ara@@ go assisted Fres@@ nel with the design of a modified Arg@@ and lamp with concentric w@@ icks , and accidentally discovered that fish glue was heat @-@ resistant , making it suitable for use in the lens .
the prototype , with a lens panel 55@@ cm square , containing 97 poly@@ gonal pris@@ ms , was finished in March 1820 - and so impressed the Commission that Fres@@ nel was asked for a full eight @-@ panel version .
completed a year later , largely at Fres@@ nel &apos;s personal expense , this model had panels 7@@ 2@@ cm square .
in a public spectacle on the evening of 13 April 18@@ 21 , it was demonstrated by comparison with the most recent reflec@@ tors , which it suddenly rendered obsolete .
</p>
<p>
Fres@@ nel &apos;s next lens was a rotating apparatus with eight &quot; bull &apos;s @-@ eye &quot; panels , made in annular ar@@ cs by Saint @-@ G@@ ob@@ ain , giving eight rotating beams - to be seen by mariners as a periodic flash .
above and behind each main panel was a smaller , sloping bull &apos;s @-@ eye panel of tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ idal outline with tra@@ pe@@ zo@@ idal elements .
this refrac@@ ted the light to a sloping plane mirror , which then reflected it horizontally , 7 degrees ahead of the main beam , increasing the duration of the flash .
below the main panels were 128 small mirrors arranged in four rings , stacked like the s@@ lats of a lou@@ ver or Venetian blind .
each ring , shaped like a fru@@ st@@ um of a cone , reflected the light to the horizon , giving a fain@@ ter steady light between the flashes .
the official test , conducted on the unfinished &quot; Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe &quot; on 20 August 1822 , was witnessed by the Commission - and by Louis and his entourage - from 32@@ km away .
the apparatus was stored at Bordeaux for the winter , and then reas@@ sem@@ bled at Cord@@ ou@@ an Ligh@@ thouse under Fres@@ nel &apos;s supervision .
on 25 July 1823 , the world &apos;s first lighthouse Fres@@ nel lens was lit .
it was about this time that Fres@@ nel started coughing up blood .
in May 18@@ 24 , Fres@@ nel was promoted to Secretary of the &quot; Commission des P@@ ha@@ res &quot; , becoming the first member of that body to draw a salary .
he was also an examiner at the É@@ cole Poly@@ technique since 18@@ 21 ; but poor health , long hours during the examination season , and anxiety about judging others induced him to resign that post in late 18@@ 24 , to save his energy for his lighthouse work .
in the same year he designed the first &quot; fixed &quot; lens - for spreading light evenly around the horizon while minimizing waste above or below .
this had the familiar reflecting rings above and below the refrac@@ ting parts .
but the curved refrac@@ ting surfaces were segments of tor@@ oids about a common vertical axis , so that the di@@ op@@ tric panel looked like a cylindrical drum and the entire apparatus looked like a bee@@ hive .
in 18@@ 25 he unveiled the &quot; Car@@ te des P@@ ha@@ res &quot; , calling for a system of 51 ligh@@ thouses plus smaller harbor lights , in a hierarchy of lens sizes , with different characteristics to facilitate recognition : a constant light , one flash per minute , and two per minute .
on 1 February 18@@ 25 , the second lighthouse Fres@@ nel lens entered service : a third @-@ order fixed lens at Dun@@ kir@@ k .
also in 18@@ 25 , Fres@@ nel extended his fixed design by adding a rotating array outside the fixed array .
each panel of the rotating array refrac@@ ted part of the fixed light from a horizontal fan into a narrow beam .
to reduce the loss of light in the reflecting elements , Fres@@ nel proposed to replace each mirror with a cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric prism , through which the light would travel by refraction through the first surface , then total internal reflection off the second surface , then refraction through the third surface .
the result was the lighthouse lens as we now know it .
in 18@@ 26 he assembled a small model for use on the Canal Saint @-@ Martin , but he did not live to see a full @-@ sized version .
the first large cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric lenses were made in 18@@ 42 for the ligh@@ thouses at Gra@@ v@@ elines and Î@@ le Vi@@ er@@ ge ; these were fixed third @-@ order lenses whose cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric rings were one metre in diameter .
the first @-@ order Sk@@ err@@ y@@ vor@@ e lens , installed in 1844 , was only partly cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric ; it was similar to the Cord@@ ou@@ an lens except that the lower s@@ lats were replaced by French @-@ made cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric pris@@ ms , while mirrors were retained at the top .
the first &quot; fully &quot; cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric first @-@ order lens , installed at A@@ illy in 18@@ 52 , also gave eight rotating beams plus a fixed light at the bottom ; but its top section had eight cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric panels focusing the light about 4 degrees ahead of the main beams , in order to lengthen the flashes .
the first fully cat@@ adi@@ op@@ tric lens with &quot; purely revolving &quot; beams - also of first order - was installed at Saint @-@ Cl@@ é@@ ment @-@ des @-@ Bal@@ e@@ ines in 18@@ 54 , and marked the completion of Fres@@ nel &apos;s original &quot; Car@@ te des P@@ ha@@ res &quot; .
</p>
<p>
production of one @-@ piece stepped lenses eventually became profitable .
by the 18@@ 70s , in the United States , such lenses were made of pressed glass and used with small lights on ships and piers .
similar lenses are used in &quot; Fres@@ nel lanterns &quot; for stage lighting .
lenses with finer steps serve as condens@@ ers in overhead projec@@ tors .
still finer steps can be found in low @-@ cost plastic &quot; sheet &quot; magni@@ fiers .

Fres@@ nel was elected to the &quot; Société Phil@@ om@@ a@@ thi@@ que de Paris &quot; in April 18@@ 19 , and in 1822 became one of the editors of the Société &apos;s &quot; Bulletin des Sciences &quot; .
as early as May 1817 , at Ara@@ go &apos;s suggestion , Fres@@ nel applied for membership of the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie des Sciences , but received only one vote .
the successful candidate on that occasion was Joseph Fourier .
in November 1822 , Fourier &apos;s elevation to Permanent Secretary of the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie created a vacancy in the physics section , which was filled in February 1823 by Pierre Louis Dul@@ ong , with 36 votes to Fres@@ nel &apos;s 20 .
but in May 1823 , after another vacancy was left by the death of Jacques Charles , Fres@@ nel &apos;s election was unanimous .
in 18@@ 24 , Fres@@ nel was made a &quot; ch@@ ev@@ alier de la Lé@@ gi@@ on d &apos;@@ hon@@ ne@@ ur &quot; .
meanwhile , in Britain , the wave theory was yet to take hold ;
Fres@@ nel wrote to Thomas Young in November 18@@ 24 , saying in part :
I am far from denying the value that I attach to the praise of English scholars , or pretending that they would not have flattered me agre@@ eably .
but for a long time this sensibility , or vanity , which is called the love of glory , has been much bl@@ unted in me :
I work far less to capture the public &apos;s votes than to obtain an inner appro@@ bation which has always been the sweetest reward of my efforts .
doubtless I have often needed the sting of vanity to excite me to pursue my researches in moments of disgust or discouragement ; but all the compliments I received from &quot; M@@ M. &quot; Ara@@ go , La@@ place , and Bi@@ ot never gave me as much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretical truth and the confirmation of my calculations by experiment .
but &quot; the praise of English scholars &quot; soon followed .
on 9 June 18@@ 25 , Fres@@ nel was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London .
in 18@@ 27 he was awarded the Society &apos;s Rum@@ ford Medal for the year 18@@ 24 , &quot; For his Development of the Un@@ dul@@ atory Theory as applied to the Phenomen@@ a of Pol@@ arized Light , and for his various important discoveries in Physical Op@@ tics . &quot; the monument to Fres@@ nel at his birthplace was dedicated on 14 September 18@@ 84 with a speech by , Permanent Secretary of the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie des Sciences . &quot; &quot; is among the 72 names embo@@ ssed on the Eiffel Tower .
in the 19th century , as every lighthouse in France acquired a Fres@@ nel lens , every one acquired a bust of Fres@@ nel , seemingly watching over the coastline that he had made safer .
the lunar features &quot; Prom@@ on@@ tor@@ ium Fres@@ nel &quot; and &quot; Rim@@ ae Fres@@ nel &quot; were later named after him .
</p>
<p>
Fres@@ nel &apos;s health , which had always been poor , deteriorated in the winter of 1822 @-@ 3 , increasing the urgency of his original research , and causing him to turn down an invitation from Young to write an article on double refraction for the &quot; En@@ cycl@@ op@@ æ@@ dia Brit@@ ann@@ ica &quot; .
the memoirs on circular and elliptical polarization and optical rotation , and on the detailed derivation of the Fres@@ nel equations and their application to total internal reflection , date from this period .
in the spring he recovered enough , in his own view , to supervise the lens installation at Cord@@ ou@@ an .
soon afterwards , it became clear that his condition was tuberculosis .
in 18@@ 24 he was advised that if he wanted to live longer , he needed to scale back his activities .
perceiving his lighthouse work to be his most important duty , he resigned as an examiner at the É@@ cole Poly@@ technique , and closed his scientific notebooks .
his last note to the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie , read on 13 June 18@@ 25 , described the first radi@@ ometer and attributed the observed repulsive force to a temperature difference .
although his fundamental research ceased , his advocacy did not ; as late as August or September 18@@ 26 , he found the time to answer Her@@ sch@@ el &apos;s queries on the wave theory .
it was Her@@ sch@@ el who recommended Fres@@ nel for the Royal Society &apos;s Rum@@ ford Medal .
Fres@@ nel &apos;s cough worsened in the winter of 18@@ 26 @-@ 7 , leaving him too ill to return to Mathi@@ eu in the spring .
in early June he was carried to V@@ ille @-@ d &apos;@@ Av@@ ray , 12@@ km west of Paris .
there his mother joined him .
on 6 July , Ara@@ go arrived to deliver the Rum@@ ford Medal .
sensing Ara@@ go &apos;s distress , Fres@@ nel whispered that &quot; the most beautiful crown means little , when it is laid on the grave of a friend . &quot; Fres@@ nel did not have the strength to reply to the Royal Society .
he died eight days later , on Bas@@ til@@ le Day .
he is buried at P@@ ère Lac@@ ha@@ ise Cemetery , Paris .
the is partly eroded away ; the legible part says , when translated , &quot; To the memory of Augustin Jean Fres@@ nel , member of the Institute of France . &quot;

Fres@@ nel &apos;s &quot; second memoir &quot; on double refraction was not printed until late 18@@ 27 , a few months after his death .
until then , the best published source on his work on double refraction was an extract of that memoir , printed in 1822 .
his final treatment of partial reflection and total internal reflection , read to the Ac@@ ad@@ é@@ mie in January 1823 , was thought to be lost until it was re@@ discovered among the papers of the deceased Joseph Fourier , and was printed in 18@@ 31 .
until then , it was known chiefly through an extract printed in 1823 and 18@@ 25 .
the memoir introducing the parall@@ el@@ ep@@ ip@@ ed form of the Fres@@ nel r@@ hom@@ b , read in March 18@@ 18 , was mis@@ laid until 18@@ 46 .
most of Fres@@ nel &apos;s writings on polarized light before 18@@ 21 - including his first theory of chromatic polarization and the crucial &quot; supplement &quot; of January 18@@ 18 - were not published in full until his &quot; O@@ eu@@ v@@ res compl@@ è@@ tes &quot; began to appear in 1866 .
the &quot; supplement &quot; of July 18@@ 16 , proposing the &quot; efficacious ray &quot; and reporting the famous double @-@ mirror experiment , met the same fate , as did the &quot; first memoir &quot; on double refraction .
publication of Fres@@ nel &apos;s collected works was itself delayed by the deaths of successive editors .
the task was initially entrusted to Félix Sav@@ ary , who died in 18@@ 41 .
it was restarted twenty years later by the Ministry of Public Instruction .
of the three editors eventually named in the &quot; O@@ eu@@ v@@ res &quot; , Sé@@ nar@@ mont died in 18@@ 62 , Ver@@ det in 1866 , and Lé@@ on@@ or Fres@@ nel in 18@@ 69 , by which time only two of the three volumes had appeared .
at the beginning of vol@@ .3 , the completion of the project is described in a long footnote by &quot; J. Lis@@ sa@@ j@@ ous . &quot; not included in the &quot; O@@ eu@@ v@@ res &quot; are two short notes by Fres@@ nel on magnetism , which were discovered among Amp@@ ère &apos;s manuscripts .
in response to Ø@@ r@@ sted &apos;s discovery of electromag@@ ne@@ tism in 1820 , Amp@@ ère initially supposed that the field of a permanent magnet was due to a macroscopic circulating current .
Fres@@ nel suggested instead that there was a &quot; microscopic &quot; current circulating around each particle of the magnet .
in his first note , he argued that microscopic currents , unlike macroscopic currents , would explain why a hollow cylindrical magnet does not lose its magnetism when cut longit@@ ud@@ inally .
in his second note , dated 5 July 18@@ 21 , he further argued that a macroscopic current had the counter@@ factual implication that a permanent magnet should be hot , whereas microscopic currents circulating around the molecules might avoid the heating mechanism .
he was not to know that the fundamental units of permanent magnetism are even smaller than molecules .
the two notes , together with Amp@@ ère &apos;s acknowledgment , were eventually published in 18@@ 85 .

<p>
Fres@@ nel &apos;s essay &quot; R@@ ê@@ ver@@ ies &quot; of 1814 has not survived .
while its content would have been interesting to historians , its quality may perhaps be gauged from the fact that Fres@@ nel himself never referred to it in his maturity .
more disturbing is the fate of the late article &quot; Sur les Diff@@ ér@@ ents Syst@@ è@@ mes relati@@ fs à la Th@@ é@@ orie de la Lum@@ i@@ ère &quot; , which Fres@@ nel wrote for the newly launched English journal &quot; European Review &quot; .
this work seems to have been similar in scope to the essay &quot; De la Lum@@ i@@ ère &quot; of 18@@ 21 / 22 , except that Fres@@ nel &apos;s views on double refraction , circular and elliptical polarization , optical rotation , and total internal reflection had developed since then .
the manuscript was received by the publisher &apos;s agent in Paris in early September 18@@ 24 , and promptly forwarded to London .
but the journal failed before Fres@@ nel &apos;s contribution could be published .
Fres@@ nel tried unsuccessfully to recover the manuscript .
the editors of his collected works were also unable to find it , and admitted that it was probably lost .
</p>
<p>
in 1810 , Ara@@ go found experimentally that the degree of refraction of starlight does not depend on the direction of the earth &apos;s motion relative to the line of sight .
in his analysis of double refraction , Fres@@ nel supposed that the different refractive indices in different directions within the &quot; same medium &quot; were due to a directional variation in elasticity , not density .
but in his treatment of partial reflection , he supposed that the different refractive indices of &quot; different media &quot; were due to different a@@ ether densities , not different elas@@ ti@@ cities .
the latter decision is puzzling in the context of double refraction , but makes sense in the earlier context of a@@ ether drag .
in 18@@ 46 , George Gabriel St@@ okes pointed out that there was no need to divide the a@@ ether inside a moving object into two portions ; all of it could be considered as moving at a common velocity .
then , if the a@@ ether was conserved while its density changed in proportion to n ^ 2 , the resulting velocity of the a@@ ether inside the object was equal to Fres@@ nel &apos;s additional velocity component .
conversely , Fres@@ nel could have started with the required additional velocity component , equated it to a@@ ether drag , combined that with conservation of a@@ ether , and arrived at the relation between refractive index and a@@ ether density , thereby justifying his choice in the case of partial reflection .
</p>
<p>
the analogy between light waves and transverse waves in elastic solids does not predict &quot; dispersion &quot; - that is , the frequency @-@ dependence of the speed of propagation , which enables pris@@ ms to produce spectra and causes lenses to suffer from chromatic aberration .
Fres@@ nel , in &quot; De la Lum@@ i@@ ère &quot; and in the second supplement to his first memoir on double refraction , suggested that dispersion could be accounted for if the particles of the medium exerted forces on each other over distances that were significant fractions of a wavelength .
later , more than once , Fres@@ nel referred to the demonstration of this result as being contained in a note appended to his second memoir on double refraction .
but no such note appeared in print , and the relevant manuscripts found after his death showed only that , around 18@@ 24 , he was comparing refractive indices with a theoretical formula , the meaning of which was not fully explained .
one obvious possibility is that the explanation of the formula was given in the appended note , which should be counted as another lost work .
in the 18@@ 30s , Fres@@ nel &apos;s suggestion was taken up by Cau@@ chy , Powell , and Kel@@ land , and it was indeed found to be toler@@ ably consistent with the variation of refractive indices with wavelength over the visible spectrum , for a variety of transparent media .
these investigations were enough to show that the wave theory was at least &quot; compatible &quot; with dispersion .
however , if the model of dispersion was to be accurate over a wider range of frequencies , it needed to be modified so as to take account of reson@@ ances within the medium .
</p>
<p>
the analytical complexity of Fres@@ nel &apos;s derivation of the ray @-@ velocity surface was an implicit challenge to find a shorter path to the result .
this was answered by Mac@@ Cul@@ lag@@ h in 1830 , and by William Row@@ an Hamilton in 18@@ 32 .
Hamilton went further , establishing two properties of the surface that Fres@@ nel , in the short time given to him , had overlooked : at each of the four points where the inner and outer sheets of the surface make contact , the surface has a tangent cone , hence a cone of norm@@ als , indicating that a cone of wave @-@ normal directions corresponds to a single ray @-@ velocity vector ; and around each of these points , the outer sheet has a circle of contact with a tangent plane , indicating that a cone of ray directions corresponds to a single wave @-@ normal velocity vector .
as Hamilton noted , these properties respectively imply that a narrow beam propagating inside the crystal in the direction of the single ray velocity will , on exiting the crystal through a flat surface , break into a hollow cone , and a narrow beam striking a flat surface of the crystal in the appropriate direction will , on entering the crystal , break into a hollow cone .
thus a new pair of phenomena , &quot; qualitatively &quot; different from anything previously observed or suspected , had been predicted by mathematics as consequences of Fres@@ nel &apos;s theory .
the prompt experimental confirmation of those predictions by Humphrey Lloyd brought Hamilton a prize that had never come to Fres@@ nel : immediate fame .

within a century of Fres@@ nel &apos;s initial stepped @-@ lens proposal , more than 10,000 lights with Fres@@ nel lenses were protecting lives and property around the world .
concerning the other benefits , the science historian Theresa H. Lev@@ itt has remarked : everywhere I looked , the story repeated itself .
the moment a Fres@@ nel lens appeared at a location was the moment that region became linked into the world economy .
in the history of physical optics , Fres@@ nel &apos;s successful revival of the wave theory nomin@@ ates him as the pivotal figure between Newton , who held that light consisted of cor@@ pus@@ cles , and James Clerk Maxwell , who established that light waves are electromagnetic .
whereas Albert Einstein described Maxwell &apos;s work as &quot; the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton , &quot; commentators of the era between Fres@@ nel and Maxwell made similarly strong statements about Fres@@ nel :
it would , perhaps , be too fanciful to attempt to establish a parallelism between the prominent persons who figure in these two histories .
if we were to do this , we must consider Hu@@ y@@ gh@@ ens and Hoo@@ ke as standing in the place of C@@ oper@@ nic@@ us , since , like him , they announced the true theory , but left it to a future age to give it development and mechanical confirmation ;
Mal@@ us and Brew@@ ster , grouping them together , correspond to Ty@@ cho Bra@@ he and Ke@@ pler , laborious in accumulating observations , inventive and happy in discovering laws of phenomena ; and Young and Fres@@ nel combined , make up the Newton of optical science .
what Whe@@ well called the &quot; true theory &quot; has since undergone two major revisions .
the first , by Maxwell , specified the physical fields whose variations constitute the waves of light .
the second , initiated by Einstein &apos;s explanation of the photoelectric effect , supposed that the energy of light waves was divided into qu@@ anta , which were eventually identified with particles called photons .
but photons did not exactly correspond to Newton &apos;s cor@@ pus@@ cles ; for example , Newton &apos;s explanation of ordinary refraction required the cor@@ pus@@ cles to travel faster in media of higher refractive index , which photons do not .
neither did photons displace waves ; rather , they led to the paradox of wave @-@ particle duality .
although Fres@@ nel did not know that light waves are electromagnetic , he managed to construct the world &apos;s first coherent theory of light .
in retrospect , this shows that his methods are applicable to multiple types of waves .
and although light is now known to have both wav@@ eli@@ ke and particle @-@ like aspects , the phenomena studied by Fres@@ nel are still most easily explained in terms of waves .
in these respects , his edifice still stands .

Alan Gar@@ ner is an English novelist best known for his children &apos;s fantasy novels and his ret@@ ell@@ ings of traditional British folk tales .
much of his work is firmly rooted in the landscape , history and folklore of his native county of Ches@@ hire , North West England , being set in the region and making use of the native Ches@@ hire dialect .
born in Con@@ g@@ leton , Gar@@ ner grew up around the nearby town of Alder@@ ley Edge , and spent much of his youth in the wooded area known locally as &apos; The Edge &apos; , where he gained an early interest in the folklore of the region .
studying at Manchester Gram@@ mar School and then briefly at Oxford University , in 1957 he moved to the nearby village of Black@@ den , where he bought and renovated an Early Modern building known as Toad Hall .
his first novel , &quot; The We@@ ir@@ d@@ stone of Bris@@ ing@@ amen &quot; , was published in 1960 .
a children &apos;s fantasy novel set on the Edge , it incorporated elements of local folklore in its plot and characters .
Gar@@ ner completed a sequel , &quot; The Moon of Gom@@ ra@@ th &quot; , but left the third book of the tril@@ ogy he had envisioned .
instead he wrote several fantasy novels , &quot; Eli@@ dor &quot; , &quot; The Ow@@ l Service &quot; and &quot; Red Shift &quot; .
turning away from fantasy as a genre , Gar@@ ner produced &quot; The Stone Book Quartet &quot; , a series of four short nov@@ ell@@ as detailing a day in the life of four generations of his family .
he also published a series of British folk tales which he had rewritten in a series of books entitled &quot; Alan Gar@@ ner &apos;s F@@ airy T@@ ales of Gold &quot; , &quot; Alan Gar@@ ner &apos;s Book of British F@@ airy T@@ ales &quot; and &quot; A Bag of Mo@@ on@@ shine &quot; .
in his subsequent novels , &quot; Str@@ and@@ lop@@ er &quot; and &quot; Thurs@@ bitch &quot; , he continued writing tales revolving around Ches@@ hire , although without the fantasy elements which had characterised his earlier work .
in 2012 , he finally published a third book in the We@@ ir@@ d@@ stone tril@@ ogy , &quot; Bon@@ eland &quot; .

&quot; I had to get aback &#91; to familial ways of doing things &#93; , by using skills that had been denied to my ancestors ; but I had nothing that they would have called worthwhile . my ability was in language and languages . I had to use that , somehow . and writing was a manual craft . but what did I know that I could write about ? I knew the land . &quot; Gar@@ ner was born in the front room of his grandmother &apos;s house in Con@@ g@@ leton , Ches@@ hire , on 17 October 1934 .
he was raised in nearby Alder@@ ley Edge , a well @-@ to @-@ do village that had effectively become a suburb of Manchester .
his &quot; rural working @-@ class family , &quot; had been connected to Alder@@ ley Edge since at least the sixteenth century , and could be traced back to the death of William Gar@@ ner in 15@@ 92 .
Gar@@ ner has stated that his family had passed on &quot; a genuine oral tradition &quot; involving folk tales about The Edge , which included a description of a king and his army of knights who slept under it , guarded by a wizard .
in the mid @-@ nineteenth century Alan &apos;s great @-@ great grandfather Robert had carved the face of a bearded wizard onto the face of a cliff next to a well , known locally at that time as the Wizard &apos;s Well .
Robert Gar@@ ner and his other relatives had all been craftsmen , and , according to Gar@@ ner , each successive generation had tried to &quot; improve on , or do something different from , the previous generation . &quot; Gar@@ ner &apos;s grandfather , Joseph Gar@@ ner , &quot; could read , but didn &apos;t and so was virtually un@@ let@@ tered . &quot; instead he taught his grandson the folk tales he knew about The Edge .
Gar@@ ner later remarked that as a result he was &quot; aware of &#91; the Edge &apos;s &#93; magic &quot; as a child , and he and his friends often played there .
the story of the king and the wizard living under the hill played an important part in his life , becoming , he explained , &quot; deeply embedded in my psyche &quot; and heavily influencing his later novels .
Gar@@ ner faced several life @-@ threatening childhood illnesses , which left him bed ridden for much of the time .
he attended a local village school , where he found that , despite being praised for his intelligence , he was punished for speaking in his native Ches@@ hire dialect ; for instance , when he was six his primary school teacher washed his mouth out with so@@ apy water .
Gar@@ ner then won a place at Manchester Gram@@ mar School , where he received his secondary education ; entry was means @-@ tested , resulting in his school fees being waived .
rather than focusing his interest on creative writing , it was here that he exc@@ elled at s@@ printing .
he used to go jogging along the highway , and later claimed that in doing so he was sometimes accompanied by the mathematician Alan Tur@@ ing , who shared his fascination with the Disney film &quot; Snow White and the Seven D@@ war@@ fs &quot; .
Gar@@ ner was then con@@ scripted into national service , serving for a time with the Royal Ar@@ tillery while posted to Wool@@ wich in Southeast London .
at school , Gar@@ ner had developed a keen interest in the work of Aes@@ ch@@ yl@@ us and Homer , as well as the Ancient Greek language .
thus , he decided to pursue the study of Class@@ ics at Magdal@@ en College , Oxford , passing his entrance exams in January 1953 ; at the time he had thoughts of becoming a professional academic .
he was the first member of his family to receive anything more than a basic education , and he noted that this removed him from his &quot; cultural background &quot; and led to something of a sch@@ ism with other members of his family , who &quot; could not cope with me , and I could not cope with &quot; them .
looking back , he remarked , &quot; I soon learned that it was not a good idea to come home excited over irregular verbs . &quot; in 1955 , he joined the university theatrical society , playing the role of Mark Anton@@ y in a performance of William Shakespeare &apos;s &quot; Anton@@ y and Cleopatra &quot; where he co @-@ star@@ red alongside Dudley Moore and where Kenneth Baker was the stage manager .
in August 1956 , he decided that he wished to devote himself to novel writing , and decided to abandon his university education without taking a degree ; he left Oxford in late 1956 .
he nevertheless felt that the academic rigour which he learned during his university studies has remained &quot; a permanent strength through all my life . &quot;

aged 22 , Gar@@ ner was out cycling when he came across a hand @-@ painted sign announcing that an agricultural cottage in Toad Hall - a Late Medi@@ eval building situated in Black@@ den , seven miles from Alder@@ ley Edge - was on sale for £ 510 .
although he personally could not afford it , he was lent the money by the local O@@ dd@@ fellow lodge , enabling him to purchase and move into the cottage in June 1957 .
in the late nineteenth century the Hall had been divided into two agricultural labourers &apos; cot@@ tages , but Gar@@ ner was able to purchase the second for £ 150 about a year later ; he proceeded to knock down the dividing walls and convert both halves back into a single home .
Gar@@ ner had begun writing his first novel , &quot; The We@@ ir@@ d@@ stone of Bris@@ ing@@ amen : a T@@ ale of Alder@@ ley &quot; , in September 1956 .
however it was while at Toad Hall that he finished the book .
set in Alder@@ ley Edge , it revolved around two children , Susan and Colin , who are sent to live in the area with their mother &apos;s old nurse maid , B@@ ess , and her husband , G@@ ow@@ ther Moss@@ ock .
Gar@@ ner sent his debut novel to the publishing company Collins , where it was picked up by the company &apos;s head , Sir William Collins , who was on the look out for new fantasy novels following on from the recent commercial and critical success of J. R. R. Tol@@ ki@@ en &apos;s &quot; The Lord of the R@@ ings &quot; .
Gar@@ ner , who went on to become a personal friend of Collins , would later relate that &quot; Billy Collins saw a title with funny @-@ looking words in it on the stockpile , and he decided to publish it . &quot; on its release in 1960 , &quot; The We@@ ir@@ d@@ stone of Bris@@ ing@@ amen &quot; proved to be a critical and commercial success , later being described as &quot; a tour de force of the imagination , a novel that showed almost every writer who came afterwards what it was possible to achieve in novels ostensibly published for children . &quot; Gar@@ ner himself however would later denounce this novel as &quot; a fairly bad book &quot; in 1968 .
with his first book published , Gar@@ ner abandoned his work as a labourer and gained a job as a freelance television reporter , living a &quot; hand to mouth &quot; lifestyle on a &quot; sho@@ e@@ string &quot; budget .
he also worked on a sequel to &quot; The We@@ ir@@ d@@ stone of Bris@@ ing@@ amen &quot; , which would be known as &quot; The Moon of Gom@@ ra@@ th &quot; . &quot;
the Moon of Gom@@ ra@@ th &quot; also revolves around the adventures of Colin and Susan , with the latter being possessed by a mal@@ evol@@ ent creature called the B@@ roll@@ ach@@ an who has recently entered the world .
with the help of the wizard Cad@@ ell@@ in , the B@@ roll@@ ach@@ an is exor@@ c@@ ised , but Susan &apos;s soul also leaves her body , being sent to another dimension , leading Colin to find a way to bring it back .
critic Neil Philip characterised it as &quot; an artistic advance &quot; but &quot; a less satisfying story . &quot; in a 1989 interview , Gar@@ ner stated that he had left scope for a third book following the adventures of Colin and Susan , envi@@ sioning a tril@@ ogy , but that he had intentionally decided not to write it , instead moving on to write something different .
however &quot; Bon@@ eland &quot; , the conclusion to the sequence , was bel@@ atedly published in August 2012 .
</p>
<p>
in 1962 Gar@@ ner began work on a radio play named &quot; Eli@@ dor &quot; , which would result in the completion of a novel of the same name .
set in contemporary Manchester , &quot; Eli@@ dor &quot; tells the story of four children who enter into a derelict Victorian church , in which they find a portal to the magical realm of Eli@@ dor .
here , they are entrusted by King Mal@@ ebr@@ on to help rescue four treasures which have been stolen by the forces of evil who are attempting to take control of the kingdom .
successfully doing so , the children return to Manchester with the treasures , but are pursued by the mal@@ evol@@ ent forces who need them to seal their victory .
inspired by this design , he produced his fourth novel , &quot; The Ow@@ l Service &quot; .
the story was also heavily influenced by the Medi@@ eval Welsh tale of Ma@@ th f@@ ab Math@@ on@@ w@@ y from , the &quot; Mab@@ ino@@ gi@@ on &quot; . &quot;
the Ow@@ l Service &quot; was critically acclaimed , winning both the Carnegie Medal and Guardian Children &apos;s Fic@@ tion Prize .
it also sparked discussions among critics as to whether Gar@@ ner should properly be considered a children &apos;s writer , given that this book in particular was deemed equally suitable for an adult readership .
it took Gar@@ ner six years to write his next novel , &quot; Red Shift &quot; .
in this , he provided three intertwined love stories , one set in the present , another during the English Civil War , and the third in the second century CE .
Philip referred to it as &quot; a complex book but not a complicated one : the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear . &quot; academic specialist in children &apos;s literature Maria Nikol@@ aj@@ eva characterised &quot; Red Shift &quot; as &quot; a difficult book &quot; for an unprepared reader , identifying its main themes as those of &quot; loneliness and failure to communicate . &quot; ultimately , she thought that repeated re @-@ readings of the novel bring about the realisation that &quot; it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so @-@ called &quot; realistic &quot; juvenile novels . &quot;
</p>
<p>
from 1976 to 1978 , Gar@@ ner published a series of four nov@@ ell@@ as , which have come to be collectively known as &quot; The Stone Book &quot; quartet :
&quot; the Stone Book &quot; , &quot; Gr@@ anny R@@ ear@@ dun &quot; , &quot; The A@@ imer Gate &quot; , and &quot; Tom F@@ ob@@ ble &apos;s Day &quot; .
each focused on a day in the life of a child in the Gar@@ ner family , each from a different generation .
in a 1989 interview , Gar@@ ner noted that although writing &quot; The Stone Book Quartet &quot; had been &quot; exhausting , &quot; it had been &quot; the most rewarding of everything &quot; he &apos;d done to date .
Philip described the quartet as &quot; a complete command of the material he had been working and re@@ working since the start of his career . &quot; Gar@@ ner pays particular attention to language , and strives to render the cad@@ ence of the Ches@@ hire tongue in modern English .
this he explains by the sense of anger he felt on reading &quot; Sir G@@ aw@@ ain and the Green Knight &quot; : the footnotes would not have been needed by his father .
in 1981 , the literary critic Neil Philip published an analysis of Gar@@ ner &apos;s novels as &quot; A Fine An@@ ger &quot; , which was based on his doctoral thesis , produced for the University of London in 1980 .
in this study he noted that &quot; &quot; The Stone Book &quot; quartet marks a watershed in Gar@@ ner &apos;s writing career , and provides a suitable moment for an evaluation of his work thus far . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in 1996 , Gar@@ ner &apos;s novel &quot; Str@@ and@@ lop@@ er &quot; was published .
his collection of essays and public talks , &quot; The Voice That Th@@ un@@ ders &quot; , contains much autobi@@ ographical material , as well as critical reflection upon folklore and language , literature and education , the nature of myth and time .
in &quot; The Voice That Th@@ un@@ ders &quot; he reveals the commercial pressure placed upon him during the decade @-@ long drought which preceded &quot; Str@@ and@@ lop@@ er &quot; to &apos; forsake &quot; literature , &quot; and become instead a &quot; popular &quot; writer , c@@ ashing in on my established name by producing sequ@@ els to , and making series of , the earlier books &apos; .
Gar@@ ner feared that &quot; making series ... would render sterile the existing work , the life that produced it , and bring about my artistic and spiritual death &quot; and felt unable to comply .
Gar@@ ner &apos;s novel &quot; Thurs@@ bitch &quot; was published in 2003 .
Gar@@ ner &apos;s novel , &quot; Bon@@ eland &quot; , was published in 2012 , nominally completing a tril@@ ogy begun some 50 years earlier with &quot; The We@@ ir@@ d@@ stone of Bris@@ ing@@ amen &quot; .
</p>
<p>
with his first wife Anne Cook he had three children .
in 1972 he married for a second time , this time to G@@ ris@@ el@@ da Gre@@ aves , a teacher and critic with whom he had two children .
in a 2014 interview conducted with Mike Pit@@ ts for &quot; British Archae@@ ology &quot; magazine , Gar@@ ner stated that &quot; I don &apos;t have anything to do with the literary world . I avoid writers . I don &apos;t like them . most of my close personal friends are professional archaeologists . &quot;
</p>
<p>
&quot; I have four filing cabinets of correspondence from readers , and over the years the message is clear and unwavering . readers under the age of eighteen read what I write with more passion , understanding , and clarity of perception than do adults . adults bog down , claim that I &apos;m difficult , obs@@ cur@@ anti@@ st , wilful , and sometimes simply trying to confuse . I &apos;m not ;
I &apos;m just trying to get the simple story simply told ... I didn &apos;t consciously set out to write for children , but somehow I connect with them . I think that &apos;s something to do with my psych@@ opath@@ ology , and I &apos;m not equipped to evaluate it . &quot; although Gar@@ ner &apos;s early work is often labelled as &quot; children &apos;s literature , &quot; Gar@@ ner himself rejects such a description , informing one interviewer that &quot; I certainly have never written for children &quot; but that instead he has always written purely for himself .
Gar@@ ner has spent much time investigating the areas that he deals with in his books ; writing in the &quot; Times Literary Supplement &quot; in 1968 , Gar@@ ner commented that in preparation for writing his book &quot; Eli@@ dor &quot; : :
I had to read extensively textbooks on physics , Celtic symbolism , unic@@ or@@ ns , medieval water@@ marks , meg@@ ali@@ thic archaeology ; study the writings of Jung ; brush up my Plato ; visit A@@ ve@@ bury , Sil@@ bury and Coven@@ try Cathedral ; spend a lot of time with demolition gangs on slum clearance sites ; and listen to the whole of Brit@@ ten &apos;s &quot; War Requi@@ em &quot; nearly every day .
</p>
<p>
in a paper published in the &quot; Children &apos;s Literature Association Quarterly &quot; , Maria Nikol@@ aj@@ eva characterised Gar@@ ner as &quot; one of the most controversial &quot; authors of modern children &apos;s literature .
in the fiftieth anniversary edition of &quot; The We@@ ir@@ d@@ stone of Bris@@ ing@@ amen &quot; , published by Har@@ per@@ Collins in 2010 , several notable British fantasy novel@@ ists praised Gar@@ ner and his work .
Susan Cooper related that &quot; The power and range of Alan Gar@@ ner &apos;s astounding talent has grown with every book he &apos;s written , &quot; whilst David Al@@ mond called him one of Britain &apos;s &quot; greatest writers &quot; whose works &quot; really matter . &quot; Philip Pul@@ lman , the author of the &quot; His Dark Materials &quot; tril@@ ogy , went further when he remarked that : :
</p>
<p>
the biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustr@@ ator of children &apos;s books .
Gar@@ ner was the sole runner @-@ up for the writing award in 1978 .
Gar@@ ner was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to literature in the 2001 New Year &apos;s Hon@@ ours list .
he received the British F@@ ant@@ asy Society &apos;s occasional Karl Edward Wagner Award in 2003 and the World F@@ ant@@ asy Award for Life Achievement in 2012 .
in January 2011 , the University of War@@ wick awarded the degree of Doctor of Letters .
on that occasion he gave a half @-@ hour interview about his work ..
he has also been awarded honorary doc@@ torates from the University of Sal@@ ford and the University of Hud@@ der@@ s@@ field in .
he has been recognised several times for particular works .

Afro Cel@@ t Sound System is a musical group who fuse electronic music with traditional Irish and West African music .
Afro Cel@@ t Sound System was formed in 1995 by producer @-@ guit@@ arist Simon Em@@ mer@@ son , and feature a wide range of guest artists .
in 2003 they temporarily changed their name to Afro@@ cel@@ ts before reverting to their original name .
their albums have been released through Peter Gabriel &apos;s Real World Records , and they have frequently performed at WO@@ MA@@ D festivals worldwide .
their sales on the label are exceeded only by Gabriel himself .
their recording contract with Real World was for five albums , of which &quot; Volume 5 : anatomic &quot; was the last .
after a number of festival dates in 2007 , the band went on hiatus .
in 2010 , they regrouped to play a number of shows , releasing a re @-@ mastered retrospective titled &quot; Cap@@ ture . &quot; on 20 May 2014 Afro Cel@@ t Sound System announced the upcoming release of a new album , &quot; Born &quot; .
in January 2016 , a posting to that website revealed that due to a dispute with Em@@ mer@@ son , who announced his departure from the band in 2015 , there were two active versions of the band , a version led by Em@@ mer@@ son and a separate line @-@ up headed by James McN@@ ally and Martin Russell .
Em@@ mer@@ son &apos;s version of the band released the album &quot; The Source &quot; in 2016 .
the dispute ended on December 21 , 2016 , with an announcement on social media .
</p>
<p>
the inspiration behind the project dates back to 1991 , when Simon Em@@ mer@@ son , a Gram@@ my Award @-@ nominated British producer and guit@@ arist , collaborated with Afro @-@ pop star Ba@@ aba Ma@@ al .
while making an album with Ma@@ al in Senegal , Em@@ mer@@ son was struck by the similarity between one African melody and a traditional Irish air .
back in London , Irish musician Dav@@ y S@@ pill@@ ane told Em@@ mer@@ son about a belief that nomadic Cel@@ ts lived in Africa or India before they migrated to Western Europe .
whether or not the theory was true , Em@@ mer@@ son was intrigued by the two countries &apos; musical aff@@ inities .
in an experiment that would prove successful , Em@@ mer@@ son brought two members of Ba@@ aba Ma@@ al &apos;s band together with traditional Irish musicians to see what kind of music the two groups would create .
adding a dash of modern sound , Em@@ mer@@ son also brought in English dance mix@@ ers for an electronic beat .
&quot; people thought I was mad when I touted the idea , &quot; Em@@ mer@@ son told Jim Car@@ roll of &quot; The Irish Times &quot; . &quot; at the time , I was out of favour with the London club scene . I was broke and on income support but the success was extraordinary . &quot; jamming in the studios at Real World , musician Peter Gabriel &apos;s recording facilities in Wil@@ t@@ shire , England , the diverse group of musicians recorded the basis of their first album in one week .
this album , &quot; &quot; , was released by Real World Records in 1996 , and marked the debut of the Afro Cel@@ t Sound System .
&quot; prior to that first album being made , none of us knew if it would work , &quot; musician James McN@@ ally told Larry Kat@@ z of the Boston Herald .
&quot; we were strangers who didn &apos;t even speak the same language . but we were bow@@ led over by this communication that took place beyond language . &quot; McN@@ ally , who grew up second @-@ generation Irish in London , played whist@@ les , keyboards , piano , bod@@ h@@ ran , and bamboo flute . &quot;
sound Magic &quot; has now sold over 300,000 copies .
the band performed at festivals , ra@@ ves , and dance clubs and regularly included two African musicians , Moussa Sis@@ so@@ k@@ ho on talking drum and dj@@ em@@ be and N &apos;@@ Fal@@ y Kou@@ y@@ ate on voc@@ als , k@@ ora and bal@@ af@@ on .
just as the second album was getting off the ground , one of the group &apos;s core musicians , 27 @-@ year @-@ old key@@ boar@@ dist Jo Bruce , died suddenly of an asthma attack .
the band was devastated , and the album was put on hold .
then Irish pop star Sin@@ é@@ ad O &apos;Connor came to the rescue , collaborating with the band and helping them cope with their loss .
&quot; &#91; O &apos;Connor &#93; blew into the studio on a windy November night and blew away again leaving us something incredibly emotional and powerful , &quot; McN@@ ally told Kat@@ z .
&quot; we had this track we didn &apos;t know what to do with . Sin@@ é@@ ad scri@@ bbled a few lyrics and bang ! she left us completely choked up . &quot; so taken was the band with O &apos;Connor &apos;s song , &quot; Release , &quot; that they used the name for the title of their album . &quot; &quot; hit the music stores in 1999 , and by the spring of 2000 it had sold more than half a million copies worldwide .
in 2000 the group was nominated for a Gram@@ my Award in the Best World Music category .
the band , composed at the time of eight members from six countries , took pride in its ability to bring people together through music .
&quot; we can communicate anywhere at any corner of the planet and feel that we &apos;re at home , &quot; McN@@ ally told Patrick Mac@@ Donald of The Seattle Times &quot; . &quot; we &apos;re breaking down categories of world music and rock music and black music .
we leave a door open to communicate with each other &apos;s traditions .
and it &apos;s changed our lives . &quot;
in 2001 the group released &quot; &quot; , which climbed to number one on Bill@@ board &apos;s Top World Music Alb@@ ums chart . featuring guest spots by Peter Gabriel and Robert Plant , the album also incorporated a heightened African sound . &quot; on the first two records , the pendulum swung more toward the Celtic , London club side of the equation , &quot; Em@@ mer@@ son told the Irish Times &apos;s Car@@ roll . &quot; for this one , we wanted to have more African voc@@ als and input than we &apos;d done before . &quot;
again the Afro Cel@@ t Sound System met with success . Chuck Taylor of Bill@@ board magazine praised the album as &quot; a cultural phenomenon that bursts past the traditional boundaries of contemporary music . &quot;
the single &quot; When You &apos;re F@@ alling , &quot; with voc@@ als by Gabriel , became a radio hit in the United States . in 2003 , for the &quot; Seed &quot; album , they changed their name to Afro@@ cel@@ ts . they reverted to the longer band name for their subsequent albums , &quot; Po@@ d &quot; , a compilation of new mixes of songs from the first four albums , &quot; &quot; , and &quot; Cap@@ ture - Afro Cel@@ t Sound System 1995 @-@ 2010 . &quot;
they played a number of shows to promote &quot; Volume 5 :
anatomic &quot; in 2006 and summer 2007 , ending with a gig in Korea , before taking an extended break to work on side projects , amongst them &quot; The Imag@@ ined Village &quot; featuring Simon Em@@ mer@@ son and Johnny Kal@@ si . starting in the summer of 2010 , the band performed a series of live shows to promote a new 2 @-@ CD album , &quot; Cap@@ ture - Afro Cel@@ t Sound System 1995 @-@ 2010 &quot; , released on 6 September 2010 on Real World Records . further performances continue to the present day , and a new album @-@ in @-@ progress titled &quot; Born &quot; was announced on their website in 2014 .
following the split , Em@@ mer@@ son &apos;s version of the band released the album The Source in 2016 .
</p>
<p>
during 2015 , the band had split into two formations , one of them including Simon Em@@ mer@@ son , N &apos;@@ Fal@@ y Kou@@ y@@ ate and Johnny Kal@@ si , the other one James McN@@ ally and Martin Russell .
the split was announced on the band &apos;s website in January 2016 .
the dispute officially ended with an announcement on social media on December 21 , 2016 .
</p>
<p>
when Afro Cel@@ t Sound System formed in the mid @-@ 1990s during the Real World Recording Week , the difference between a guest artist and a band member was virtually non @-@ existent .
however , over time , a combination of people became most often associated with the name Afro Cel@@ t Sound System .
the divided grouping of the band into two versions , both operating under the name Afro Cel@@ t Sound System , began in January 2016 and was resolved in December 2016 after McN@@ ally and Russell agreed to work under a different name from Em@@ mer@@ son .
Russell / McN@@ ally version Other musicians who have performed or recorded with Afro Cel@@ t Sound System include :

they also recorded the sound@@ track for the PC game &quot; Magic and May@@ hem &quot; , released in 1998 .

An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander ( ; Ἀ@@ ν@@ α@@ ξ@@ ί@@ μ@@ α@@ ν@@ δ@@ ρ@@ ο@@ ς &quot; An@@ a@@ xim@@ and@@ ros &quot; ; was a pre @-@ S@@ ocratic Greek philosopher who lived in Mil@@ etus , a city of I@@ onia .
he belonged to the Mil@@ esian school and learned the teachings of his master Thal@@ es .
he succeeded Thal@@ es and became the second master of that school where he counted An@@ axi@@ men@@ es and , arguably , Py@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as amongst his pupils .
little of his life and work is known today .
according to available historical documents , he is the first philosopher known to have written down his studies , although only one fragment of his work remains .
fragmentary testimonies found in documents after his death provide a portrait of the man .
he was an early proponent of science and tried to observe and explain different aspects of the universe , with a particular interest in its origins , claiming that nature is ruled by laws , just like human societies , and anything that disturbs the balance of nature does not last long .
like many thinkers of his time , An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s philosophy included contributions to many disciplines .
in astronomy , he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth .
in physics , his post@@ ulation that the indefinite was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction .
his knowledge of geometry allowed him to introduce the gn@@ omon in Greece .
he created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of geography .
he was also involved in the politics of Mil@@ etus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies .
</p>
<p>
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander , son of Pra@@ xi@@ ades , was born in the third year of the 42nd Olympiad .
according to Apol@@ lo@@ dor@@ us of Athens , Greek gramm@@ arian of the 2nd century BC , he was sixty @-@ four years old during the second year of the 58th Olympiad , and died shortly afterwards .
establishing a timeline of his work is now impossible , since no document provides chronological references .
Th@@ em@@ is@@ tius , a 4th @-@ century Byzantine rhetor@@ ician , mentions that he was the &quot; first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature . &quot; therefore , his texts would be amongst the earliest written in prose , at least in the Western world .
by the time of Plato , his philosophy was almost forgotten , and Aristotle , his successor The@@ oph@@ ra@@ st@@ us and a few do@@ x@@ ographers provide us with the little information that remains .
however , we know from Aristotle that Thal@@ es , also from Mil@@ etus , precedes An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander .
it is debatable whether Thal@@ es actually was the teacher of An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander , but there is no doubt that An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander was influenced by Thal@@ es &apos; theory that everything is derived from water .
one thing that is not debatable is that even the ancient Greeks considered An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander to be from the Mon@@ ist school which began in Mil@@ etus , with Thal@@ es followed by An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander and finished with An@@ axi@@ men@@ es .
3rd @-@ century Roman rhetor@@ ician A@@ el@@ ian depicts him as leader of the Mil@@ esian colony to Apol@@ lon@@ ia on the Black Sea coast , and hence some have inferred that he was a prominent citizen .
indeed , &quot; Various History &quot; explains that philosophers sometimes also dealt with political matters .
it is very likely that leaders of Mil@@ etus sent him there as a legislator to create a constitution or simply to maintain the colony &apos;s allegiance .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander lived the final few years of his life as a subject of the Persian Ac@@ ha@@ e@@ men@@ id Empire .
</p>
<p>
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s theories were influenced by the Greek mythical tradition , and by some ideas of Thal@@ es - the father of philosophy - as well as by observations made by older civilizations in the East .
all these were elaborated rationally .
in his desire to find some universal principle , he assumed , like traditional religion , the existence of a cosmic order ; and in elaborating his ideas on this he used the old mythical language which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality .
this was a common practice for the Greek philosophers in a society which saw gods everywhere , and therefore could fit their ideas into a toler@@ ably elastic system .
some scholars see a gap between the existing mythical and the new rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period in the Greek city @-@ states .
this has given rise to the phrase &quot; Greek miracle . &quot; but if we follow carefully the course of An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s ideas , we will notice that there was not such an abrupt break as initially appears .
the basic elements of nature which the first Greek philosophers believed constituted the universe represent in fact the primordial forces of previous thought .
their collision produced what the mythical tradition had called cosmic harmony .
in the old cosmo@@ g@@ onies - He@@ si@@ od and P@@ her@@ ec@@ y@@ des - Zeus establishes his order in the world by destroying the powers which were threatening this harmony .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander claimed that the cosmic order is not mon@@ arch@@ ic but geometric , and that this causes the equilibrium of the earth , which is lying in the centre of the universe .
this is the projection on nature of a new political order and a new space organized around a centre which is the static point of the system in the society as in nature .
in this space there is &quot; is@@ onomy &quot; and all the forces are symmetrical and transfer@@ rable .
the decisions are now taken by the assembly of &quot; dem@@ os &quot; in the &quot; ag@@ ora &quot; which is lying in the middle of the city .
the same &quot; rational &quot; way of thought led him to introduce the abstract &quot; ap@@ e@@ iron &quot; as an origin of the universe , a concept that is probably influenced by the original Cha@@ os of the mythical Greek cosmo@@ g@@ ony from which everything else appeared .
it also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements .
origin , then , must be something else unlimited in its source , that could create without experiencing decay , so that genesis would never stop .
</p>

the &quot; Refu@@ tation &quot; attributed to Hip@@ poly@@ tus of Rome , and the later 6th century Byzantine philosopher Simpl@@ ici@@ us of C@@ il@@ ic@@ ia , attribute to An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander the earliest use of the word &quot; ap@@ e@@ iron &quot; to designate the original principle .
he was the first philosopher to employ , in a philosophical context , the term &quot; arch@@ ē &quot; , which until then had meant beginning or origin .
for him , it became no longer a mere point in time , but a source that could perpetually give birth to whatever will be .
the in@@ defin@@ it@@ eness is spatial in early usages as in Homer and as in X@@ en@@ op@@ han@@ es who said that the earth went down indefinitely i.e. beyond the imagination or concept of men .
Aristotle writes that the Pre @-@ S@@ ocrati@@ cs were searching for the element that constitutes all things .
while each pre @-@ S@@ ocratic philosopher gave a different answer as to the identity of this element , An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander understood the beginning or first principle to be an endless , unlimited primordial mass , subject to neither old age nor decay , that perpetually yielded fresh materials from which everything we perceive is derived .
he proposed the theory of the &quot; ap@@ e@@ iron &quot; in direct response to the earlier theory of his teacher , Thal@@ es , who had claimed that the primary substance was water .
the notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious concept of immortality , and An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s description was in terms appropriate to this conception .
this &quot; arch@@ ē &quot; is called &quot; eternal and ag@@ eless . &quot; ( Hip@@ poly@@ tus , &quot; Refu@@ tation &quot; , I , 6 , I ;
DK B2 ) For An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander , the principle of things , the constituent of all substances , is nothing determined and not an element such as water in Thal@@ es &apos; view .
neither is it something halfway between air and water , or between air and fire , thicker than air and fire , or more subtle than water and earth .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander argues that water cannot embrace all of the opposites found in nature - for example , water can only be wet , never dry - and therefore cannot be the one primary substance ; nor could any of the other candidates .
he post@@ ulated the &quot; ap@@ e@@ iron &quot; as a substance that , although not directly perceptible to us , could explain the opposites he saw around him .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander explains how the four elements of ancient physics are formed , and how Earth and terrestrial beings are formed through their interactions .
unlike other Pre @-@ S@@ ocrati@@ cs , he never defines this principle precisely , and it has generally been understood as a sort of primal chaos .
according to him , the Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the primordial matter .
it embraces the opposites of hot and cold , wet and dry , and directs the movement of things ; an entire host of shapes and differences then grow that are found in &quot; all the worlds &quot; .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander maintains that all dying things are returning to the element from which they came .
the one surviving fragment of An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s writing deals with this matter .
Simpl@@ ici@@ us transmitted it as a quotation , which describes the balanced and mutual changes of the elements : Simpl@@ ici@@ us , &quot; Comments on Aristotle &apos;s Physics &quot; : :
consequently , deciding where they start and where they end is often difficult .
however , it is generally accepted that this quote is not Simpl@@ ici@@ us &apos; own interpretation , but An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s writing , in &quot; somewhat poetic terms &quot; as it is mentioned by Simpl@@ ici@@ us .
whence things have their origin , Th@@ ence also their destruction happens , According to necessity ;
for they give to each other justice and recompense For their injustice In conformity with the ordinance of Time .
Simpl@@ ici@@ us mentions that An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander said all these &quot; in poetic terms , &quot; meaning that he used the old mythical language .
the goddess Justice keeps the cosmic order .
this concept of returning to the element of origin was often revisited afterwards , notably by Aristotle , and by the Greek trage@@ dian E@@ uri@@ p@@ ides :
&quot; what comes from earth must return to earth . &quot; Friedrich Nietzsche , in his &quot; Philosophy in the Tra@@ gic Age of the Greeks &quot; , stated that An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander viewed ... &quot; all coming @-@ to @-@ be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being , a wrong for which destruction is the only pen@@ ance . &quot; physicist Max Born , in commenting upon Werner He@@ isen@@ berg &apos;s arriving at the idea that the elementary particles of quantum mechanics are to be seen as different manifestations , different quantum states , of one and the same &quot; primordial substance , &quot; &apos; proposed that this primordial substance be called &quot; ap@@ e@@ iron &quot; .

An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s bold use of non @-@ myth@@ ological explanatory hypotheses considerably distinguishes him from previous cosm@@ ology writers such as He@@ si@@ od .
it confirms that pre @-@ S@@ ocratic philosophers were making an early effort to dem@@ y@@ sti@@ fy physical processes .
his major contribution to history was writing the oldest prose document about the Universe and the origins of life ; for this he is often called the &quot; Father of Co@@ sm@@ ology &quot; and founder of astronomy .
however , pseudo @-@ Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch states that he still viewed celestial bodies as de@@ ities .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander was the first to conceive a mechanical model of the world .
in his model , the Earth floats very still in the centre of the infinite , not supported by anything .
it remains &quot; in the same place because of its indifference , &quot; a point of view that Aristotle considered ingenious , but false , in &quot; On the Heaven@@ s &quot; .
its curious shape is that of a cylinder with a height one @-@ third of its diameter .
the flat top forms the inhabited world , which is surrounded by a circular oceanic mass .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s realization that the Earth floats free without falling and does not need to be resting on something has been indicated by many as the first cosm@@ ological revolution and the starting point of scientific thinking .
Karl Pop@@ per calls this idea &quot; one of the b@@ oldest , most revolutionary , and most port@@ ent@@ ous ideas in the whole history of human thinking . &quot; such a model allowed the concept that celestial bodies could pass under the Earth , opening the way to Greek astronomy .
at the origin , after the separation of hot and cold , a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree .
this ball broke apart to form the rest of the Universe .
it resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels , filled with fire , with the ri@@ ms pierced by holes like those of a flute .
consequently , the Sun was the fire that one could see through a hole the same size as the Earth on the farthest wheel , and an eclipse corresponded with the occlusion of that hole .
the diameter of the solar wheel was twenty @-@ seven times that of the Earth and the lunar wheel , whose fire was less intense , eighteen times .
its hole could change shape , thus explaining lunar phases .
the stars and the planets , located closer , followed the same model@@ .@@ Most of An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s model of the Universe comes from pseudo @-@ Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch : :
furthermore , according to Di@@ o@@ genes La@@ er@@ tius , he built a celestial sphere .
this invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obl@@ iqu@@ ity of the Z@@ odiac as the Roman philosopher Pl@@ iny the Elder reports in &quot; Natural History &quot; .
it is a little early to use the term eclip@@ tic , but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons .
the do@@ x@@ ographer and the@@ ologi@@ an A@@ eti@@ us attributes to Py@@ th@@ ag@@ or@@ as the exact measurement of the obl@@ iqu@@ ity .
</p>
<p>
according to Simpl@@ ici@@ us , An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander already speculated on the plurality of worlds , similar to atom@@ ists Le@@ u@@ cip@@ pus and Dem@@ oc@@ rit@@ us , and later philosopher E@@ pic@@ urus .
these thinkers supposed that worlds appeared and disappeared for a while , and that some were born when others perished .
they claimed that this movement was eternal , &quot; for without movement , there can be no generation , no destruction . &quot; in addition to Simpl@@ ici@@ us , Hip@@ poly@@ tus reports An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s claim that from the infinite comes the principle of beings , which themselves come from the heavens and the worlds .
Cic@@ ero writes that he attributes different gods to the countless worlds . &quot;
on the Nature of the Gods &quot; : :
&quot; &quot; An@@ a@@ xim@@ and@@ ri aut@@ em opinio est n@@ ati@@ vos esse de@@ os long@@ is inter@@ v@@ all@@ is ori@@ entis oc@@ cid@@ enti@@ s@@ que , e@@ os@@ que innumer@@ abil@@ es esse mun@@ dos . &quot; &quot; :
&quot; for An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander , gods were born , but the time is long between their birth and their death ; and the worlds are countless . &quot; this theory places An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander close to the A@@ tom@@ ists and the E@@ pic@@ ure@@ ans who , more than a century later , also claimed that an infinity of worlds appeared and disappeared .
in the timeline of the Greek history of thought , some thinkers conceptualized a single world , while others instead speculated on the existence of a series of worlds , continuous or non @-@ continuous .
</p>
<p>
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander attributed some phenomena , such as thunder and lightning , to the intervention of elements , rather than to divine caus@@ es.@@ P@@ seud@@ o @-@ Pl@@ u@@ tar@@ ch : :
&quot; An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander claims that all this is done by the wind , for when it happens to be enclosed in a thick cloud , then by its subtlety and lightness , the rupture produces the sound ; and the scattering , because of the darkness of the cloud , creates the light . &quot; in his system , thunder results from the shock of clouds hitting each other ; the lou@@ dness of the sound is proportionate with that of the shock .
Th@@ under without lightning is the result of the wind being too weak to emit any flame , but strong enough to produce a sound .
a flash of lightning without thunder is a jolt of the air that dispers@@ es and falls , allowing a less active fire to break free .
Th@@ under@@ bolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow .
he saw the sea as a remnant of the mass of humidity that once surrounded Earth .
a part of that mass evaporated under the sun &apos;s action , thus causing the winds and even the rotation of the celestial bodies , which he believed were attracted to places where water is more abundant .
he explained rain as a product of the humidity pumped up from Earth by the sun .
for him , the Earth was slowly drying up and water only remained in the deepest regions , which someday would go dry as well .
according to Aristotle &apos;s &quot; Meteorology &quot; , Dem@@ oc@@ rit@@ us also shared this opinion .
</p>
<p>
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander speculated about the beginnings and origin of animal life .
taking into account the existence of fossils , he claimed that animals sprang out of the sea long ago .
the first animals were born trapped in a spin@@ y bark , but as they got older , the bark would dry up and break .
as the early humidity evaporated , dry land emerged and , in time , humankind had to adapt .
the 3rd century Roman writer C@@ ens@@ or@@ in@@ us reports : text = An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander of Mil@@ etus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fish@@ like animals .
inside these animals , men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty ; only then , after these animals burst open , could men and women come out , now able to feed themselves .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander put forward the idea that humans had to spend part of this transition inside the mouths of big fish to protect themselves from the Earth &apos;s climate until they could come out in open air and lose their scales .
he thought that , considering humans &apos; extended infancy , we could not have survived in the prim@@ eval world in the same manner we do presently .
</p>
<p>
both Stra@@ bo and Aga@@ them@@ erus claim that , according to the geograph@@ er Er@@ at@@ os@@ then@@ es , An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander was the first to publish a map of the world .
the map probably inspired the Greek historian H@@ ec@@ at@@ a@@ eus of Mil@@ etus to draw a more accurate version .
Stra@@ bo viewed both as the first geograph@@ ers after Homer .
maps were produced in ancient times , also notably in Egypt , Lydia , the Middle East , and Babylon .
only some small examples survived until today .
the unique example of a world map comes from late Babylon@@ ian tablet BM 9@@ 26@@ 87 later than 9th century BC but is based probably on a much older map .
these maps indicated directions , roads , towns , borders , and geological features .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s innovation was to represent the entire inhabited land known to the ancient Greeks .
such an accomplishment is more significant than it at first appears .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander most likely drew this map for three reasons .
first , it could be used to improve navigation and trade between Mil@@ etus &apos;s colonies and other colonies around the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea .
second , Thal@@ es would probably have found it easier to convince the I@@ onian city @-@ states to join in a federation in order to push the Me@@ dian threat away if he possessed such a tool .
finally , the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one .
surely aware of the sea &apos;s conv@@ ex@@ ity , he may have designed his map on a slightly rounded metal surface .
the centre or &quot; nav@@ el &quot; of the world could have been Delphi , but is more likely in An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s time to have been located near Mil@@ etus .
the Aegean Sea was near the map &apos;s centre and enclosed by three continents , themselves located in the middle of the ocean and isolated like islands by sea and rivers .
Europe was bordered on the south by the Mediterranean Sea and was separated from Asia by the Black Sea , the Lake Ma@@ e@@ oti@@ s , and , further east , either by the P@@ ha@@ sis River or the Tan@@ ais .
the Nile flowed south into the ocean , separating Libya from Asia .
</p>
<p>
the &quot; Sud@@ a &quot; relates that An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander explained some basic notions of geometry .
it also mentions his interest in the measurement of time and associates him with the introduction in Greece of the gn@@ omon .
in Lac@@ ed@@ a@@ em@@ on , he participated in the construction , or at least in the adjustment , of sun@@ di@@ als to indicate sol@@ stic@@ es and equ@@ in@@ ox@@ es .
indeed , a gn@@ omon required adjustments from a place to another because of the difference in latitude .
in his time , the gn@@ omon was simply a vertical pillar or rod mounted on a horizontal plane .
the position of its shadow on the plane indicated the time of day .
as it moves through its apparent course , the Sun draws a curve with the tip of the projected shadow , which is shortest at noon , when pointing due south .
the variation in the tip &apos;s position at noon indicates the solar time and the seasons ; the shadow is longest on the winter sol@@ sti@@ ce and shortest on the summer sol@@ sti@@ ce .
the invention of the gn@@ omon itself cannot be attributed to An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander because its use , as well as the division of days into twelve parts , came from the Babylon@@ ians .
it is they , according to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; Hist@@ ories , who gave the Greeks the art of time measurement .
it is likely that he was not the first to determine the sol@@ stic@@ es , because no calculation is necessary .
on the other hand , equ@@ in@@ ox@@ es do not correspond to the middle point between the positions during sol@@ stic@@ es , as the Babylon@@ ians thought .
as the &quot; Sud@@ a &quot; seems to suggest , it is very likely that with his knowledge of geometry , he became the first Greek to accurately determine the equ@@ in@@ ox@@ es .
</p>
<p>
in his philosophical work De Di@@ vin@@ ati@@ one , Cic@@ ero states that An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander convinced the inhabitants of Lac@@ ed@@ a@@ em@@ on to abandon their city and spend the night in the country with their weapons because an earthquake was near .
the city collapsed when the top of the Tay@@ ge@@ tus split like the stern of a ship .
Pl@@ iny the Elder also mentions this anecdote , suggesting that it came from an &quot; admirable inspiration , &quot; as opposed to Cic@@ ero , who did not associate the prediction with div@@ ination .
</p>
<p>
Bertrand Russell in the &quot; History of Western Philosophy &quot; interprets An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s theories as an assertion of the necessity of an appropriate balance between earth , fire , and water , all of which may be independently seeking to ag@@ grandi@@ ze their proportions relative to the others .
An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander seems to express his belief that a natural order ensures balance between these elements , that where there was fire , ashes now exist .
his Greek peers echoed this sentiment with their belief in natural boundaries beyond which not even the gods could operate .
Friedrich Nietzsche , in &quot; Philosophy in the Tra@@ gic Age of the Greeks &quot; , claimed that An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander was a pessimist who asserted that the primal being of the world was a state of in@@ defin@@ it@@ eness .
in accordance with this , anything definite has to eventually pass back into in@@ defin@@ it@@ eness .
in other words , An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander viewed ... &quot; all coming @-@ to @-@ be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being , a wrong for which destruction is the only pen@@ ance . &quot; the world of individual objects , in this way of thinking , has no worth and should perish .
Martin Hei@@ deg@@ ger lectured extensively on An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander , and delivered a lecture entitled &quot; An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander &apos;s S@@ aying &quot; which was subsequently included in &quot; Off the Be@@ aten Track &quot; .
the lecture examines the ont@@ ological difference and the oblivion of Being or &quot; D@@ ase@@ in &quot; in the context of the An@@ a@@ xim@@ ander fragment .
Hei@@ deg@@ ger &apos;s lecture is , in turn , an important influence on the French philosopher Jacques Der@@ ri@@ da .

Ale@@ ister Crow@@ ley was an English oc@@ cul@@ tist , ceremonial magician , poet , painter , novelist , and mountain@@ eer .
he founded the religion of Thel@@ ema , identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the Æ@@ on of Hor@@ us in the early 20th century .
a prolific writer , he published widely over the course of his life .
born to a wealthy family in Royal Le@@ am@@ ington S@@ pa , War@@ w@@ ick@@ shire , Crow@@ ley rejected his parent &apos;s fundamentalist Christian Plymouth Bre@@ thren faith to pursue an interest in Western eso@@ ter@@ icism .
he was educated at the University of Cambridge , where he focused his attentions on mountain@@ eering and poetry , resulting in several publications .
some bi@@ ographers allege that here he was recruited into a British intelligence agency , further suggesting that he remained a spy throughout his life .
in 1898 he joined the esoteric Her@@ metic Order of the Golden Dawn , where he was trained in ceremonial magic by Samuel Lid@@ dell Mac@@ Greg@@ or Ma@@ thers and Allan Bennett .
moving to B@@ oles@@ kine House by Lo@@ ch N@@ ess in Scotland , he went mountain@@ eering in Mexico with Oscar Eck@@ en@@ stein , before studying Hindu and Buddhist practices in India .
he married Rose Edith Kelly and in 1904 they honey@@ mo@@ oned in Cairo , Egypt , where Crow@@ ley claimed to have been contacted by a supernatural entity named Ai@@ w@@ ass , who provided him with &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; , a sacred text that served as the basis for Thel@@ ema .
announcing the start of the Æ@@ on of Hor@@ us , &quot; The Book &quot; declared that its followers should &quot; Do what thou wilt &quot; and seek to align themselves with their True Will through the practice of mag@@ ick .
after an unsuccessful attempt to climb K@@ anch@@ en@@ jun@@ ga and a visit to India and China , Crow@@ ley returned to Britain , where he attracted attention as a prolific author of poetry , novels , and occult literature .
in 1907 , he and George Cec@@ il Jones co @-@ founded an esoteric order , the A ∴ A ∴ , through which they propagated Thel@@ ema .
after spending time in Algeria , in 1912 he was initiated into another esoteric order , the German @-@ based Or@@ do Tem@@ pl@@ i Ori@@ entis , rising to become the leader of its British branch , which he reformulated in accordance with his Thel@@ emite beliefs .
through the O.@@ T.@@ O. , Thel@@ emite groups were established in Britain , Australia , and North America .
Crow@@ ley spent the First World War in the United States , where he took up painting and campaigned for the German war effort against Britain , later revealing that he had infiltrated the pro @-@ German movement to assist the British intelligence services .
in 1920 he established the Abbey of Thel@@ ema , a religious commune in C@@ ef@@ al@@ ù , Sicily where he lived with various followers .
his liber@@ tine lifestyle led to den@@ unciations in the British press , and the Italian government evicted him in 1923 .
he divided the following two decades between France , Germany , and England , and continued to promote Thel@@ ema until his death .
Crow@@ ley gained widespread notori@@ ety during his lifetime , being a recreational drug experi@@ men@@ ter , bisexual and an individu@@ alist social critic .
he was denounced in the popular press as &quot; the wic@@ ke@@ dest man in the world &quot; and a Sat@@ anist .
Crow@@ ley has remained a highly influential figure over Western eso@@ ter@@ icism and the counter@@ culture , and continues to be considered a prophet in Thel@@ ema .
he is the subject of various bi@@ ographies and academic studies .

Crow@@ ley was born as Edward Alexander Crow@@ ley at 30 Clar@@ end@@ on Square in Royal Le@@ am@@ ington S@@ pa , War@@ w@@ ick@@ shire , on 12 October 18@@ 75 .
his father , Edward Crow@@ ley , was trained as an engineer , but his share in a lucrative family brewing business , Crow@@ ley &apos;s Al@@ ton A@@ les , had allowed him to retire before his son was born .
his mother , Emily Bertha Bishop , came from a Dev@@ on@@ shire @-@ Som@@ er@@ set family and had a strained relationship with her son ; she described him as &quot; the Be@@ ast , &quot; a name that he revel@@ led in .
the couple had been married at London &apos;s K@@ ens@@ ington Registry Office in November 1874 , and were evangelical Christians .
Crow@@ ley &apos;s father had been born a Qu@@ aker , but had converted to the Exclusive Bre@@ thren , a faction of a Christian fundamentalist group known as the Plymouth Bre@@ thren , with Emily joining him upon marriage .
Crow@@ ley &apos;s father was particularly devout , spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible to his wife and son after breakfast every day .
following the death of their baby daughter in 1880 , in 18@@ 81 the Crow@@ leys moved to Red@@ hill , Surrey .
at the age of 8 , Crow@@ ley was sent to H.@@ T. Hab@@ er@@ sh@@ on &apos;s evangelical Christian boarding school in Has@@ tings , and then to E@@ bor preparatory school in Cambridge , run by the Reverend Henry d &apos;@@ Ar@@ cy Champ@@ ney , whom Crow@@ ley considered a sad@@ ist .
in March 1887 , when Crow@@ ley was 11 , his father died of tongue cancer .
Crow@@ ley described this as a turning point in his life , and he always maintained an admiration of his father , describing him as &quot; my hero and my friend . &quot; inheriting a third of his father &apos;s wealth , he began mis@@ behaving at school and was harshly punished by Champ@@ ney ;
Crow@@ ley &apos;s family removed him from the school when he developed alb@@ umin@@ uria .
he then attended Mal@@ ver@@ n College and Ton@@ bridge School , both of which he despised and left after a few terms .
he became increasingly skeptical regarding Christianity , pointing out inconsistencies in the Bible to his religious teachers , and went against the Christian morality of his upbringing by smoking , mastur@@ b@@ ating , and having sex with prostitutes from whom he contracted gon@@ orrhea .
sent to live with a Bre@@ thren tutor in East@@ bourne , he undertook chemistry courses at East@@ bourne College .
Crow@@ ley developed interests in chess , poetry , and mountain climbing , and in 1894 climbed Be@@ ach@@ y Head before visiting the Alps and joining the Scottish Moun@@ tain@@ eering Club .
the following year he returned to the Bern@@ ese Alps , climbing the E@@ ig@@ er , Tri@@ ft , Jun@@ g@@ fra@@ u , M@@ ö@@ n@@ ch , and Wet@@ ter@@ horn .
</p>
<p>
having adopted the name of Ale@@ ister over Edward , in October 18@@ 95 Crow@@ ley began a three @-@ year course at Trinity College , Cambridge , where he was entered for the Moral Science Tri@@ pos studying philosophy .
with approval from his personal tutor , he changed to English literature , which was not then part of the curriculum offered .
Crow@@ ley spent much of his time at university engaged in his pas@@ times , becoming president of the chess club and practising the game for two hours a day ; he briefly considered a professional career as a chess player .
Crow@@ ley also embraced his love of literature and poetry , particularly the works of Richard Francis Burton and Percy B@@ ys@@ she Shelley .
many of his own poems appeared in student publications such as &quot; The Gran@@ ta &quot; , &quot; Cambridge Magazine &quot; , and &quot; Can@@ tab &quot; .
he continued his mountain@@ eering , going on holiday to the Alps to climb every year from 1894 to 1898 , often with his friend Oscar Eck@@ en@@ stein , and in 18@@ 97 he made the first ascent of the M@@ ö@@ n@@ ch without a guide .
these feats led to his recognition in the Alpine mountain@@ eering community .
for many years I had lo@@ athed being called A@@ lick , partly because of the unpleasant sound and sight of the word , partly because it was the name by which my mother called me .
Edward did not seem to suit me and the dimin@@ u@@ tives Ted or N@@ ed were even less appropriate .
Alexander was too long and Sandy suggested tow hair and freck@@ les .
I had read in some book or other that the most favourable name for becoming famous was one consisting of a d@@ ac@@ tyl followed by a spon@@ dee , as at the end of a h@@ exam@@ eter : like &quot; Jeremy Taylor &quot; .
Ale@@ ister Crow@@ ley fulfilled these conditions and Ale@@ ister is the Ga@@ elic form of Alexander .
to adopt it would satisfy my romantic ideals .
Crow@@ ley had his first significant mystical experience while on holiday in Stockholm in December 1896 .
several bi@@ ographers , including Lawrence Su@@ tin , Richard Kac@@ z@@ ynski , and Tob@@ ias Chur@@ ton , believed that this was the result of Crow@@ ley &apos;s first same @-@ sex sexual experience , which enabled him to recognise his bis@@ exuality .
at Cambridge , Crow@@ ley maintained a vigorous sex life with women - largely with female prostitutes , from one of whom he caught syphilis - but eventually he took part in same @-@ sex activities , despite their illegality .
in October 18@@ 97 , Crow@@ ley met Herbert Charles Pol@@ lit@@ t , president of the Cambridge University Foot@@ lights Dra@@ matic Club , and the two entered into a relationship .
they broke apart because Pol@@ lit@@ t did not share Crow@@ ley &apos;s increasing interest in Western eso@@ ter@@ icism , a break @-@ up that Crow@@ ley would regret for many years .
in 18@@ 97 , Crow@@ ley travelled to Saint Petersburg in Russia , later claiming that he was trying to learn Russian as he was considering a future diplomatic career there .
bi@@ ographers Richard Sp@@ ence and Tob@@ ias Chur@@ ton suggested that Crow@@ ley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service , spec@@ ulating that he had been enlisted while at Cambridge .
in October 18@@ 97 , a brief illness triggered considerations of mortality and &quot; the futility of all human endeavour , &quot; and Crow@@ ley abandoned all thoughts of a diplomatic career in favour of pursuing an interest in the occult .
in March 1898 , he obtained A.@@ E. Wa@@ ite &apos;s &quot; The Book of Black Magic and of P@@ acts &quot; , and then Karl von Eck@@ art@@ sha@@ us@@ en &apos;s &quot; The Cloud Upon the Sanc@@ tuary &quot; , furthering his occult interests .
in 1898 Crow@@ ley privately published 100 copies of his poem &quot; Ac@@ el@@ dam@@ a : a Place to Bur@@ y Str@@ angers In &quot; , but it was not a particular success .
that same year he published a string of other poems , including &quot; White S@@ tains &quot; , a Dec@@ ad@@ ent collection of erotic poetry that was printed abroad lest its publication be prohibited by the British authorities .
in July 1898 , he left Cambridge , not having taken any degree at all despite a &quot; first class &quot; showing in his 18@@ 97 exams and consistent &quot; second class honours &quot; results before that .
</p>
<p>
in August 1898 , Crow@@ ley was in Zer@@ mat@@ t , Switzerland , where he met the chemist Julian L. Baker , and the two began discussing their common interest in al@@ chemy .
back in London , Baker introduced Crow@@ ley to George Cec@@ il Jones , Baker &apos;s brother in @-@ law , and a fellow member of the occult society known as the Her@@ metic Order of the Golden Dawn , which had been founded in 1888 .
Crow@@ ley was initiated into the Outer Order of the Golden Dawn on 18 November 1898 by the group &apos;s leader , Samuel Lid@@ dell Mac@@ Greg@@ or Ma@@ thers .
the ceremony took place in the Golden Dawn &apos;s I@@ sis @-@ Uran@@ ia Temple held at London &apos;s Mark Mas@@ ons Hall , where Crow@@ ley took the magical motto and name &quot; Fr@@ ater Per@@ du@@ ra@@ bo , &quot; which he interpreted as &quot; I shall endure to the end . &quot; bi@@ ographers Richard Sp@@ ence and Tob@@ ias Chur@@ ton have suggested that Crow@@ ley joined the Order under the command of the British secret services to monitor the activities of Ma@@ thers , who was known to be a Car@@ list .
Crow@@ ley moved into his own luxury flat at 67 @-@ 69 Chan@@ cery Lane and soon invited a senior Golden Dawn member , Allan Bennett , to live with him as his personal magical tutor .
Bennett taught Crow@@ ley more about ceremonial magic and the ritual use of drugs , and together they performed the rituals of the &quot; Go@@ e@@ tia &quot; , until Bennett left for South Asia to study Buddhism .
in November 1899 , Crow@@ ley purchased B@@ oles@@ kine House in Fo@@ yers on the shore of Lo@@ ch N@@ ess in Scotland .
he developed a love of Scottish culture , describing himself as the &quot; L@@ aird of B@@ oles@@ kine , &quot; and took to wearing traditional highland dress , even during visits to London .
he continued writing poetry , publishing &quot; Je@@ ze@@ bel and Other Tra@@ gic Po@@ ems &quot; , &quot; T@@ ales of Ar@@ cha@@ is &quot; , &quot; Son@@ gs of the Spirit &quot; , &quot; Appeal to the American Republic &quot; , and &quot; J@@ eph@@ thah &quot; in 1898 @-@ 99 ; most gained mixed reviews from literary critics , although &quot; J@@ eph@@ thah &quot; was considered a particular critical success .
Crow@@ ley soon progressed through the lower grades of the Golden Dawn , and was ready to enter the group &apos;s inner Second Order .
he was unpopular in the group ; his bis@@ exuality and liber@@ tine lifestyle had gained him a bad reputation , and he had developed feud@@ s with some of the members , including W. B. Ye@@ ats .
when the Golden Dawn &apos;s London lodge refused to initiate Crow@@ ley into the Second Order , he visited Ma@@ thers in Paris , who personally admitted him into the A@@ dep@@ tus Minor Grade .
a sch@@ ism had developed between Ma@@ thers and the London members of the Golden Dawn , who were unhappy with his autocratic rule .
acting under Ma@@ thers &apos; orders , Crow@@ ley - with the help of his mistress and fellow initiate El@@ aine Simpson - attempted to seize the Va@@ ult of the A@@ depts , a temple space at 36 B@@ ly@@ the Road in West K@@ ens@@ ington , from the London lodge members .
when the case was taken to court , the judge ruled in favour of the London lodge , as they had paid for the space &apos;s rent , leaving both Crow@@ ley and Ma@@ thers isolated from the group .
Sp@@ ence suggested that the entire scenario was part of an intelligence operation to undermine Ma@@ thers &apos; authority .

in 1900 , Crow@@ ley travelled to Mexico via the United States , settling in Mexico City and starting a relationship with a local woman .
developing a love of the country , he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic , working with John De@@ e &apos;s E@@ no@@ ch@@ ian inv@@ oc@@ ations .
he later claimed to have been initiated into Fre@@ em@@ as@@ onry while there , and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner &apos;s &quot; T@@ ann@@ h@@ ä@@ user &quot; as well as a series of poems , published as &quot; Or@@ acles &quot; .
Eck@@ en@@ stein joined him later that year , and together they climbed several mountains , including Iz@@ tac@@ ci@@ hu@@ at@@ l , Popo@@ cat@@ e@@ pet@@ l , and Col@@ ima , the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption .
Sp@@ ence has suggested that the purpose of the trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence .
leaving Mexico , Crow@@ ley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the &quot; Nippon Mar@@ u &quot; .
on the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers ; saying he had fallen in love with her , he wrote a series of poems about the romance , published as &quot; Alice : an Ad@@ ul@@ tery &quot; .
briefly stopping in Japan and Hong Kong , Crow@@ ley reached Cey@@ lon , where he met with Allan Bennett , who was there studying Sha@@ i@@ vism .
the pair spent some time in Kan@@ dy before Bennett decided to become a Buddhist monk in the Ther@@ av@@ ada tradition , travelling to Burma to do so .
Crow@@ ley decided to tour India , devoting himself to the Hindu practice of &quot; R@@ ā@@ ja yoga &quot; , from which he claimed to have achieved the spiritual state of &quot; d@@ hy@@ ana &quot; .
he spent much of this time studying at the Me@@ en@@ ak@@ shi Temple in Mad@@ ura .
at this time he also composed and also wrote poetry which was published as &quot; The S@@ word of Song &quot; .
he contracted malaria , and had to recuper@@ ate from the disease in Calcutta and Ran@@ goon .
in 19@@ 02 , he was joined in India by Eck@@ en@@ stein and several other mountain@@ eers :
guy Know@@ les , H. Pf@@ ann@@ l , V. W@@ ess@@ el@@ ey , and Jules Jac@@ ot @-@ Guill@@ ar@@ mo@@ d .
together the Eck@@ en@@ stein @-@ Crow@@ ley expedition attempted K@@ 2 , which had never been climbed .
on the journey , Crow@@ ley was afflicted with influenza , malaria , and snow blindness , and other expedition members were also struck with illness .
they reached an altitude of before turning back .
having arrived in Paris in November 19@@ 02 he soci@@ alised with friend and future brother @-@ in @-@ law , the painter Gerald Kelly , and through him became a fixture of the Pari@@ sian arts scene .
whilst there , Crow@@ ley wrote a series of poems on the work of an acquaintance , the sculptor Augu@@ ste Ro@@ din .
these poems were later published as &quot; Ro@@ din in R@@ ime &quot; .
one of those frequ@@ enting this milieu was W. Som@@ er@@ set Mau@@ g@@ ham , who after briefly meeting Crow@@ ley later used him as a model for the character of Oliver Had@@ do in his novel &quot; The Mag@@ ician &quot; .
returning to B@@ oles@@ kine in April 1903 , in August Crow@@ ley wed Gerald &apos;s sister Rose Edith Kelly in a &quot; marriage of convenience &quot; to prevent her entering an arranged marriage ; the marriage appalled the Kelly family and damaged his friendship with Gerald .
heading on a honeymoon to Paris , Cairo , and then Cey@@ lon , Crow@@ ley fell in love with Rose and worked to prove his affections .
while on his honeymoon , he wrote her a series of love poems , published as &quot; Rosa Mun@@ di and other Love Son@@ gs &quot; , as well as auth@@ oring the religious satire &quot; Why Jesus W@@ ept &quot; .

in February 1904 , Crow@@ ley and Rose arrived in Cairo .
claiming to be a prince and princess , they rented an apartment in which Crow@@ ley set up a temple room and began invoking ancient Egyptian de@@ ities , while studying Islamic mys@@ ticism and Arabic .
Crow@@ ley thought it important that the exhibit &apos;s number was 666 , the Number of the Be@@ ast in Christian belief , and in later years termed the arte@@ fact the &quot; St@@ ele of Rev@@ eal@@ ing . &quot; according to Crow@@ ley &apos;s later statements , on 8 April he heard a dis@@ embodied voice that claimed to be that of Ai@@ w@@ ass , the messenger of Hor@@ us , or Ho@@ or @-@ Pa@@ ar @-@ Kra@@ at .
Crow@@ ley said that he wrote down everything the voice told him over the course of the next three days , and titled it &quot; Li@@ ber AL vel Leg@@ is &quot; or &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; .
the book proclaimed that humanity was entering a new A@@ eon , and that Crow@@ ley would serve as its prophet .
it stated that a supreme moral law was to be introduced in this A@@ eon , &quot; Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law , &quot; and that people should learn to live in tune with their Will .
this book , and the philosophy that it espoused , became the cornerstone of Crow@@ ley &apos;s religion , Thel@@ ema .
Crow@@ ley said that at the time he had been unsure what to do with &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; .
often res@@ enting it , he said that he ignored the instructions which the text commanded him to perform , which included taking the St@@ ele of Rev@@ eal@@ ing from the museum , forti@@ fying his own island , and translating the book into all the world &apos;s languages .
according to his account , he instead sent types@@ cripts of the work to several oc@@ cul@@ tists he knew , putting the manuscript away and ignoring it .
</p>
<p>
returning to B@@ oles@@ kine , Crow@@ ley came to believe that Ma@@ thers had begun using magic against him , and the relationship between the two broke down .
on 28 July 1905 , Rose gave birth to Crow@@ ley &apos;s first child , a daughter named L@@ ili@@ th , with Crow@@ ley writing the pornographic &quot; Snow@@ drops From a Cur@@ ate &apos;s Garden &quot; to entertain his recuper@@ ating wife .
he also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry , naming it the Society for the Prop@@ ag@@ ation of Religious Truth in par@@ ody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge .
among its first publications were Crow@@ ley &apos;s &quot; Collec@@ ted Works &quot; , edited by Iv@@ or Back .
his poetry often received strong reviews , but never sold well .
in an attempt to gain more publicity , he issued a reward of £ 100 for the best essay on his work .
the winner of this was J. F. C. Fuller , a British Army officer and military historian , whose essay , &quot; The Star in the West &quot; , heralded Crow@@ ley &apos;s poetry as some of the greatest ever written .
Crow@@ ley decided to climb K@@ anch@@ en@@ jun@@ ga in the Himalayas of Nepal , widely recognised as the world &apos;s most treacherous mountain .
assembling a team consisting of Jac@@ ot @-@ Guill@@ ar@@ mo@@ d , Charles Adol@@ phe Re@@ y@@ mond , Alexis Pac@@ he , and Al@@ c@@ esti C. Rig@@ o de Ri@@ ghi , the expedition was marred by much argument between Crow@@ ley and the others , who thought that he was reckless .
they eventually mutin@@ ied against Crow@@ ley &apos;s control , with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crow@@ ley &apos;s warnings that it was too dangerous .
subsequently , Pac@@ he and several porters were killed in an accident , something for which Crow@@ ley was widely blamed by the mountain@@ eering community .
spending time in Mo@@ harb@@ han@@ j , where he took part in big @-@ game hunting and wrote the homo@@ erotic work &quot; The Sc@@ ented Garden &quot; , Crow@@ ley met up with Rose and L@@ ili@@ th in Calcutta before being forced to leave India after shooting dead an Indian man who tried to mug him .
briefly visiting Bennett in Burma , Crow@@ ley and his family decided to tour Southern China , hiring porters and a nanny for the purpose .
Sp@@ ence has suggested that this trip to China was orchestrated as part of a British intelligence scheme to monitor the region &apos;s opium trade .
Crow@@ ley smoked opium throughout the journey , which took the family from Teng@@ yu@@ eh through to Yun@@ g@@ chang , T@@ ali , Yun@@ nan@@ fu , and then Hanoi .
on the way he spent much time on spiritual and magical work , re@@ citing the &quot; Bor@@ n@@ less R@@ itual , &quot; an invocation to his Holy Guardian Angel , on a daily basis .
while Rose and L@@ ili@@ th returned to Europe , Crow@@ ley headed to Shanghai to meet old friend El@@ aine Simpson , who was fascinated by &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; ; together they performed rituals in an attempt to contact Ai@@ w@@ ass .
Crow@@ ley then sailed to Japan and Canada , before continuing to New York City , where he unsuccessfully solicited support for a second expedition up K@@ anch@@ en@@ jun@@ ga .
upon arrival in Britain , Crow@@ ley learned that his daughter L@@ ili@@ th had died of typhoid in Ran@@ goon , something he later blamed on Rose &apos;s increasing alcoholism .
under emotional distress , his health began to suffer , and he underwent a series of surgical operations .
he began short @-@ lived rom@@ ances with actress Vera &quot; Lola &quot; Neville and author Ad@@ a L@@ ever@@ son , while Rose gave birth to Crow@@ ley &apos;s second daughter , Lola Z@@ aza , in February 1907 .
</p>
<p>
with his old mentor George Cec@@ il Jones , Crow@@ ley continued performing the Abra@@ mel@@ in rituals at the Ash@@ down Park Hotel in C@@ oul@@ s@@ don , Surrey .
Crow@@ ley claimed that in doing so he attained &quot; sam@@ ad@@ hi &quot; , or union with God@@ head , thereby marking a turning point in his life .
making heavy use of hash@@ ish during these rituals , he wrote an essay on &quot; The Psychology of Hash@@ ish &quot; in which he championed the drug as an aid to mys@@ ticism .
he also claimed to have been contacted once again by Ai@@ w@@ ass in late October and November 1907 , adding that Ai@@ w@@ ass dictated two further texts to him , &quot; Li@@ ber VII &quot; and &quot; Li@@ ber Cord@@ is C@@ inc@@ ti Ser@@ p@@ ente , &quot; both of which were later classified in the corpus of The Holy Books of Thel@@ ema .
Crow@@ ley wrote down more Thel@@ emic Holy Books during the last two months of the year , including &quot; Li@@ ber L@@ XVI , &quot; &quot; Li@@ ber Ar@@ can@@ orum , &quot; &quot; Li@@ ber Por@@ ta Luc@@ is , Sub Fig@@ ura X , &quot; &quot; Li@@ ber Tau , &quot; &quot; Li@@ ber Tri@@ gram@@ mat@@ on &quot; and &quot; Li@@ ber D@@ CC@@ C@@ XIII vel Ar@@ ar@@ ita , &quot; which he again claimed to have received from a pre@@ ter@@ natural source .
Crow@@ ley stated that in June 19@@ 09 , when the manuscript of &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; was re@@ discovered at B@@ oles@@ kine , he developed the opinion that Thel@@ ema represented objective truth .
Crow@@ ley &apos;s inheritance was running out .
trying to earn money , he was hired by George Mon@@ tag@@ u Bennett , the Earl of Tan@@ ker@@ ville , to help protect him from witchcraft ; recognising Bennett &apos;s paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction , Crow@@ ley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuper@@ ate .
in 1907 , he also began taking in paying students , whom he instructed in occult and magical practice .
Victor Neub@@ urg , whom Crow@@ ley met in February 1907 , became his sexual partner and closest disciple ; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tan@@ gi@@ er , Morocco .
the following year Neub@@ urg stayed at B@@ oles@@ kine , where he and Crow@@ ley engaged in sad@@ om@@ as@@ och@@ ism .
Crow@@ ley continued to write pro@@ lif@@ ically , producing such works of poetry as &quot; Am@@ ber@@ gr@@ is &quot; , &quot; Cl@@ ou@@ ds Without Water &quot; , and &quot; Kon@@ x O@@ m Pax &quot; , as well as his first attempt at an autobiography , &quot; The World &apos;s Tra@@ ge@@ dy &quot; .
recognising the popularity of short horror stories , Crow@@ ley wrote his own , some of which were published , and he also published several articles in &quot; V@@ anity Fair &quot; , a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris .
he also wrote &quot; Li@@ ber 777 &quot; , a book of magical and Q@@ ab@@ alistic correspond@@ ences that borrowed from Ma@@ thers and Bennett .
into my loneliness comes - The sound of a flute in dim groves that haunt the utter@@ most hill@@ s.@@ Even from the brave river they reach to the edge of the wil@@ der@@ ness@@ .And I behold Pan .
in November 1907 , Crow@@ ley and Jones decided to found an occult order to act as a successor to the Her@@ metic Order of the Golden Dawn , being aided in doing so by Fuller .
the result was the A ∴ A ∴ .
the group &apos;s headquarters and temple were situated at 124 Victoria Street in central London , and their rites borrowed much from those of the Golden Dawn , but with an added Thel@@ emic basis .
its earliest members included solicitor Richard Noel Warren , artist Austin Osman Spar@@ e , Hor@@ ace Sher@@ idan @-@ B@@ ick@@ ers , author George R@@ aff@@ al@@ ovich , Francis Henry Ever@@ ard Joseph Fe@@ il@@ ding , engineer Herbert Edward In@@ man , Kenneth Ward , and Charles St@@ ans@@ feld Jones .
in March 19@@ 09 , Crow@@ ley began production of a biannual periodical titled &quot; The Equ@@ in@@ ox &quot; .
he billed this periodical , which was to become the &quot; Official Organ &quot; of the A ∴ A ∴ , as &quot; The Review of Scientific Il@@ lumin@@ ism . &quot; Crow@@ ley had become increasingly frustrated with Rose &apos;s alcoholism , and in November 19@@ 09 he divorced her on the grounds of his own adultery .
Lola was entrusted to Rose &apos;s care ; the couple remained friends and Rose continued to live at B@@ oles@@ kine .
her alcoholism worsened , and as a result she was institution@@ alised in September 1911 .
</p>
<p>
in November 19@@ 09 , Crow@@ ley and Neub@@ urg travelled to Algeria , touring the desert from El Ar@@ ba to A@@ um@@ ale , B@@ ou Sa@@ â@@ da , and then D@@ ā &apos;@@ leh Add@@ in , with Crow@@ ley re@@ citing the Qur@@ an on a daily basis .
during the trip he invoked the thirty a@@ ethy@@ rs of E@@ no@@ ch@@ ian magic , with Neub@@ urg recording the results , later published in &quot; The Equ@@ in@@ ox &quot; as &quot; The Vision and the Voice &quot; .
following a moun@@ ta@@ int@@ op sex magic ritual , Crow@@ ley also performed an invocation to the demon Chor@@ on@@ zon involving blood sacrifice , considering the results to be a watershed in his magical career .
returning to London in January 1910 , Crow@@ ley found that Ma@@ thers was suing him for publishing Golden Dawn secrets in &quot; The Equ@@ in@@ ox &quot; ; the court found in favour of Crow@@ ley .
the case was widely reported in the press , with Crow@@ ley gaining wider fame .
Crow@@ ley enjoyed this , and played up to the sens@@ ation@@ alist stereotype of being a Sat@@ anist and advocate of human sacrifice , despite being neither .
the publicity attracted new members to the A ∴ A ∴ , among them Frank Bennett , James Bay@@ ley , Herbert Close , and James Win@@ dra@@ m .
the Australian violinist Le@@ ila W@@ ad@@ dell soon became Crow@@ ley &apos;s lover .
deciding to expand his teachings to a wider audience , Crow@@ ley developed the R@@ ites of Artem@@ is , a public performance of magic and symbolism featuring A ∴ A ∴ members person@@ ifying various de@@ ities .
it was first performed at the A ∴ A ∴ headquarters , with attendees given a fruit punch containing pe@@ y@@ ote to enhance their experience .
various members of the press attended , and reported largely positively on it .
in October and November 1910 , Crow@@ ley decided to stage something similar , the R@@ ites of Ele@@ u@@ sis , at C@@ ax@@ ton Hall , Westminster ; this time press reviews were mixed .
Crow@@ ley came under particular criticism from West de W@@ end F@@ enton , editor of &quot; The Looking Glass &quot; newspaper , who called him &quot; one of the most blasph@@ em@@ ous and cold @-@ blooded vill@@ ains of modern times . &quot; F@@ enton &apos;s articles suggested that Crow@@ ley and Jones were involved in homosexual activity ;
Crow@@ ley did not mind , but Jones unsuccessfully sued for libel .
Fuller broke off his friendship and involvement with Crow@@ ley over the scandal , and Crow@@ ley and Neub@@ urg returned to Algeria for further magical workings . &quot;
the Equ@@ in@@ ox &quot; continued publishing , and various books of literature and poetry were also published under its imprint , like Crow@@ ley &apos;s &quot; Am@@ ber@@ gr@@ is &quot; , &quot; The W@@ ing@@ ed Be@@ et@@ le &quot; , and &quot; The Sc@@ ented Garden &quot; , as well as Neub@@ urg &apos;s &quot; The Tri@@ um@@ ph of Pan &quot; and Eth@@ el Archer &apos;s &quot; The Wh@@ ir@@ l@@ pool &quot; .
in 1911 , Crow@@ ley and W@@ ad@@ dell holid@@ ayed in Mon@@ ti@@ gny @-@ sur @-@ Lo@@ ing , where he wrote pro@@ lif@@ ically , producing poems , short stories , plays , and 19 works on magic and mys@@ ticism , including the two final Holy Books of Thel@@ ema .
in Paris , he met Mary D@@ esti , who became his next &quot; Scar@@ let Woman , &quot; with the two undertaking magical workings in St. Mor@@ itz ;
Crow@@ ley believed that one of the Secret Chiefs , A@@ b @-@ ul @-@ D@@ iz , was speaking through her .
based on D@@ esti &apos;s statements when in trance , Crow@@ ley wrote the two @-@ volume &quot; Book 4 &quot; and at the time developed the spelling &quot; mag@@ ick &quot; in reference to the par@@ an@@ orm@@ al phenomenon as a means of distinguishing it from the stage magic of illu@@ sion@@ ists .
</p>
<p>
in early 1912 , Crow@@ ley published &quot; The Book of L@@ ies &quot; , a work of mys@@ ticism that bi@@ ographer Lawrence Su@@ tin described as &quot; his greatest success in merging his talents as poet , scholar , and mag@@ us . &quot; the German oc@@ cul@@ tist Theodor Re@@ uss later accused him of publishing some of the secrets of his own occult order , the Or@@ do Tem@@ pl@@ i Ori@@ entis , within &quot; The Book &quot; .
Crow@@ ley convinced Re@@ uss that the similarities were co@@ incidental , and the two became friends .
Re@@ uss appointed Crow@@ ley as head of the O.@@ T.@@ O &apos;s British branch , the My@@ ster@@ ia M@@ ys@@ tica Maxim@@ a , and at a ceremony in Berlin Crow@@ ley adopted the magical name of Bap@@ hom@@ et and was proclaimed &quot; X ° Supreme Rex and Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland , I@@ ona , and all the Britons . &quot; with Re@@ uss &apos; permission , Crow@@ ley set about advertising the M@@ MM and re @-@ writing many O.@@ T.@@ O. rituals , which were then based largely on Fre@@ em@@ as@@ onry ; his incorporation of Thel@@ emite elements proved controversial in the group .
fascinated by the O.@@ T.@@ O &apos;s emphasis on sex magic , Crow@@ ley devised a magical working based on anal sex and incorporated it into the syllabus for those O.@@ T.@@ O. members who had been initiated into the eleventh degree .
in March 19@@ 13 Crow@@ ley acted as producer for &quot; The R@@ agged Rag@@ time Girls &quot; , a group of female viol@@ inists led by W@@ ad@@ dell , as they performed at London &apos;s Old Ti@@ vol@@ i theatre .
they subsequently performed in Moscow for six weeks , where Crow@@ ley had a sad@@ om@@ as@@ och@@ istic relationship with the Hungarian Ann@@ y R@@ ing@@ ler .
in Moscow , Crow@@ ley continued to write plays and poetry , including &quot; Hy@@ m@@ n to Pan , &quot; and the G@@ nostic Mass , a Thel@@ emic ritual that became a key part of O.@@ T.@@ O. lit@@ ur@@ gy .
Chur@@ ton suggested that Crow@@ ley had travelled to Moscow on the orders of British intelligence to spy on revolutionary elements in the city .
in January 1914 Crow@@ ley and Neub@@ urg settled into an apartment in Paris , where the former was involved in the controversy surrounding Jacob Ep@@ stein &apos;s new monument to Oscar Wil@@ de .
together Crow@@ ley and Neub@@ urg performed the six @-@ week &quot; Paris Working , &quot; a period of intense ritual involving strong drug use in which they invoked the gods Mercury and Jupiter .
as part of the ritual , the couple performed acts of sex magic together , at times being joined by journalist Walter D@@ uran@@ ty .
inspired by the results of the Working , Crow@@ ley wrote &quot; Li@@ ber Ag@@ ap@@ é &quot; , a treatise on sex magic .
following the Paris Working , Neub@@ urg began to distance himself from Crow@@ ley , resulting in an argument in which Crow@@ ley cursed him .
</p>
<p>
by 1914 Crow@@ ley was living a hand @-@ to @-@ mouth existence , relying largely on donations from A ∴ A ∴ members and dues payments made to O.@@ T.@@ O. In May he transferred ownership of B@@ oles@@ kine House to the M@@ MM for financial reasons , and in July he went mountain@@ eering in the Swiss Alps .
during this time the First World War broke out .
after recuper@@ ating from a bout of ph@@ lebi@@ tis , Crow@@ ley set sail for the United States aboard the R@@ MS &quot; Lus@@ it@@ ania &quot; in October 1914 .
arriving in New York City , he moved into a hotel and began earning money writing for the American edition of &quot; V@@ anity Fair &quot; and undertaking freelance work for the famed astro@@ lo@@ ger Ev@@ ang@@ eline Adams .
in the city , he continued experimenting with sex magic , through the use of mastur@@ bation , female prostitutes , and male clients of a Turkish bath@@ house ; all of these encounters were documented in his diaries .
prof@@ essing to be of Irish ancestry and a supporter of Irish independence from Great Britain , Crow@@ ley began to espouse support for Germany in their war against Britain .
he became involved in New York &apos;s pro @-@ German movement , and in January 1915 German spy George Syl@@ v@@ ester Vi@@ erec@@ k employed him as a writer for his propag@@ an@@ dist paper , &quot; The Fa@@ therland &quot; , which was dedicated to keeping the US neutral in the conflict .
in later years , detractors denounced Crow@@ ley as a traitor to Britain for this action .
in reality , Crow@@ ley was a double agent , working for the British intelligence services to infiltrate and undermine Germany &apos;s operation in New York .
many of his articles in &quot; The Fa@@ therland &quot; were hyper@@ bolic , for instance comparing Wilhelm II to Jesus Christ ; in July 1915 he orchestrated a publicity stunt - reported on by &quot; The New York Times &quot; - in which he declared independence for Ireland in front of the Statue of Liberty ; the real intention was to make the German lobby appear ridiculous in the eyes of the American public .
it has been argued that he encouraged the German Navy to destroy the &quot; Lus@@ it@@ ania &quot; , informing them that it would ensure the US stayed out of the war , while in reality hoping that it would bring the US into the war on Britain &apos;s side .
Crow@@ ley entered into a relationship with Jeanne Robert Foster , with whom he toured the West Coast .
in Vancouver , headquarters of the North American O.@@ T.@@ O. , he met with Charles St@@ ans@@ feld Jones and Wil@@ fred Talbot Smith to discuss the propagation of Thel@@ ema on the continent .
in Detroit he experimented with Pe@@ y@@ ote at Par@@ ke @-@ Davis , then visited Seattle , San Francisco , Santa Cruz , Los Angeles , San Diego , Ti@@ juana , and the Grand Canyon , before returning to New York .
there he be@@ fri@@ ended An@@ anda Coomaraswamy and his wife Alice Richardson ;
Crow@@ ley and Richardson performed sex magic in April 1916 , following which she became pregnant and then mis@@ carried .
later that year he took a &quot; magical retirement &quot; to a cabin by Lake Pas@@ qu@@ an@@ ey owned by Ev@@ ang@@ eline Adams .
there , he made heavy use of drugs and undertook a ritual after which he proclaimed himself &quot; Master Ther@@ ion . &quot; he also wrote several short stories based on J.@@ G. Fra@@ zer &apos;s &quot; The Golden B@@ ough &quot; and a work of literary criticism , &quot; The Gospel According to Bernard Shaw &quot; .
in December he moved to New Orleans , his favourite US city , before spending February 1917 with evangelical Christian relatives in Tit@@ us@@ ville , Florida .
returning to New York City , he moved in with artist and A ∴ A ∴ member Leon Eng@@ ers Kennedy in May , learning of his mother &apos;s death .
after the collapse of &quot; The Fa@@ therland &quot; , Crow@@ ley continued his association with Vi@@ erec@@ k , who appointed him contributing editor of arts journal &quot; The International &quot; .
Crow@@ ley used it to promote Thel@@ ema , but it soon ceased publication .
he then moved to the studio apartment of Rod@@ die Minor , who became his partner and Scar@@ let Woman .
through their rituals , which Crow@@ ley called &quot; The Amal@@ an@@ tra@@ h Work@@ ings , &quot; he believed that they were contacted by a pre@@ ter@@ natural entity named Lam .
the relationship soon ended .
in 1918 , Crow@@ ley went on a magical retreat in the wilderness of Es@@ op@@ us Island on the Hudson River .
here , he began a translation of the &quot; Tao Te Ching &quot; , painted Thel@@ emic slogans on the riverside cliffs , and - he later claimed - experienced past life memories of being Ge Xuan , Pope Alexander VI , Al@@ ess@@ andro C@@ ag@@ li@@ o@@ stro , and E@@ lip@@ has Levi .
back in New York City , he moved to Greenwich Village , where he took Le@@ ah Hir@@ si@@ g as his lover and next Scar@@ let Woman .
he took up painting as a hobby , exhibiting his work at the Greenwich Village Liberal Club and attracting the attention of the &quot; New York Evening World &quot; .
with the financial assistance of sympathetic Fre@@ em@@ as@@ ons , Crow@@ ley revived &quot; The Equ@@ in@@ ox &quot; with the first issue of volume III , known as &quot; The Blue Equ@@ in@@ ox &quot; .
he spent mid @-@ 1919 on a climbing holiday in Monta@@ uk before returning to London in December .
</p>
<p>
now destitute and back in London , Crow@@ ley came under attack from the tabloid &quot; John Bull &quot; , which labelled him tra@@ it@@ orous &quot; scum &quot; for his work with the German war effort ; several friends aware of his intelligence work urged him to sue , but he decided not to .
when he was suffering from asthma , a doctor prescribed him heroin , to which he soon became addicted .
in January 1920 , he moved to Paris , renting a house in Fon@@ tain@@ e@@ ble@@ au with Le@@ ah Hir@@ si@@ g ; they were soon joined in a &quot; mé@@ n@@ age à tro@@ is &quot; by Nin@@ ette S@@ hum@@ way , and also by Le@@ ah &apos;s newborn daughter Anne &quot; P@@ ou@@ p@@ ée &quot; Le@@ ah .
Crow@@ ley had ideas of forming a community of Thel@@ em@@ ites , which he called the Abbey of Thel@@ ema after the Ab@@ bay@@ e de Th@@ él@@ è@@ me in François Rab@@ el@@ ais &apos; satire &quot; Gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ a and Pan@@ tag@@ ru@@ el &quot; .
after consulting the &quot; I Ching &quot; , he chose C@@ ef@@ al@@ ù as a location , and after arriving there , began renting the old Villa Santa Barbara as his Abbey on 2 April .
moving to the commune with Hir@@ si@@ g , S@@ hum@@ way , and their children Han@@ si , Howard , and P@@ ou@@ p@@ ée , Crow@@ ley described the scenario as &quot; perfectly happy ... my idea of heaven . &quot; they wore robes , and performed rituals to the sun god Ra at set times during the day , also occasionally performing the G@@ nostic Mass ; the rest of the day they were left to follow their own interests .
undertaking widespread correspond@@ ences , Crow@@ ley continued to paint , wrote a commentary on &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; , and revised the third part of &quot; Book 4 &quot; .
he offered a liber@@ tine education for the children , allowing them to play all day and witness acts of sex magic .
he occasionally travelled to Palermo to visit rent boys and buy supplies , including drugs ; his heroin addiction came to dominate his life , and cocaine began to erode his nasal cavity .
there was no cleaning ro@@ ta , and wild dogs and cats wandered throughout the building , which soon became unsanitary .
P@@ ou@@ p@@ ée died in October 1920 , and Nin@@ ette gave birth to a daughter , A@@ star@@ te L@@ ulu Pan@@ the@@ a , soon afterwards .
new followers continued to arrive at the Abbey to be taught by Crow@@ ley .
among them was film star Jane Wolfe , who arrived in July 1920 , where she was initiated into the A ∴ A ∴ and became Crow@@ ley &apos;s secretary .
another was Cec@@ il Frederick Russell , who often argued with Crow@@ ley , dis@@ liking the same @-@ sex sexual magic that he was required to perform , and left after a year .
more conducive was the Australian Thel@@ emite Frank Bennett , who also spent several months at the Abbey .
in February 1922 , Crow@@ ley returned to Paris for a retreat in an unsuccessful attempt to kick his heroin addiction .
he then went to London in search of money , where he published articles in &quot; The English Review &quot; critic@@ ising the Dangerous Drugs Act 1920 and wrote a novel , &quot; Di@@ ary of a Drug Fi@@ end &quot; , completed in July .
on publication , it received mixed reviews ; he was lam@@ b@@ asted by the &quot; Sunday Express &quot; , which called for its burning and used its influence to prevent further re@@ prints .
subsequently , a young Thel@@ emite named Raoul Lov@@ eday moved to the Abbey with his wife Betty May ; while Lov@@ eday was devoted to Crow@@ ley , May de@@ tested him and life at the commune .
she later said that Lov@@ eday was made to drink the blood of a sacrificed cat , and that they were required to cut themselves with raz@@ ors every time they used the pronoun &quot; I. &quot; Lov@@ eday drank from a local polluted stream , soon developing a liver infection resulting in his death in February 1923 .
returning to London , May told her story to the press . &quot;
John Bull &quot; proclaimed Crow@@ ley &quot; the wic@@ ke@@ dest man in the world &quot; and &quot; a man we &apos;d like to hang , &quot; and although Crow@@ ley deemed many of their accusations against him to be slan@@ der@@ ous , he was unable to afford the legal fees to sue them .
as a result , &quot; John Bull &quot; continued its attack , with its stories being repeated in newspapers throughout Europe and in North America .
the Fasc@@ ist government of Ben@@ ito Mus@@ sol@@ ini learned of Crow@@ ley &apos;s activities and in April 1923 he was given a deportation notice forcing him to leave Italy ; without him , the Abbey closed .

Crow@@ ley and Hir@@ si@@ g went to Tunis , where , dogged by continuing poor health , he unsuccessfully tried again to give up heroin , and began writing what he termed his &quot; auto@@ h@@ agi@@ ography , &quot; &quot; The Conf@@ essions of Ale@@ ister Crow@@ ley &quot; .
they were joined in Tunis by the Thel@@ emite Norman Mud@@ d , who became Crow@@ ley &apos;s public relations consultant .
employing a local boy , Mohammad ben Bra@@ him , as his servant , Crow@@ ley went with him on a retreat to N@@ ef@@ ta , where they performed sex magic together .
in January 1924 , Crow@@ ley travelled to Nice , France , where he met with Frank Harris , underwent a series of nasal operations , and visited the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man and had a positive opinion of its founder , George Gur@@ d@@ ji@@ eff .
destitute , he took on a wealthy student , Alexander Z@@ u Z@@ olar , before taking on another American follower , Dorothy Ol@@ sen .
Crow@@ ley took Ol@@ sen back to Tunisia for a magical retreat in N@@ ef@@ ta , where he also wrote &quot; To Man &quot; , a declaration of his own status as a prophet entrusted with bringing Thel@@ ema to humanity .
after spending the winter in Paris , in early 1925 Crow@@ ley and Ol@@ sen returned to Tunis , where he wrote &quot; The Heart of the Master &quot; as an account of a vision he experienced in a trance .
in March Ol@@ sen became pregnant , and Hir@@ si@@ g was called to take care of her ; she mis@@ carried , following which Crow@@ ley took Ol@@ sen back to France .
Hir@@ si@@ g later distan@@ ced herself from Crow@@ ley , who then denounced her .
according to Crow@@ ley , Re@@ uss had named him head of the O.@@ T.@@ O. upon his death , but this was challenged by a leader of the German O.@@ T.@@ O. , Hein@@ rich Tr@@ än@@ ker .
Tr@@ än@@ ker called the Ho@@ hen@@ le@@ uben Conference in Thur@@ ing@@ ia , Germany , which Crow@@ ley attended .
there , prominent members like Karl Ger@@ mer and Martha K@@ ü@@ n@@ tz@@ el championed Crow@@ ley &apos;s leadership , but other key figures like Al@@ bin Gra@@ u , O@@ sk@@ ar Hop@@ fer , and Henri Bir@@ ven backed Tr@@ än@@ ker by opposing it , resulting in a split in the O.@@ T.@@ O. Moving to Paris , where he broke with Ol@@ sen in 1926 , Crow@@ ley went through a large number of lovers over the following years , with whom he experimented in sex magic .
throughout , he was dogged by poor health , largely caused by his heroin and cocaine addictions .
in 1928 , Crow@@ ley was introduced to young Englishman Israel Reg@@ ardi@@ e , who embraced Thel@@ ema and became Crow@@ ley &apos;s secretary for the next three years .
that year , Crow@@ ley also met Gerald Yor@@ ke , who began organising Crow@@ ley &apos;s finances but never became a Thel@@ emite .
he also be@@ fri@@ ended Thomas Dri@@ berg ; Dri@@ berg did not accept Thel@@ ema either .
it was here that Crow@@ ley also published one of his most significant works , &quot; Mag@@ ick in Theory and Practice &quot; , which received little attention at the time .
in December 1928 Crow@@ ley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez .
Crow@@ ley was deported from France by the authorities , who disliked his reputation and feared that he was a German agent .
so that she could join him in Britain , Crow@@ ley married Sanchez in August 1929 .
now based in London , Man@@ dra@@ ke Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six @-@ volume set , also publishing his novel &quot; Mo@@ on@@ child &quot; and book of short stories &quot; The Str@@ at@@ ag@@ em &quot; .
Man@@ dra@@ ke went into liquidation in November 1930 , before the entirety of Crow@@ ley &apos;s &quot; Conf@@ essions &quot; could be published .
Man@@ dra@@ ke &apos;s owner P.@@ R. Steph@@ enson meanwhile wrote &quot; The Leg@@ end of Ale@@ ister Crow@@ ley &quot; , an analysis of the media coverage surrounding him .

in April 1930 , Crow@@ ley moved to Berlin , where he took Hann@@ i J@@ aeg@@ ar as his magical partner ; the relationship was troubled .
in September he went to Lisbon in Portugal to meet the poet Fernando P@@ ess@@ oa .
there , he decided to fake his own death , doing so with P@@ ess@@ oa &apos;s help at the Boc@@ a do In@@ fer@@ no rock formation .
he then returned to Berlin , where he reappeared three weeks later at the opening of his art exhibition at the Gallery Ne@@ um@@ ann @-@ Ni@@ er@@ endor@@ f .
Crow@@ ley &apos;s paintings fitted with the fashion for German Ex@@ pres@@ sionism ; few of them sold , but the press reports were largely favourable .
in August 1931 , he took Bertha Bus@@ ch as his new lover ; they had a violent relationship , and often physically assaulted one another .
he continued to have affairs with both men and women while in the city , and met with famous people like Al@@ d@@ ous Hu@@ x@@ ley and Alfred Ad@@ ler .
after be@@ fri@@ ending him , in January 1932 he took the communist Gerald Hamilton as a lod@@ ger , through whom he was introduced to many figures within the Berlin far left ; it is possible that he was operating as a spy for British intelligence at this time , monitoring the communist movement .
I have been over forty years engaged in the administration of the law in one capacity or another .
I thought that I knew of every conceivable form of wickedness .
I thought that everything which was vicious and bad had been produced at one time or another before me .
I have learnt in this case that we can always learn something more if we live long enough .
I have never heard such dreadful , horrible , blasph@@ em@@ ous and abominable stuff as that which has been produced by the man who describes himself to you as the greatest living poet .
Crow@@ ley left Bus@@ ch and returned to London , where he took Pearl Brook@@ smith as his new Scar@@ let Woman .
undergoing further nasal surgery , it was here in 1932 that he was invited to be guest of honour at Fo@@ yles &apos; Literary Lun@@ cheon , also being invited by Harry Price to speak at the National Laboratory of Psych@@ ical Research .
in need of money , he launched a series of court cases against people whom he believed had li@@ bel@@ led him , some of which proved successful .
he gained much publicity for his lawsuit against Constable and Co for publishing Nina Ham@@ nett &apos;s &quot; Lau@@ gh@@ ing Tor@@ so &quot; - a book he thought li@@ bel@@ led him - but lost the case .
the court case added to Crow@@ ley &apos;s financial problems , and in February 1935 he was declared bankrupt .
during the hearing , it was revealed that Crow@@ ley had been spending three times his income for several years .
Crow@@ ley developed a friendship with De@@ id@@ re Patricia Do@@ herty ; she offered to bear his child , who was born in May 1937 .
named Rand@@ all G@@ air , Crow@@ ley nicknamed him Ale@@ ister At@@ at@@ ürk .
Crow@@ ley continued to soci@@ alise with friends , holding curry parties in which he cooked particularly spicy food for them .
in 1936 , he published his first book in six years , &quot; The Equ@@ in@@ ox of the Gods &quot; , which contained a facsimile of &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; and was considered to be volume III , number 3 , of &quot; The Equ@@ in@@ ox &quot; periodical .
the work sold well , resulting in a second print run .
in 1937 he gave a series of public lectures on yoga in So@@ ho .
Crow@@ ley was intrigued by the rise of Nazism in Germany , and influenced by his friend Martha K@@ ü@@ n@@ tz@@ el believed that Ad@@ olf Hitler might convert to Thel@@ ema ; when the Nazis abolished the German O.@@ T.@@ O. and imprisoned Ger@@ mer , who fled to the US , Crow@@ ley then lam@@ b@@ asted Hitler as a black magician .
</p>
<p>
when the Second World War broke out , Crow@@ ley wrote to the Naval Intelligence Division offering his services , but they declined .
he associated with a variety of figures in Britain &apos;s intelligence community at the time , including Dennis Whe@@ at@@ ley , Ro@@ ald Dah@@ l , Ian Fleming , and Maxwell Knight , and claimed to have been behind the &quot; V for Victory &quot; sign first used by the BBC ; this has never been proven .
in 1940 , his asthma worsened , and with his German @-@ produced medication unavailable , he returned to using heroin , once again becoming addicted .
as the B@@ lit@@ z hit London , Crow@@ ley relocated to Tor@@ qu@@ ay , where he was briefly hospit@@ alised with asthma , and entertained himself with visits to the local chess club .
tiring of Tor@@ qu@@ ay , he returned to London , where he was visited by American Thel@@ emite Gra@@ dy Mc@@ Mur@@ try , to whom Crow@@ ley awarded the title of &quot; Hy@@ men@@ a@@ eus Alpha . &quot; he stipulated that though Ger@@ mer would be his immediate successor , Mc@@ Mur@@ ty should succeed Ger@@ mer as head of the O.@@ T.@@ O. after the latter &apos;s death .
with O.@@ T.@@ O. initiate Lady Fri@@ eda Harris , Crow@@ ley developed plans to produce a tar@@ ot card set , designed by him and painted by Harris .
accompanying this was a book , published in a limited edition as &quot; The Book of T@@ ho@@ th &quot; by Chis@@ wick Press in 1944 .
to aid the war effort , he wrote a proclamation on the rights of humanity , &quot; Li@@ ber O@@ z &quot; , and a poem for the liberation of France , &quot; Le Gaul@@ oise &quot; .
Crow@@ ley &apos;s final publication during his lifetime was a book of poetry , &quot; Ol@@ la : an Anth@@ ology of Sixty Years of Song &quot; .
another of his projects , &quot; Ale@@ ister Ex@@ plains Everything &quot; , was pos@@ thum@@ ously published as &quot; Mag@@ ick Without T@@ ears &quot; .
in April 1944 Crow@@ ley briefly moved to Aston Clinton in Buck@@ ing@@ ham@@ shire , where he was visited by the poet Nancy Cun@@ ard , before relocating to Has@@ tings in Sus@@ sex , where he took up residence at the Nether@@ wood boarding house .
he took a young man named Kenneth Grant as his secretary , paying him in magical teaching rather than wages .
he was also introduced to John Sy@@ monds , whom he appointed to be his literary execu@@ tor ;
Sy@@ monds thought little of Crow@@ ley , later publishing negative bi@@ ographies of him .
corresponding with the illu@@ sionist Arnold Crow@@ ther , it was through him that Crow@@ ley was introduced to Gerald Gardner , the future founder of Gard@@ ner@@ ian W@@ ic@@ ca .
they became friends , with Crow@@ ley author@@ ising Gardner to revive Britain &apos;s ailing O.@@ T.@@ O. Another visitor was Eliza M@@ arian Butler , who interviewed Crow@@ ley for her book &quot; The My@@ th of the Mag@@ us &quot; .
other friends and family also spent time with him , among them Do@@ herty and Crow@@ ley &apos;s son Ale@@ ister At@@ at@@ ürk .
on 1 December 1947 , Crow@@ ley died at Nether@@ wood of chronic bronchitis aggravated by ple@@ ur@@ isy and myocardial degeneration , aged 72 .
his funeral was held at a Brighton cre@@ mat@@ or@@ ium on 5 December ; about a dozen people attended , and Louis Wil@@ kinson read excerpts from the G@@ nostic Mass , &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; , and &quot; Hy@@ m@@ n to Pan . &quot; the funeral generated press controversy , and was labelled a Black Mass by the tablo@@ ids .
Crow@@ ley &apos;s ashes were sent to Karl Ger@@ mer in the US , who buried them in his garden in Hamp@@ ton , New Jersey .

<p>
Crow@@ ley &apos;s belief system , Thel@@ ema , has been described by scholars as a religion , and more specifically as both a new religious movement , and as a &quot; mag@@ ico @-@ religious doctrine . &quot; it has also been characterised as a form of eso@@ ter@@ icism and modern P@@ ag@@ anism .
although holding &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; - which was composed in 1904 - as its central text , Thel@@ ema took shape as a complete system in the years after 1904 .
in his autobiography , Crow@@ ley claimed that his purpose in life had been to &quot; bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore pag@@ anism in a pur@@ er form , &quot; although what he meant by &quot; pag@@ anism &quot; was unclear .
Crow@@ ley &apos;s thought was not always cohesive , and was influenced by a variety of sources , ranging from eastern religious movements and practices like Hindu yoga and Buddhism , scientific natur@@ alism , and various currents within Western eso@@ ter@@ icism , among them ceremonial magic , al@@ chemy , astrology , Ros@@ ic@@ ru@@ ci@@ anism , Kab@@ bal@@ ah , and the Tar@@ ot .
he was steeped in the esoteric teachings he had learned from the Her@@ metic Order of the Golden Dawn , although pushed further with his own interpretations and strategies than the Golden Dawn had done .
Crow@@ ley incorporated concepts and terminology from South Asian religious traditions like yoga and Tan@@ tra into his Thel@@ emic system , believing that there was a fundamental underlying resemblance between Western and Eastern spiritual systems .
the historian Alex Owen noted that Crow@@ ley adhered to the &quot; modus operandi &quot; of the Dec@@ ad@@ ent movement throughout his life .
Crow@@ ley believed that the twentieth century marked humanity &apos;s entry to the A@@ eon of Hor@@ us , a new era in which humans would take increasing control of their destiny .
he believed that this A@@ eon follows on from the A@@ eon of O@@ si@@ ris , in which patern@@ alistic religions like Christianity , Islam , and Buddhism dominated the world , and that this in turn had followed the A@@ eon of I@@ sis , which had been mater@@ n@@ alistic and dominated by goddess worship .
he believed that Thel@@ ema was the proper religion of the A@@ eon of Hor@@ us , and also deemed himself to be the prophet of this new A@@ eon .
Thel@@ ema revolves around the idea that human beings each have their own True Will that they should discover and pursue , and that this exists in harmony with the Co@@ sm@@ ic Will that perv@@ ades the universe .
Crow@@ ley referred to this process of searching and discovery of one &apos;s True Will to be &quot; the Great Work &quot; or the attaining of the &quot; knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel . &quot; his favoured method of doing so was through the performance of the Abra@@ mel@@ in operation , a ceremonial magic ritual obtained from a 17th @-@ century gri@@ moire .
the moral code of &quot; Do What Thou Wil@@ t &quot; is believed by Thel@@ em@@ ites to be the religion &apos;s ethical law , although the historian of religion Marco P@@ asi noted that this was not anarch@@ istic or liber@@ tarian in structure , as Crow@@ ley saw individuals as part of a wider societal organism .
</p>
<p>
Crow@@ ley believed in the objective existence of magic , which he chose to spell &quot; Mag@@ ick , &quot; an older archaic spelling of the word .
he provided various different definitions of this term over his career .
in his book &quot; Mag@@ ick in Theory and Practice &quot; , Crow@@ ley defined Mag@@ ick as &quot; the Science and Art of causing change to occur in conformity with Will . &quot; he also told his disciple Karl Ger@@ mer that &quot; Mag@@ ick is getting into communication with individuals who exist on a higher plane than ours . mys@@ ticism is the raising of oneself to their level . &quot; Crow@@ ley saw Mag@@ ick as a third way between religion and science , giving &quot; The Equ@@ in@@ ox &quot; the subtitle of &quot; The Method of Science ; the Aim of Religion &quot; .
within that journal he expressed positive sentiments toward science and the scientific method , and urged mag@@ icians to keep detailed records of their magical experiments , &quot; The more scientific the record is , the better . &quot; his understanding of magic was also influenced by the work of the anthropologist James Fra@@ zer , in particular the view that magic was a precursor to science in a cultural evolutionary framework .
unlike Fra@@ zer , however , Crow@@ ley did not see magic as a survival from the past that required eradication , but rather he believed that magic had to be adapted to suit the new age of science .
in Crow@@ ley &apos;s alternative schema , old systems of &quot; magic &quot; had to decline so that science and magic could synthesize into &quot; mag@@ ick &quot; , which would simultaneously accept the existence of the supernatural and an experimental method .
Crow@@ ley deliberately adopted an exceptionally broad definition of mag@@ ick that included almost all forms of technology as mag@@ ick , adopting an instrument@@ alist interpretation of magic , science , and technology .
he outlined three forms of sex mag@@ ick - the auto@@ erotic , homosexual , and heterosexual - and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician &apos;s will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success .
for Crow@@ ley , sex was treated as a sac@@ ra@@ ment , with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eu@@ char@@ ist .
this was often manifested as the C@@ akes of Light , a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids .
the G@@ nostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thel@@ ema .
Crow@@ ley &apos;s theological beliefs were not clear .
the historian Ronald Hut@@ ton noted that some of Crow@@ ley &apos;s writings could be used to argue that he was an athe@@ ist , while some support the idea that he was a poly@@ the@@ ist , and others would bolster the idea that he was a mystical mono@@ the@@ ist .
on the basis of the teachings in &quot; The Book of the Law &quot; , Crow@@ ley described a pan@@ the@@ on of three de@@ ities taken from the ancient Egyptian pan@@ the@@ on : Nu@@ it , Had@@ it , and Ra @-@ Ho@@ or @-@ Khu@@ it .
in 1928 , he made the claim that all &quot; true &quot; de@@ ities were &quot; derived &quot; from this tr@@ inity .
Jason Joseph@@ son @-@ Storm has argued that Crow@@ ley built on 19th @-@ century attempts to link early Christianity to P@@ ag@@ anism , such as Fra@@ zer &apos;s &quot; Golden B@@ ough &quot; , to synthesize Christian theology and Ne@@ op@@ ag@@ anism while remaining critical of institutional and traditional Christianity .
both during his life and after it , Crow@@ ley has been widely described as a Sat@@ anist , usually by detractors .
Crow@@ ley stated he did not consider himself a Sat@@ anist , nor did he worship Satan , as he did not accept the Christian world view in which Satan was believed to exist .
he nevertheless used Sat@@ anic imagery , for instance by describing himself as &quot; the Be@@ ast 666 &quot; and referring to the Wh@@ ore of Babylon in his work , while in later life he sent &quot; Anti@@ christmas cards &quot; to his friends .
in his writings , Crow@@ ley occasionally identified Ai@@ w@@ ass as Satan and designated him as &quot; Our Lord God the Devil &quot; at one occasion .
the scholar of religion Gord@@ an D@@ jur@@ dj@@ evic stated that Crow@@ ley &quot; was emphatically not &quot; a Sat@@ anist , &quot; if for no other reason than simply because he did not identify himself as such . &quot; Crow@@ ley nevertheless expressed anti @-@ Christian sentiment , stating that he hated Christianity &quot; as Soci@@ alists hate soap , &quot; an animosity likely stemming from his experiences among the Plymouth Bre@@ thren .
he was also accused of advocating human sacrifice , largely because of a passage in &quot; Book 4 &quot; in which he stated that &quot; A male child of perfect innocence and high intelligence is the most satisfactory victim &quot; and added that he had sacrificed about 150 every year .
this was a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek reference to ejac@@ ulation , something not realised by his critics , thus reflecting their own &quot; ignorance and prejudice &quot; toward Crow@@ ley .
</p>
<p>
Crow@@ ley considered himself to be one of the outstanding figures of his time .
the historian Ronald Hut@@ ton stated that in Crow@@ ley &apos;s youth , he was &quot; a self @-@ indulgent and flam@@ boy@@ ant young man &quot; who &quot; set about a deliberate flouting and provocation of social and religious norms , &quot; while being shielded from an &quot; outraged public opinion &quot; by his inherited wealth .
Hut@@ ton also described Crow@@ ley as having both an &quot; un@@ appe@@ as@@ able desire &quot; to take control of any organisation that he belonged to , and &quot; a tendency to quarrel savag@@ ely &quot; with those who challenged him .
</p>
<p>
Crow@@ ley enjoyed being outrageous and flouting conventional morality , with John Sy@@ monds noting that he &quot; was in revolt against the moral and religious values of his time . &quot; Crow@@ ley &apos;s political thought was studied by academic Marco P@@ asi , who noted that for Crow@@ ley , socio @-@ political concerns were subordinate to metaphysical and spiritual ones .
he was neither on the political left nor right but perhaps best categor@@ ised as a &quot; conservative revolutionary &quot; despite not being affiliated with the German @-@ based conservative revolutionary movement .
P@@ asi described Crow@@ ley &apos;s affinity to the extreme ideologies of Nazism and Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism , which aimed to violently overturn society :
although he had contempt for most of the British aristocracy , he regarded himself as an arist@@ ocrat and styled himself as L@@ aird B@@ oles@@ kine , once describing his ideology as &quot; aristocratic communism . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Crow@@ ley was bisexual , and exhibited a sexual preference for women , with his homosexual relationships being fewer and clustered in the early part of his life .
in particular he had an attraction toward &quot; exotic women , &quot; and claimed to have fallen in love on multiple occasions ;
Kac@@ z@@ ynski stated that &quot; when he loved , he did so with his whole being , but the passion was typically short @-@ lived . &quot; even in later life , Crow@@ ley was able to attract young bo@@ hem@@ ian women to be his lovers , largely due to his charisma .
bi@@ ographer Lawrence Su@@ tin stated that &quot; blatant bigotry is a persistent minor element in Crow@@ ley &apos;s writings . &quot; Su@@ tin thought Crow@@ ley &quot; a spoiled sci@@ on of a wealthy Victorian family who embodied many of the worst John Bull racial and social prejudices of his upper @-@ class contemporaries , &quot; noting that he &quot; embodied the contradiction that wri@@ thed within many Western intellectuals of the time : deeply held racist viewpoints courtesy of society , coupled with a fascination with people of colour . &quot; Crow@@ ley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neub@@ urg using anti @-@ Semitic sl@@ urs and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group .
although he praised their &quot; sublime &quot; poetry and stated that they exhibited &quot; imagination , romance , loyalty , probity and humanity , &quot; he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit &quot; av@@ ar@@ ice , serv@@ ility , fal@@ seness , cunning and the rest . &quot; he was also known to praise various ethnic and cultural groups , for instance he thought that the Chinese people exhibited a &quot; spiritual superiority &quot; to the English , and praised Muslims for exhibiting &quot; man@@ liness , straight@@ forwar@@ dness , subtlety , and self @-@ respect . &quot; Crow@@ ley also exhibited a &quot; general mis@@ og@@ y@@ ny &quot; that Boo@@ th believed arose from his bad relationship with his mother .
Su@@ tin noted that Crow@@ ley &quot; largely accepted the notion , implicitly embodied in Victorian sex@@ ology , of women as secondary social beings in terms of intellect and sensibility . &quot; Crow@@ ley described women as &quot; moral inferi@@ ors &quot; who had to be treated with &quot; firmness , kindness and justice . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in 2002 , a BBC poll placed Crow@@ ley seventy @-@ third in a list of the 100 Great@@ est Britons .
Thel@@ ema continued to develop and spread following Crow@@ ley &apos;s death .
in 1969 , the O.@@ T.@@ O. was reactivated in California under the leadership of Gra@@ dy Louis Mc@@ Mur@@ try ; in 1985 its right to the title was unsuccessfully challenged in court by a rival group , the Society Or@@ do Tem@@ pl@@ i Ori@@ entis , led by Brazilian Thel@@ emite Marcelo Ramos Mot@@ ta .
another American Thel@@ emite is the film@@ maker Kenneth An@@ ger , who had been influenced by Crow@@ ley &apos;s writings from a young age .
in the United Kingdom , Kenneth Grant propagated a tradition known as Ty@@ ph@@ onian Thel@@ ema through his organisation , the Ty@@ ph@@ onian O.@@ T.@@ O. , later renamed the Ty@@ ph@@ onian Order .
also in Britain , an oc@@ cul@@ tist known as Am@@ ado Crow@@ ley claimed to be Crow@@ ley &apos;s son ; this has been refuted by academic investigation .
Am@@ ado argued that Thel@@ ema was a false religion created by Crow@@ ley to hide his true esoteric teachings , which Am@@ ado claimed to be propagating .
several Western esoteric traditions other than Thel@@ ema were also influenced by Crow@@ ley , with D@@ jur@@ dj@@ evic observing that &quot; Crow@@ ley &apos;s influence on twentieth @-@ century and contemporary eso@@ ter@@ icism has been enormous . &quot; Gerald Gardner , founder of Gard@@ ner@@ ian W@@ ic@@ ca , made use of much of Crow@@ ley &apos;s published material when composing the Gard@@ ner@@ ian ritual lit@@ ur@@ gy , and the Australian witch Ro@@ sal@@ een Norton was also heavily influenced by Crow@@ ley &apos;s ideas .
more widely , Crow@@ ley became &quot; a dominant figure &quot; in the modern P@@ agan community .
L. Ron Hub@@ bard , the American founder of Scient@@ ology , was involved in Thel@@ ema in the early 1940s , and it has been argued that Crow@@ ley &apos;s ideas influenced some of Hub@@ bard &apos;s work .
the scholars of religion As@@ b@@ jør@@ n Dy@@ rend@@ el , James R. Lewis , and Jes@@ per Petersen noted that despite the fact that Crow@@ ley was not a Sat@@ anist , he &quot; in many ways embodies the pre @-@ Sat@@ anist esoteric discourse on Satan and Sat@@ anism through his lifestyle and his philosophy , &quot; with his &quot; image and ought &quot; becoming an &quot; important influence &quot; on the later development of religious Sat@@ anism .
for instance , two prominent figures in religious Sat@@ anism , Anton La@@ V@@ ey and Michael Aqu@@ ino , were influenced by Crow@@ ley &apos;s work .
Crow@@ ley also had a wider influence in British popular culture .
after his time in C@@ ef@@ al@@ ù which had brought him to public attention in Britain , various &quot; literary Crow@@ leys &quot; appeared ; characters in fiction based upon him .
one of the earliest was the character of the poet Shelley Ara@@ bin in John Bu@@ chan &apos;s 1926 novel &quot; The D@@ ancing Floor &quot; .
in his novel &quot; The Devil R@@ ides Out &quot; , the writer Dennis Whe@@ at@@ ley used Crow@@ ley as a partial basis for the character of Dami@@ en Mor@@ cat@@ a , a port@@ ly bald def@@ rocked priest who engages in black magic .
the oc@@ cul@@ tist Di@@ on Fortune used Crow@@ ley as a basis for characters in her books &quot; The Secrets of Doctor T@@ aver@@ ner &quot; and &quot; The W@@ ing@@ ed Bull &quot; .
he was included as one of the figures on the cover art of The Beatles &apos; album &quot; S@@ g@@ t. Pep@@ per &apos;s Lon@@ ely Hear@@ ts Club Band &quot; , and his motto of &quot; Do What Thou Wil@@ t &quot; was inscribed on the vinyl of L@@ ed Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ in &apos;s album &quot; L@@ ed Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ in III &quot; .
led Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ in co @-@ founder Jimmy Page bought B@@ oles@@ kine in 1971 , and part of the band &apos;s film &quot; The Song Rem@@ ains the Same &quot; was filmed in the grounds .
he sold it in 1992 .
David Bo@@ wie made reference to Crow@@ ley in the lyrics of his song &quot; Quick@@ sand &quot; , while O@@ zzy Os@@ bourne and his ly@@ ric@@ ist Bob Da@@ is@@ ley wrote a song titled &quot; Mr. Crow@@ ley &quot; .
Crow@@ ley began to receive scholarly attention from academics in the late 1990s .

Alan Math@@ ison Tur@@ ing was an English mathematician , computer scientist , log@@ ician , cryp@@ t@@ analyst , philosopher and theoretical biologist .
Tur@@ ing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science , providing a form@@ alisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Tur@@ ing machine , which can be considered a model of a general @-@ purpose computer .
Tur@@ ing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence .
despite these accomplishments , he was never fully recognised in his home country during his lifetime , due to his homosexuality , which was then a crime in the UK .
during the Second World War , Tur@@ ing worked for the Government Code and Cy@@ pher School at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park , Britain &apos;s co@@ deb@@ re@@ aking centre that produced Ul@@ tra intelligence .
for a time he led Hu@@ t 8 , the section that was responsible for German naval cryp@@ t@@ analysis .
here , he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ci@@ ph@@ ers , including improvements to the pre @-@ war Polish bom@@ be method , an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the En@@ ig@@ ma machine .
Tur@@ ing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements , including the Battle of the Atlantic , and in so doing helped win the war .
counter@@ factual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ul@@ tra intelligence had on the length of the war , but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives .
after the war , Tur@@ ing worked at the National Physical Laboratory , where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine , which was one of the first designs for a stored @-@ program computer .
in 1948 , Tur@@ ing joined Max New@@ man &apos;s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester , where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology .
he wrote a paper on the chemical basis of mor@@ pho@@ genesis and predicted oscill@@ ating chemical reactions such as the Bel@@ ou@@ sov @-@ Zha@@ bo@@ tin@@ sky reaction , first observed in the 1960s .
Tur@@ ing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts ; the Lab@@ ou@@ ch@@ ere Amendment had mandated that &quot; gross in@@ decency &quot; was a criminal offence in the UK .
he accepted chemical ca@@ stration treatment , with DES , as an alternative to prison .
Tur@@ ing died in 1954 , 16 days before his 42nd birthday , from cyanide poisoning .
an inquest determined his death as a suicide , but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning .
in 2009 , following an Internet campaign , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for &quot; the appalling way he was treated . &quot; Queen Elizabeth II granted Tur@@ ing a pos@@ thum@@ ous pardon in 2013 .
the Alan Tur@@ ing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts .

Tur@@ ing was born in Ma@@ ida Vale , London , while his father , Julius Math@@ ison Tur@@ ing , was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service at Ch@@ at@@ rap@@ ur , then in the Mad@@ ras Presidency and presently in O@@ dis@@ ha state , in India .
Tur@@ ing &apos;s father was the son of a clergyman , the Rev. John Robert Tur@@ ing , from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a bar@@ onet .
Tur@@ ing &apos;s mother , Julius &apos; wife , was Eth@@ el Sara Tur@@ ing , daughter of Edward Wall@@ er St@@ oney , chief engineer of the Mad@@ ras Railways .
the St@@ one@@ ys were a Protestant Anglo @-@ Irish gen@@ try family from both County T@@ ip@@ per@@ ary and County Long@@ ford , while Eth@@ el herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare .
Julius &apos; work with the ICS brought the family to British India , where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army .
however , both Julius and Eth@@ el wanted their children to be brought up in Britain , so they moved to Ma@@ ida Vale , London , where Alan Tur@@ ing was born on 23 June 1912 , as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth , later the Col@@ onn@@ ade Hotel .
Tur@@ ing had an elder brother , John .
Tur@@ ing &apos;s father &apos;s civil service commission was still active and during Tur@@ ing &apos;s childhood years Tur@@ ing &apos;s parents travelled between Has@@ tings in England and India , leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple .
at Has@@ tings , Tur@@ ing stayed at B@@ ast@@ on Lo@@ dge , Upper Maz@@ e Hill , St Leon@@ ards @-@ on @-@ Sea , now marked with a blue plaque .
the plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012 , the centenary of Tur@@ ing &apos;s birth .
very early in life , Tur@@ ing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently .
his parents purchased a house in Guil@@ d@@ ford in 1927 , and Tur@@ ing lived there during school holidays .
the location is also marked with a blue plaque .
</p>
<p>
Tur@@ ing &apos;s parents enrolled him at St Michael &apos;s , a day school at 20 Charles Road , St Leon@@ ards @-@ on @-@ Sea , at the age of six .
the head@@ mistress recognised his talent early on , as did many of his subsequent teachers .
between January 1922 and 1926 , Tur@@ ing was educated at Haz@@ el@@ hur@@ st Preparatory School , an independent school in the village of Fr@@ ant in Sus@@ sex .
in 1926 , at the age of 13 , he went on to Sher@@ borne School , a boarding independent school in the market town of Sher@@ borne in Dor@@ set .
the first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain , but he was so determined to attend , that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sher@@ borne , stopping overnight at an inn .
Tur@@ ing &apos;s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sher@@ borne , whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics .
his headmaster wrote to his parents : &quot; I hope he will not fall between two sto@@ ols . if he is to stay at public school , he must aim at becoming &quot; educated &quot; . if he is to be solely a &quot; Scientific Specialist &quot; , he is wasting his time at a public school . &quot; despite this , Tur@@ ing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved , solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus .
in 1928 , aged 16 , Tur@@ ing encountered Albert Einstein &apos;s work ; not only did he grasp it , but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein &apos;s questioning of Newton &apos;s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit .
</p>
<p>
at Sher@@ borne , Tur@@ ing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Mor@@ com , who has been described as Tur@@ ing &apos;s &quot; first love . &quot; their relationship provided inspiration in Tur@@ ing &apos;s future endeavours , but it was cut short by Mor@@ com &apos;s death , in February 1930 , from complications of bovine tuberculosis , contracted after drinking infected cow &apos;s milk some years previously .
the event caused Tur@@ ing great sorrow .
he cop@@ ed with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Mor@@ com .
in a letter to Mor@@ com &apos;s mother Tur@@ ing said : I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and un@@ conceited .
I regarded my interest in my work , and in such things as astronomy as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me ...
I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive , because that is what he would like me to do .
some have speculated that Mor@@ com &apos;s death was the cause of Tur@@ ing &apos;s athe@@ ism and materialism .
apparently , at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit , independent of the body and surviving death .
in a later letter , also written to Mor@@ com &apos;s mother , Tur@@ ing said :
personally , I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body &#91; can &#93; hold on to a &apos; spirit &apos; , whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected .
when the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies , the &apos; mechanism &apos; of the body , holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later , perhaps immediately .
</p>
<p>
after Sher@@ borne , Tur@@ ing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King &apos;s College , Cambridge , where he was awarded first @-@ class honours in mathematics .
in 1935 , at the age of 22 , he was elected a fellow of King &apos;s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem .
unknown to the committee , the theorem had already been proven , in 1922 , by Jar@@ l Wal@@ dem@@ ar L@@ inde@@ berg .
a blue plaque at the college was unveiled on the centenary of his birth on 23 June 2012 and is now installed at the college &apos;s Keynes Building on King &apos;s Par@@ ade .
in 1936 , Tur@@ ing published his paper &quot; On Compu@@ table Numbers , with an Application to the En@@ t@@ sch@@ eid@@ ung@@ s@@ problem &quot; .
in this paper , Tur@@ ing reformulated Kurt Gö@@ del &apos;s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation , replacing Gö@@ del &apos;s universal arithmetic @-@ based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Tur@@ ing machines .
the &quot; En@@ t@@ sch@@ eid@@ ung@@ s@@ problem &quot; was originally posed by German mathematician David Hil@@ bert in 1928 .
Tur@@ ing proved that his &quot; universal computing machine &quot; would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were repres@@ en@@ table as an algorithm .
he went on to prove that there was no solution to the &quot; decision problem &quot; by first showing that the halting problem for Tur@@ ing machines is un@@ dec@@ idable :
it is not possible to decide algorith@@ m@@ ically whether a Tur@@ ing machine will ever halt .
although Tur@@ ing &apos;s proof was published shortly after Al@@ on@@ zo Church &apos;s equivalent proof using his lam@@ b@@ da calculus , Tur@@ ing &apos;s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church &apos;s .
it also included a notion of a &apos; Universal Machine &apos; , with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine .
according to the Church @-@ Tur@@ ing thesis , Tur@@ ing machines and the lam@@ b@@ da calculus are capable of computing anything that is compu@@ table .
John von Ne@@ um@@ ann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Tur@@ ing &apos;s paper .
to this day , Tur@@ ing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation .
from September 1936 to July 1938 , Tur@@ ing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University , in the second year as a Jane Eliza Proc@@ ter Visiting Fellow .
in addition to his purely mathematical work , he studied cryp@@ t@@ ology and also built three of four stages of an electro @-@ mechanical binary multiplier .
in June 1938 , he obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton ; his dissertation , &quot; Systems of Logic Based on Ordin@@ als &quot; , introduced the concept of ordin@@ al logic and the notion of relative computing , where Tur@@ ing machines are augmented with so @-@ called or@@ acles , allowing the study of problems that cannot be solved by Tur@@ ing machines .
John von Ne@@ um@@ ann wanted to hire him as his post@@ doctoral assistant , but he went back to England .
</p>
<p>
when Tur@@ ing returned to Cambridge , he attended lectures given in 1939 by Lud@@ wig W@@ itt@@ gen@@ stein about the foundations of mathematics .
the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim , including inter@@ jec@@ tions from Tur@@ ing and other students , from students &apos; notes .
Tur@@ ing and W@@ itt@@ gen@@ stein argued and disagreed , with Tur@@ ing defending form@@ alism and W@@ itt@@ gen@@ stein prop@@ ounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths , but rather inven@@ ts them .
</p>
<p>
during the Second World War , Tur@@ ing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ci@@ ph@@ ers at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park .
the historian and wartime co@@ deb@@ re@@ aker As@@ a Brig@@ gs has said , &quot; You needed exceptional talent , you needed genius at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley and Tur@@ ing &apos;s was that genius . &quot; from September 1938 , Tur@@ ing had been working part @-@ time with the GC &amp; CS , the British co@@ deb@@ re@@ aking organisation .
he concentrated on cryp@@ t@@ analysis of the En@@ ig@@ ma with Dil@@ ly Kno@@ x , a senior GC &amp; CS co@@ deb@@ re@@ aker .
soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Ci@@ pher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of En@@ ig@@ ma ro@@ tors and their method of decryp@@ ting En@@ ig@@ ma code messages , Tur@@ ing and Kno@@ x started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem .
the Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change , which they did in May 1940 .
Tur@@ ing &apos;s approach was more general , using crib @-@ based decryp@@ tion for which he produced the functional specification of the bom@@ be .
on 4 September 1939 , the day after the UK declared war on Germany , Tur@@ ing reported to B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park , the wartime station of GC &amp; CS .
specifying the bom@@ be was the first of five major cryp@@ t@@ analytical advances that Tur@@ ing made during the war .
the others were : deduc@@ ing the indicator procedure used by the German navy ; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bom@@ bes dubbed &quot; Ban@@ bur@@ is@@ mus &quot; ; developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lor@@ en@@ z S@@ Z 40 / 42 dubbed &quot; Tur@@ ing@@ ery &quot; and , towards the end of the war , the development of a portable secure voice scram@@ bler at Hans@@ l@@ ope Park that was co@@ den@@ amed &quot; Del@@ ilah &quot; .
by using statistical techniques to optim@@ ise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process , Tur@@ ing made an innovative contribution to the subject .
he wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches , titled &quot; The Applications of Prob@@ ability to C@@ ryp@@ to@@ graphy &quot; and &quot; Paper on Statistics of Re@@ petitions &quot; , which were of such value to GC &amp; CS and its successor G@@ CH@@ Q that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 , shortly before the centenary of his birth .
a G@@ CH@@ Q mathematician , &quot; who identified himself only as Richard , &quot; said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance , and their relevance to post @-@ war cryp@@ t@@ analysis : text = &#91; He &#93; said the fact that the contents had been restricted &quot; shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject . &quot; ...
the papers detailed using &quot; mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible . &quot; ...
Richard said that G@@ CH@@ Q had now &quot; squeezed the juice &quot; out of the two papers and was &quot; happy for them to be released into the public domain . &quot; Tur@@ ing had a reputation for eccentricity at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park .
he was known to his colleagues as &quot; Prof &quot; and his treatise on En@@ ig@@ ma was known as the &quot; Prof &apos;s Book . &quot; according to historian Ronald Lew@@ in , Jack Good , a cryp@@ t@@ analyst who worked with Tur@@ ing , said of his colleague :
in the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever , and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off .
his bicycle had a fault : the chain would come off at regular intervals .
instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the ped@@ als went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand .
another of his eccentr@@ icities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen .
while working at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley , Tur@@ ing , who was a talented long @-@ distance runner , occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for meetings , and he was capable of world @-@ class marathon standards .
Tur@@ ing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team but he was hampered by an injury .
his try@@ out time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver med@@ all@@ ist Thomas Richards &apos; Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes .
he was Wal@@ ton Athle@@ tic Club &apos;s best runner , a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone .
in 1946 , Tur@@ ing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by King George VI for his wartime services , but his work remained secret for many years .
</p>
<p>
within weeks of arriving at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park , Tur@@ ing had specified an electromechanical machine called the bom@@ be , which could break En@@ ig@@ ma more effectively than the Polish &quot; bom@@ ba k@@ ryp@@ t@@ olog@@ ic@@ z@@ na &quot; , from which its name was derived .
the bom@@ be , with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Wel@@ chman , became one of the primary tools , and the major automated one , used to attack En@@ ig@@ ma @-@ enci@@ ph@@ ered messages .
the bom@@ be searched for possible correct settings used for an En@@ ig@@ ma message using a suitable &quot; crib &quot; : a fragment of probable plain@@ text .
for each possible setting of the ro@@ tors , the bom@@ be performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib , implemented electrom@@ echan@@ ically .
the bom@@ be detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting , moving on to the next .
most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded , leaving only a few to be investigated in detail .
a contradiction would occur when an enci@@ ph@@ ered letter would be turned back into the same plain@@ text letter , which was impossible with the En@@ ig@@ ma .
the first bom@@ be was installed on 18 March 1940 .
by late 1941 , Tur@@ ing and his fellow cryp@@ t@@ analysts Gordon Wel@@ chman , Hugh Alexander and Stuart Mil@@ ner @-@ Barry were frustrated .
building on the work of the Poles , they had set up a good working system for decryp@@ ting En@@ ig@@ ma signals , but their limited staff and bom@@ bes meant they could not translate all the signals .
in the summer , they had considerable success , and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month ; however , they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments .
they had tried to get more people and fund more bom@@ bes through the proper channels , but had failed .
on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties , with Tur@@ ing as the first named .
they emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces .
as Andrew Hod@@ ges , bi@@ ographer of Tur@@ ing , later wrote , &quot; This letter had an electric effect . &quot; Churchill wrote a memo to General Is@@ may , which read :
&quot; action THIS DAY . make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done . &quot; on 18 November , the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken .
the crypto@@ graph@@ ers at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park did not know of the Prime Minister &apos;s response , but as Mil@@ ner @-@ Barry recalled , &quot; All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth . &quot; more than two hundred bom@@ bes were in operation by the end of the war .
</p>
<p>
Tur@@ ing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval En@@ ig@@ ma &quot; because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . &quot; in December 1939 , Tur@@ ing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system , which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services .
that same night , he also conceived of the idea of &quot; Ban@@ bur@@ is@@ mus &quot; , a sequential statistical technique to assist in breaking the naval En@@ ig@@ ma , &quot; though I was not sure that it would work in practice , and was not , in fact , sure until some days had actually broken . &quot; for this , he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the &quot; ban &quot; . &quot;
Ban@@ bur@@ is@@ mus &quot; could rule out certain sequences of the En@@ ig@@ ma ro@@ tors , substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bom@@ bes .
Tur@@ ing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryp@@ t@@ analysts on the naval En@@ ig@@ ma and bom@@ be construction in Washington ; he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton , Ohio .
Tur@@ ing &apos;s reaction to the American bom@@ be design was far from enthusiastic : text = The American Bom@@ be programme was to produce 336 Bom@@ bes , one for each wheel order .
I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bom@@ be hut routine implied by this programme , but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way .
their test can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices .
nobody seems to be told about rods or off@@ iz@@ iers or ban@@ bur@@ is@@ mus unless they are really going to do something about it .
during this trip , he also assisted at Bell Lab@@ s with the development of secure speech devices .
he returned to B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park in March 1943 .
during his absence , Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hu@@ t 8 , although Alexander had been &quot; de facto &quot; head for some time .
Tur@@ ing became a general consultant for cryp@@ t@@ analysis at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park .
Alexander wrote of Tur@@ ing &apos;s contribution : there should be no question in anyone &apos;s mind that Tur@@ ing &apos;s work was the biggest factor in Hu@@ t 8 &apos;s success .
in the early days , he was the only crypto@@ grapher who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hu@@ t , but he also shared with Wel@@ chman and K@@ een the chief credit for the invention of the bom@@ be .
it is always difficult to say that anyone is &apos; absolutely indispensable &apos; , but if anyone was indispensable to Hu@@ t 8 , it was Tur@@ ing .
the pioneer &apos;s work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hu@@ t 8 felt that the magnitude of Tur@@ ing &apos;s contribution was never fully realised by the outside world .
</p>
<p>
in July 1942 , Tur@@ ing devised a technique termed &quot; Tur@@ ing@@ ery &quot; for use against the Lor@@ en@@ z cipher messages produced by the Germans &apos; new &quot; Ge@@ he@@ im@@ sch@@ re@@ i@@ ber &quot; machine .
this was a telep@@ r@@ inter rotor cipher attachment co@@ den@@ amed &quot; Tun@@ ny &quot; at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park .
Tur@@ ing@@ ery was a method of &quot; wheel @-@ breaking &quot; , i.e. , a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tun@@ ny &apos;s wheels .
he also introduced the Tun@@ ny team to Tommy Flowers who , under the guidance of Max New@@ man , went on to build the Col@@ os@@ sus computer , the world &apos;s first programmable digital electronic computer , which replaced a simpler prior machine , and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryp@@ tion techniques to be applied usefully to the messages .
some have mistakenly said that Tur@@ ing was a key figure in the design of the Col@@ os@@ sus computer .
Tur@@ ing@@ ery and the statistical approach of Ban@@ bur@@ is@@ mus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryp@@ t@@ analysis of the Lor@@ en@@ z cipher , but he was not directly involved in the Col@@ os@@ sus development .
</p>
<p>
following his work at Bell Lab@@ s in the US , Tur@@ ing pursued the idea of electronic enci@@ ph@@ ering of speech in the telephone system .
in the latter part of the war , he moved in order to work for the Secret Service &apos;s Radio Security Service at Hans@@ l@@ ope Park .
at the park , he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bay@@ ley .
together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine co@@ den@@ amed &quot; Del@@ ilah &quot; .
the machine was intended for different applications , but it lacked the capability for use with long @-@ distance radio transmissions .
in any case , Del@@ ilah was completed too late to be used during the war .
though the system worked fully , with Tur@@ ing demonstrating it to officials by encryp@@ ting and decryp@@ ting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech , Del@@ ilah was not adopted for use .
Tur@@ ing also consulted with Bell Lab@@ s on the development of SIG@@ SA@@ LY , a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war .
</p>
<p>
between 1945 and 1947 , Tur@@ ing lived in Hamp@@ ton , London , while he worked on the design of the A@@ CE at the National Physical Laboratory .
he presented a paper on 19 February 1946 , which was the first detailed design of a stored @-@ program computer .
von Ne@@ um@@ ann &apos;s incomplete &quot; First Draft of a Report on the ED@@ V@@ AC &quot; had pre@@ dated Tur@@ ing &apos;s paper , but it was much less detailed and , according to John R. W@@ omer@@ sley , Superintendent of the NP@@ L Mathematics Division , it &quot; contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Tur@@ ing &apos;s own . &quot; although A@@ CE was a feasible design , the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned .
in late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sab@@ b@@ atical year during which he produced a seminal work on &quot; Intelligent Machinery &quot; that was not published in his lifetime .
while he was at Cambridge , the Pilot A@@ CE was being built in his absence .
it executed its first program on 10 May 1950 , and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it , including the English Electric DE@@ U@@ CE and the American Ben@@ di@@ x G @-@ 15 .
the full version of Tur@@ ing &apos;s A@@ CE was not built until after his death .
according to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz B@@ illing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics , published by Gen@@ sch@@ er , D@@ ü@@ s@@ sel@@ dorf , there was a meeting between Tur@@ ing and Kon@@ rad Z@@ use .
it took place in Gö@@ t@@ tin@@ gen in 1947 .
the interrogation had the form of a colloquium .
participants were W@@ omer@@ sley , Tur@@ ing , Porter from England and a few German researchers like Z@@ use , Wal@@ ther , and B@@ illing .
in 1948 , Tur@@ ing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester .
a year later , he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory , where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored @-@ program computers - the Manchester Mark 1 .
during this time , he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics , and in &quot; Computing Machinery and Intelligence &quot; , Tur@@ ing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence , and proposed an experiment that became known as the Tur@@ ing test , an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called &quot; intelligent . &quot; the idea was that a computer could be said to &quot; think &quot; if a human interrog@@ ator could not tell it apart , through conversation , from a human being .
in the paper , Tur@@ ing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind , it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child &apos;s mind and then to subject it to a course of education .
a reversed form of the Tur@@ ing test is widely used on the Internet ; the CA@@ PT@@ CHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer .
in 1948 Tur@@ ing , working with his former undergraduate colleague , D.@@ G. Cham@@ per@@ now@@ ne , began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist .
by 1950 , the program was completed and dubbed the Tur@@ b@@ oc@@ ham@@ p .
in 1952 , he tried to implement it on a Fer@@ ran@@ ti Mark 1 , but lacking enough power , the computer was unable to execute the program .
instead , Tur@@ ing &quot; ran &quot; the program by fli@@ pping through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its instructions on a ch@@ ess@@ board , taking about half an hour per move .
the game was recorded .
according to Gar@@ ry Kas@@ par@@ ov , Tur@@ ing &apos;s program &quot; played a recognizable game of chess . &quot; the program lost to Tur@@ ing &apos;s colleague A@@ lick Gl@@ enn@@ ie , although it is said that it won a game against Cham@@ per@@ now@@ ne &apos;s wife , Isabel .
his Tur@@ ing test was a significant , characteristically provocative , and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence , which continues after more than half a century .
he also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 , used today for solving matrix equations .
</p>
<p>
when Tur@@ ing was 39 years old in 1951 , he turned to mathematical biology , finally publishing his masterpiece &quot; The Chemical Basis of Mor@@ pho@@ genesis &quot; in January 1952 .
he was interested in mor@@ pho@@ genesis , the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms .
among other things , he wanted to understand Fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci phyl@@ lot@@ axis , the existence of Fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci numbers in plant structures .
he suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diff@@ using across space , termed a reaction @-@ diffusion system , could account for &quot; the main phenomena of mor@@ pho@@ genesis . &quot; he used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions .
for example , if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place , and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A , then we say that the reaction is aut@@ oc@@ at@@ aly@@ tic , and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations .
Tur@@ ing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A , but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates , then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did .
to calculate the extent of this , Tur@@ ing would have needed a powerful computer , but these were not so freely available in 1951 , so he had to use linear approxim@@ ations to solve the equations by hand .
these calculations gave the right qualitative results , and produced , for example , a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots .
the Russian bio@@ chemist Boris Bel@@ ou@@ sov had performed experiments with similar results , but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics .
Bel@@ ou@@ sov was not aware of Tur@@ ing &apos;s paper in the &quot; Philosoph@@ ical Transactions of the Royal Society &quot; .
although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood , Tur@@ ing &apos;s work on mor@@ pho@@ genesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology .
one of the early applications of Tur@@ ing &apos;s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats , large and small .
further research in the area suggests that Tur@@ ing &apos;s work can partially explain the growth of &quot; feathers , hair follic@@ les , the branching pattern of lungs , and even the left @-@ right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest . &quot; in 2012 , She@@ th , et al. found that in mice , removal of Ho@@ x genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb , suggesting that Ho@@ x genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Tur@@ ing @-@ type mechanism .
later papers were not available until &quot; Collec@@ ted Works of A. M. Tur@@ ing &quot; was published in 1992 .
</p>
<p>
in 1941 , Tur@@ ing proposed marriage to Hu@@ t 8 colleague Joan Clarke , a fellow mathematician and cryp@@ t@@ analyst , but their engagement was short @-@ lived .
after admitting his homosexuality to his fianc@@ ée , who was reportedly &quot; un@@ fa@@ zed &quot; by the revelation , Tur@@ ing decided that he could not go through with the marriage .
</p>
<p>
in January 1952 , Tur@@ ing was 39 when he started a relationship with Arnold Murray , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old unemployed man .
just before Christmas , Tur@@ ing was walking along Manchester &apos;s Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Reg@@ al Cinema and invited him to lunch .
on 23 January , Tur@@ ing &apos;s house was bur@@ gled .
Murray told Tur@@ ing that he and the burglar were acquainted , and Tur@@ ing reported the crime to the police .
during the investigation , he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray .
homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time , and both men were charged with &quot; gross in@@ decency &quot; under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 18@@ 85 .
initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Tur@@ ing &apos;s solicitor &quot; reserved his defence , &quot; i.e. , did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations .
Tur@@ ing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor , and he entered a plea of guilty .
the case , &quot; Regina v. Tur@@ ing and Murray , &quot; was brought to trial on 31 March 1952 .
Tur@@ ing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation , which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce li@@ bid@@ o .
he accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stil@@ bo@@ est@@ rol , a synthetic o@@ estrogen ; this treatment was continued for the course of one year .
the treatment rendered Tur@@ ing impotent and caused gynaec@@ om@@ as@@ tia , fulfilling in the literal sense Tur@@ ing &apos;s prediction that &quot; no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man , but quite who I &apos;ve not found out . &quot; Murray was given a conditional discharge .
Tur@@ ing &apos;s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters , the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC &amp; CS in 1946 , though he kept his academic job .
he was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 , but was free to visit other European countries .
Tur@@ ing was never accused of espionage but , in common with all who had worked at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park , he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work .
</p>
<p>
on 8 June 1954 , Tur@@ ing &apos;s housekeeper found him dead ; he had died the previous day .
cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death .
when his body was discovered , an apple lay half @-@ eaten beside his bed , and although the apple was not tested for cyanide , it was speculated that this was the means by which Tur@@ ing had consumed a fatal dose .
an inquest determined that he had committed suicide .
Andrew Hod@@ ges and another bi@@ ographer , David Le@@ av@@ itt , have both speculated that Tur@@ ing was re @-@ enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film &quot; Snow White and the Seven D@@ war@@ fs &quot; , his favourite fairy tale .
both men noted that he took &quot; an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the W@@ icked Queen immer@@ ses her apple in the poisonous brew . &quot; Tur@@ ing &apos;s remains were cre@@ mated at Wo@@ king Cre@@ mat@@ or@@ ium on 12 June 1954 and his ashes were scattered in the gardens of the cre@@ mat@@ or@@ ium , just as his father &apos;s had been .
philosophy professor Jack Cop@@ eland has questioned various aspects of the coroner &apos;s historical verdict .
he suggested an alternative explanation for the cause of Tur@@ ing &apos;s death : the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to electro@@ plate gold onto spo@@ ons .
the potassium cyanide was used to dissolve the gold .
Tur@@ ing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room .
Cop@@ eland noted that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison .
Tur@@ ing also habitually ate an apple before going to bed , and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half @-@ eaten .
in addition , Tur@@ ing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment &quot; with good humour &quot; and had shown no sign of despon@@ dency prior to his death .
he even set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday weekend .
bi@@ ographer Andrew Hod@@ ges theor@@ ised that Tur@@ ing arranged the delivery of the equipment in order to deliberately allow his mother plausible deni@@ ability in regard to any suicide claims .
conspiracy theorists pointed out that Tur@@ ing was the cause of intense anxiety to the British authorities at the time of his death .
the secret services feared that commun@@ ists would ent@@ rap prominent homosexuals and use them to gather intelligence .
Tur@@ ing was still engaged in highly classified work when he was also a practising homosexual who holid@@ ayed in European countries near the Iron Cur@@ tain .
it is possible that the secret services considered him too great a security risk and assassinated one of the most brilliant minds in their employ .
Tur@@ ing believed in extra@@ sensory perception , and it has been suggested that his belief in fortune @-@ telling may have caused his depressed mood .
as a youth , Tur@@ ing had been told by a gyp@@ sy fortune @-@ teller that he would be a genius .
shortly before his death , during a day @-@ trip to St Ann@@ es @-@ on Sea with the Green@@ baum family , Tur@@ ing again decided to consult a fortune @-@ teller .
according to the Green@@ ba@@ ums &apos; daughter , Barbara : but it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went ...
then he thought it would be a good idea to go to the P@@ lea@@ sure Beach at Black@@ pool .
we found a fortune @-@ teller &apos;s tent and Alan said he &apos;d like to go in so we waited around for him to come back ...
and this sunny , cheerful vis@@ age had shrunk into a pale , shaking , horror @-@ stricken face .
we don &apos;t know what the fortune @-@ teller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy .
I think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in August 2009 , British programmer John Graham @-@ Cum@@ ming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for Tur@@ ing &apos;s prosecution as a homosexual .
the petition received more than 30,000 signatures .
the Prime Minister , Gordon Brown , acknowledged the petition , releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apolog@@ ising and describing the treatment of Tur@@ ing as &quot; appalling &quot; :
thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Tur@@ ing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated .
while Tur@@ ing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can &apos;t put the clock back , his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him ...
so on behalf of the British government , and all those who live freely thanks to Alan &apos;s work I am very proud to say : we &apos;re sorry , you deserved so much better .
in December 2011 , William Jones created an e @-@ petition requesting that the British government pardon Tur@@ ing for his conviction of &quot; gross in@@ decency &quot; :
we ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Tur@@ ing for the conviction of &quot; gross in@@ decency . &quot; in 1952 , he was convicted of &quot; gross in@@ decency &quot; with another man and was forced to undergo so @-@ called &quot; organ@@ o @-@ therapy &quot; - chemical ca@@ stration .
two years later , he killed himself with cyanide , aged just 41 .
Alan Tur@@ ing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he &apos;d done so much to save .
this remains a shame on the British government and British history .
a pardon can go some way to healing this damage .
it may act as an apology to many of the other gay men , not as well @-@ known as Alan Tur@@ ing , who were subjected to these laws .
the petition gathered over 37,000 signatures , and was supported by Manchester MP John Le@@ ech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McN@@ ally , who said :
a pos@@ thum@@ ous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Tur@@ ing was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence .
he would have known that his offence was against the law and that he would be prosecuted .
it is tragic that Alan Tur@@ ing was convicted of an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd - particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort .
however , the law at the time required a prosecution and , as such , long @-@ standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and , rather than trying to alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right , ensure instead that we never again return to those times .
John Le@@ ech , the MP for Manchester With@@ ington , submitted several bills to Parliament and campaigned with Jones to secure the pardon .
Le@@ ech made the case in the House of Commons that Tur@@ ing &apos;s contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was &quot; ultimately just embarrassing &quot; that the conviction still stood .
Le@@ ech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed .
at the UK premiere of a film based on Tur@@ ing &apos;s life , &quot; The Im@@ itation Game &quot; , the producers thanked Le@@ ech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Tur@@ ing &apos;s pardon .
his campaign turned to acquiring pardons for the 75,000 other men convicted of the same crime .
Le@@ ech &apos;s campaign gained public support from leading scientists , including Stephen Haw@@ king .
on 26 July 2012 , a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Tur@@ ing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 18@@ 85 , of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952 .
late in the year in a letter to &quot; The Daily Telegraph &quot; , the physicist Stephen Haw@@ king and 10 other signatories including the Astronom@@ er Royal Lord Re@@ es , President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse , Lady Tr@@ um@@ p@@ ington and Lord Shar@@ key called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request .
the government indicated it would support the bill , and it passed its third reading in the Lords in October .
at the bill &apos;s second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013 , Conservative MP Christopher Ch@@ ope objected to the bill , delaying its passage .
the bill was due to return to the House of Commons on 28 February 2014 , but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons , the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy .
on 24 December 2013 , Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Tur@@ ing &apos;s conviction for &quot; gross in@@ decency , &quot; with immediate effect .
announcing the pardon , Lord Chancellor Chris Gra@@ y@@ ling said Tur@@ ing deserved to be &quot; remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort &quot; and not for his later criminal conviction .
the Queen officially pronounced Tur@@ ing pardoned in August 2014 .
the Queen &apos;s action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War .
pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent , and a request has been made by the family or other interested party ; neither condition was met in regard to Tur@@ ing &apos;s conviction .
in a letter to the Prime Minister , David Cameron , human rights advocate Peter Tat@@ ch@@ ell criticised the decision to single out Tur@@ ing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons .
Tat@@ ch@@ ell also called for a new investigation into Tur@@ ing &apos;s death :
a new inquiry is long overdue , even if only to dispel any doubts about the true cause of his death - including speculation that he was murdered by the security services .
I think murder by state agents is unlikely .
there is no known evidence pointing to any such act .
however , it is a major failing that this possibility has never been considered or investigated .
in September 2016 , the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exon@@ eration to other men convicted of similar historical in@@ decency offences , in what was described as an &quot; Alan Tur@@ ing law . &quot; the Alan Tur@@ ing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom , contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017 , which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts .
the law applies in England and Wales .

<p>
Tur@@ ing was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire 1946 .
he was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1951 .
</p>
<p>
various institutions have paid tribute to Tur@@ ing by naming things after him including :
a biography published by the Royal Society shortly after Tur@@ ing &apos;s death , while his wartime work was still subject to the Official Secrets Act , recorded :
three remarkable papers written just before the war , on three diverse mathematical subjects , show the quality of the work that might have been produced if he had settled down to work on some big problem at that critical time .
for his work at the Foreign Office he was awarded the OB@@ E .
since 1966 , the Tur@@ ing Award has been given annually by the Association for Computing Machinery for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community .
it is widely considered to be the computing world &apos;s highest honour , equivalent to the Nobel Prize .
on 23 June 1998 , on what would have been Tur@@ ing &apos;s 86th birthday , his bi@@ ographer , Andrew Hod@@ ges , unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at his birthplace in War@@ rington Crescent , London , later the Col@@ onn@@ ade Hotel .
to mark the 50th anniversary of his death , a memorial plaque was unveiled on 7 June 2004 at his former residence , Hol@@ ly@@ me@@ ade , in Wil@@ m@@ slow , Ches@@ hire .
on 13 March 2000 , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines issued a set of postage stamps to celebrate the greatest achievements of the 20th century , one of which carries a portrait of Tur@@ ing against a background of repeated 0s and 1@@ s , and is cap@@ tioned :
&quot; 1937 : Alan Tur@@ ing &apos;s theory of digital computing . &quot; on 1 April 2003 , Tur@@ ing &apos;s work at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park was named an I@@ EEE Mil@@ estone .
on 28 October 2004 , a bronze statue of Tur@@ ing sculp@@ ted by John W. Mills was unveiled at the University of Surrey in Guil@@ d@@ ford , marking the 50th anniversary of Tur@@ ing &apos;s death ; it portrays him carrying his books across the campus .
Tur@@ ing was one of four mathematicians examined in the BBC documentary entitled &quot; Dangerous Knowledge &quot; .
the &quot; Princeton Alumni Weekly &quot; named Tur@@ ing the second most significant alum@@ n@@ us in the history of Princeton University , second only to President James Madison .
a 1.5 @-@ ton , life @-@ size statue of Tur@@ ing was unveiled on 19 June 2007 at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park .
built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh slate , it was sculp@@ ted by Stephen Ket@@ tle , having been commissioned by the American billionaire Sid@@ ney Frank .
Tur@@ ing has been honoured in various ways in Manchester , the city where he worked towards the end of his life .
in 1994 , a stretch of the A@@ 60@@ 10 road was named &quot; Alan Tur@@ ing Way . &quot; a bridge carrying this road was widened , and carries the name Alan Tur@@ ing Bridge .
a statue of Tur@@ ing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in S@@ ack@@ ville Park , between the University of Manchester building on Whit@@ worth Street and Canal Street .
the memorial statue depicts the &quot; father of computer science &quot; sitting on a bench at a central position in the park .
Tur@@ ing is shown holding an apple .
the cast bronze bench carries in relief the text &apos; Alan Math@@ ison Tur@@ ing 1912 @-@ 1954 &apos; , and the motto &apos; Founder of Computer Science &apos; as it could appear if encoded by an En@@ ig@@ ma machine : &apos; IE@@ K@@ Y@@ F RO@@ MSI AD@@ X@@ U@@ O K@@ V@@ K@@ Z@@ C GU@@ B@@ J &apos; .
however , the meaning of the coded message is disputed , as the &apos; u &apos; in &apos; computer &apos; matches up with the &apos; u &apos; in &apos; AD@@ X@@ U@@ O &apos; .
as a letter encoded by an enig@@ ma machine can not appear as itself , the actual message behind the code is uncertain .
a plaque at the statue &apos;s feet reads &apos; Father of computer science , mathematician , log@@ ician , wartime co@@ deb@@ re@@ aker , victim of prejudice &apos; .
in 2006 , British writer and mathematician I@@ oan James chose Tur@@ ing as one of twenty people to feature in his book about famous historical figures who may have had some of the traits of As@@ per@@ ger syndrome .
in 2010 , actor / play@@ wright Jade E@@ ste@@ ban E@@ stra@@ da portrayed Tur@@ ing in the solo musical , &quot; I@@ cons : the Lesbian and Gay History of the World , Vol . 4 &quot; .
in 2011 , in &quot; The Guardian &quot; s &quot; My hero &quot; series , writer Alan Gar@@ ner chose Tur@@ ing as his hero and described how they had met while out jogging in the early 1950s .
Gar@@ ner remembered Tur@@ ing as &quot; funny and witty &quot; and said that he &quot; talked endlessly . &quot; in 2006 , Tur@@ ing was named with online resources as an LGBT History Month I@@ con .
in 2006 , Boston Pride named Tur@@ ing their Honorary Grand Marshal .
the logo of Apple Inc. is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Tur@@ ing , with the bite mark a reference to his death .
both the designer of the logo and the company deny that there is any homage to Tur@@ ing in the design .
Stephen F@@ ry has recounted asking Steve Jobs whether the design was intentional , saying that Jobs &apos; response was , &quot; God , we wish it were . &quot; in February 2011 , Tur@@ ing &apos;s papers from the Second World War were bought for the nation with an 11th @-@ hour bid by the National Heritage Memorial Fund , allowing them to stay at B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park .
in 2012 , Tur@@ ing was induc@@ ted into the Legacy Walk , an outdoor public display that celebrates LGBT history and people .
the song &quot; Alan et la Pom@@ me , &quot; by francophone singer @-@ song@@ writer Salv@@ at@@ ore Ad@@ amo , is a tribute to Tur@@ ing .
Tur@@ ing &apos;s life and work featured in a BBC children &apos;s programme about famous scientists , &quot; Ab@@ solute Gen@@ ius with Dick and D@@ om &quot; , first broadcast on 12 March 2014 .
on 17 May 2014 , the world &apos;s first work of public art to recognise Tur@@ ing as gay was commissioned in B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley , close by to B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park where his war @-@ time work was carried out .
the commission was announced to mark International Day Against Hom@@ ophobia and Trans@@ phobia .
the work was unveiled at a ceremony on Tur@@ ing &apos;s birthday , 23 June 2014 , and is placed alongside busy Wat@@ ling Street , the old main road to London , where Tur@@ ing himself would have passed by on many occasions .
on 22 October 2014 , Tur@@ ing was induc@@ ted into the NSA Hall of Honor .
in February 2019 , in the BBC eight @-@ part series &quot; &quot; , Tur@@ ing was voted by viewers to be the Great@@ est Person .

to mark the 100th anniversary of Tur@@ ing &apos;s birth , the Tur@@ ing Cent@@ enary Advisory Committee co @-@ ordinated the Alan Tur@@ ing Year , a year @-@ long programme of events around the world honouring Tur@@ ing &apos;s life and achievements .
the T@@ CAC , chaired by S. Barry Cooper with Tur@@ ing &apos;s nephew Sir John Der@@ mot Tur@@ ing acting as Honorary President , worked with the University of Manchester faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park .
on 23 June 2012 , Google featured an interactive d@@ oodle where visitors had to change the instructions of a Tur@@ ing Machine , so when run , the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence , featuring &quot; Google &quot; in Ba@@ ud@@ ot @-@ Murray code .
the B@@ let@@ ch@@ ley Park Trust collaborated with W@@ inning Mo@@ ves to publish an Alan Tur@@ ing edition of the board game Mono@@ poly .

Alexander Mack@@ enz@@ ie , was a Scottish @-@ Canadian politician who served as the second prime minister of Canada , in office from 18@@ 73 to 18@@ 78 .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie was born in Lo@@ gi@@ er@@ a@@ it , Per@@ th@@ shire , Scotland .
he left school at the age of 13 , following his father &apos;s death , and trained as a ston@@ em@@ ason .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie im@@ migrated to Canada when he was 19 , settling in what became Ontario .
his masonry business prospered , allowing him to pursue other interests - such as the ed@@ it@@ orship of a pro @-@ Re@@ form@@ ist of a newspaper called &quot; the L@@ amb@@ ton Shield . &quot; Mack@@ enz@@ ie was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada in 1861 , as a supporter of George Brown .
in 1867 , Mack@@ enz@@ ie was elected to the new House of Commons of Canada for the Liberal Party .
he became leader of the party in mid @-@ 18@@ 73 , and a few months later succeeded John A. Mac@@ don@@ ald as prime minister , following Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s resignation in the aftermath of the Pacific Scand@@ al .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie and the Liber@@ als won a clear majority at the 1874 election .
he was popular among the general public for his humble background and apparent democratic tendencies .
as prime minister , Mack@@ enz@@ ie continued the nation @-@ building programme that had been begun by his predecessor .
his government established the Supreme Court of Canada and Royal Military College of Canada , and created the District of Ke@@ ew@@ atin to better administer Canada &apos;s newly acquired western territories .
however , it made little progress on the trans@@ continental railway , and struggled to deal with the aftermath of the Pan@@ ic of 18@@ 73 .
at the 18@@ 78 election , Mack@@ enz@@ ie &apos;s government suffered a landslide defeat .
he remained leader of the Liberal Party for another two years , and continued on as a member of parliament until his death , due to a stroke .
</p>
<p>
Mack@@ enz@@ ie was born on 28 January 1822 in Lo@@ gi@@ er@@ a@@ it , Per@@ th@@ shire , Scotland , the son of Mary Stewart and Alexander Mack@@ enz@@ ie Sr. who were married in 1817 .
the site of his birthplace is known as Cla@@ is@@ - &apos; n @-@ de@@ o@@ ir &quot; The Hol@@ low of the We@@ eping , &quot; where families said their good@@ b@@ yes as the convicted were led to nearby G@@ allows Hill .
the house he was born in was built by his father and is still standing in 2019 .
he was the third of ten boys , seven of who survived infancy .
Alexander Mack@@ enz@@ ie Sr. was a carpenter and ship &apos;s jo@@ iner who had to move around frequently for work after the end of the Napole@@ onic Wars in 1815 .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie &apos;s father died on 7 March 18@@ 36 and at the age of thirteen Alexander Mack@@ enz@@ ie J@@ r. was thus forced to end his formal education in order to help support his family .
he apprentic@@ ed as a ston@@ em@@ ason and met his future wife , Helen Neil , in Ir@@ vine , where her father was also a ston@@ em@@ ason .
the Ne@@ ils were Baptist and shortly thereafter , Mack@@ enz@@ ie converted from Presby@@ ter@@ i@@ anism to Baptist beliefs .
together with the Ne@@ ils , he im@@ migrated to Canada in 18@@ 42 to seek a better life .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie &apos;s faith was to link him to the increasingly influential temper@@ ance cause , particularly strong in Canada West where he lived , a constituency of which he was to represent in the Parliament of Canada .
the Ne@@ ils and Mack@@ enz@@ ie settled in Kingston , Ontario .
the limestone in the area proved too hard for his ston@@ em@@ ason tools and , not having money to buy new tools , Mack@@ enz@@ ie took a job as a labourer constructing a building on Princess Street .
the contractor on the job claimed financial difficulty and so Mack@@ enz@@ ie accepted a promissory note for summer wages .
the note later proved to be worthless .
subsequently , Mack@@ enz@@ ie won a contract building a bomb @-@ proof arch at Fort Henry .
he later became a foreman on the construction of Kingston &apos;s four Mart@@ ello Towers - Mur@@ ney Tower , Fort Frederick , Cath@@ cart Tower , and Sho@@ al Tower .
he was also a foreman on the construction of the Wel@@ land Canal and the L@@ ach@@ ine Canal .
while working on the Beau@@ har@@ no@@ is Canal a one @-@ ton stone fell and crushed one of his legs .
he recovered but never regained the strength in that leg .
it was while in Kingston that Mack@@ enz@@ ie became a vocal opponent of religious and political entitlement and corruption in government .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie married Helen Neil in 18@@ 45 and with her had three children , with only one girl , Mary , surviving infancy .
he and Helen moved to Sar@@ nia , Ontario in 18@@ 47 and Mary was born in 1848 .
they were soon joined from Scotland by the rest of Mack@@ enz@@ ie &apos;s brothers and his mother .
he began working as a general contractor , earning a reputation for being a hard working , honest man as well as having a working man &apos;s view on fiscal policy .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie helped construct many cour@@ thouses and jails across southern Ontario .
a number of these still stand today including the Sandwich Cour@@ thouse and J@@ ail now known as the Mack@@ enz@@ ie Hall Cultural Centre in Windsor , Ontario and the Kent County Cour@@ thouse and J@@ ail in Cha@@ tham , Ontario .
he even bid , unsuccessfully , on the construction of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa in 1859 .
Helen died in 18@@ 52 , finally succum@@ bing to the effects of excessive doses of mercury @-@ based cal@@ om@@ el used to treat a fever while in Kingston .
in 18@@ 53 , he married Jane Sy@@ m .
</p>
<p>
Mack@@ enz@@ ie involved himself in politics almost from the moment he arrived in Canada .
he fought passionately for equality and the elimination of all forms of class distinction .
in 18@@ 51 he became the Secretary for the Reform Party for L@@ amb@@ ton .
after convincing him to run in Kent / L@@ amb@@ ton , Mack@@ enz@@ ie campaigned relentlessly for George Brown , owner of the Re@@ form@@ ist paper &quot; The Globe &quot; in the 18@@ 51 election , helping Brown to win his first seat in the Legislative Assembly .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie and Brown remained the closest of friends and colleagues for the rest of their lives .
in 18@@ 52 Mack@@ enz@@ ie became editor of another reform@@ ist paper , the L@@ amb@@ ton Shield .
as editor , Mack@@ enz@@ ie was perhaps a little too vocal , leading the paper to a lawsuit for libel against the local conservative candidate .
because a key witness claimed Cabinet Confidence and would not testify , the paper lost the suit and was forced to fold due to financial hardship .
after his brother , Hope Mack@@ enz@@ ie , declined to run , Alexander was petitioned to run and won his first seat in the Legislative Assembly as a supporter of George Brown in 1861 .
when George Brown resigned from the Great Coalition in 18@@ 65 over reciprocity negotiations with the United States , Mack@@ enz@@ ie was invited to replace him as the President of the Council .
wary of Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s motivations and true to his principles , Mack@@ enz@@ ie declined .
he entered the House of Commons of Canada in 1867 , representing the L@@ amb@@ ton , Ontario , riding .
there was no cohesive national Liberal Party of Canada at the time and with George Brown not winning his seat , there was no official leader .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie did not believe he was the best qualified for the position and although he resisted offers of the position , he nevertheless sat as the de facto leader of the Official Opposition .
</p>
<p>
when the Mac@@ don@@ ald government fell due to the Pacific Scand@@ al in 18@@ 73 , the Governor General , Lord Du@@ ffer@@ in , called upon Mack@@ enz@@ ie , who had been chosen as the leader of the Liberal Party a few months earlier , to form a new government .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie formed a government and asked the Governor General to call an election for January 1874 .
the Liber@@ als won , having garnered 5@@ 3.8 % of the popular vote .
the voter support of 5@@ 3.8 % remains the record in Canada for all federal elections .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie remained prime minister until the 18@@ 78 election when Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s Conserv@@ atives returned to power with a majority government .
it was unusual for a man of Mack@@ enz@@ ie &apos;s humble origins to attain such a position in an age which generally offered such opportunity only to the privileged .
Lord Du@@ ffer@@ in , the current Governor General , expressed early misgivings about a ston@@ em@@ ason taking over government .
but on meeting Mack@@ enz@@ ie , Du@@ ffer@@ in revised his opinions : however narrow and inexperienced Mack@@ enz@@ ie may be , I imagine he is a thoroughly upright , well @-@ principled , and well @-@ meaning man .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie served concurrently as Minister of Public Works and oversaw the completion of the Parliament Buildings .
while drawing up the plans for the West Block , he included a circular staircase leading directly from his office to the outside of the building which allowed him to escape the patronage @-@ seekers waiting for him in his ante @-@ chamber .
proving Du@@ ffer@@ in &apos;s reflections on his character to be true , Mack@@ enz@@ ie disliked intensely the patronage inherent in politics .
nevertheless , he found it a necessary evil in order to maintain party unity and ensure the loyalty of his fellow Liber@@ als .
in keeping with his democratic ideals , Mack@@ enz@@ ie refused the offer of a kn@@ igh@@ thood three times , and was thus the only one of Canada &apos;s first eight Prime Ministers not to be kn@@ ighted .
he also declined appointment to the UK Privy Council and hence does not bear the title &quot; Right Honourable . &quot; his pride in his working class origins never left him .
once , while touring Fort Henry as prime minister , he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them .
the embarrassed escort confessed that he didn &apos;t and Mack@@ enz@@ ie replied , &quot; I do . it is five feet , ten inches . I know , because I built it myself ! &quot; as Prime Minister , Alexander Mack@@ enz@@ ie strove to reform and simplify the machinery of government , achieving a remarkable record of reform legislation .
he introduced the secret ballot ; advised the creation of the Supreme Court of Canada ; the establishment of the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston in 1874 ; and , the creation of the Office of the Auditor General in 18@@ 78 .
he completed the Inter@@ colonial Railway but struggled to progress on the national railway due to a worldwide economic depression , almost coming to blows with the then Governor General Lord Du@@ ffer@@ in over imperial interference .
Mack@@ enz@@ ie stood up for the rights of Canada as a nation and fought for the supremacy of Parliament and honesty in government .
above all else , he was known and loved for his honesty and integrity .
however , his term was marked by economic depression that had grown out of the Pan@@ ic of 18@@ 73 , which Mack@@ enz@@ ie &apos;s government was unable to alleviate .
in 1874 , Mack@@ enz@@ ie negotiated a new free trade agreement with the United States , eliminating the high protective tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets .
however , this action did not bolster the economy , and construction of the CPR slowed drastically due to lack of funding .
in 18@@ 76 the Conservative opposition announced a National Policy of protective tariffs , which reson@@ ated with voters .
when an election was held at the conclusion of Mack@@ enz@@ ie &apos;s five @-@ year term , the Conserv@@ atives were swept back into office in a landslide victory .
</p>
<p>
after his government &apos;s defeat , Mack@@ enz@@ ie remained Leader of the Opposition for another two years , until 1880 .
he was soon struck with a mysterious ailment that s@@ apped his strength and all but took his voice .
sitting in silence , he nevertheless remained an un@@ defeated MP until his death in 18@@ 92 from a stroke that resulted from hitting his head during a fall .
he died in Toronto and was buried in Lak@@ evi@@ ew Cemetery in Sar@@ nia , Ontario .
</p>
<p>
Mack@@ enz@@ ie &apos;s first biography in 18@@ 92 referred to him as Canada &apos;s S@@ tain@@ less States@@ man .
here are a number of other references to his character .
he was a devout Baptist and te@@ et@@ ot@@ all@@ er who found refuge in , and drew strength from , his family , friends and faith .
he was also a loyal friend and an in@@ cor@@ ri@@ gible pr@@ ank@@ ster .
un@@ pretentious and down to earth , his public official austerity in striking contrast to private compassion and giving nature .
he was the soul of honour and integrity , a proud man who sought no recognition or personal enrichment and accepted gifts reluctantly .
he preferred to follow than lead and often found duty outweighed heavy burden of office .
he was uncompromising on his principles ; perhaps too much so .
an historian at the time said , &quot; He was , and ever will remain , the Sir Gal@@ a@@ had of Canadian politics &quot; .
very proud of his Scottish heritage he was forever a Sco@@ t &quot; Nem@@ o me imp@@ une lac@@ es@@ sit &quot; .
the Upper Canada rebellion leader W.@@ L. Mack@@ enz@@ ie referred to him as &quot; He is every whit a self @-@ made , self @-@ educated man . has large mental capacity and indomitable energy . &quot; .
and Canada &apos;s Governor General , Lord Du@@ ffer@@ in said of him he is &quot; as pure as crystal , and as true as steel , with lots of common sense . &quot; .
a close friend , Chief Justice Sir Louis Davies said he was &quot; the best deb@@ ater the House of Commons has ever known . &quot; .
a friend and colleague in Cabinet who went on to become prime minister of Canada , Sir Wil@@ fred Lau@@ rier said he was &quot; one of the tru@@ est and strongest characters to be met within Canadian history . he was endowed with a warm heart and a copious and rich fancy , though veiled by a somewhat retic@@ ent exterior , and he was of friends the most tender and true . &quot; .
another friend and colleague , who went on to become premier of Ontario , Sir George Ross said &quot; Mack@@ enz@@ ie was sui generis a deb@@ ater . his humorous sal@@ lies bl@@ istered like a blast from a flaming smelter . his sterling honesty is a great heritage , and will keep his memory green to all future generations . &quot; .
at his eul@@ ogy , Rev. Dr. Thomas compared him to the Duke of Wellington who &quot; stood four square , to all the winds that blow . &quot; .
newspaper around the world and in Canada had this to say about him .
the London Times - the untiring energy , the business @-@ like accuracy , the keen perception and reliable judgment , and above all the inflexible integrity which marked his private life , he carried without abatement of one jot into his public career . .
the Westminster Review - a man , who although , through failing health and failing voice , he had virtually passed out of public life , yet retained to the last the affectionate ven@@ eration of the Canadian people as no other man of the time can be said to have done . .
the Charlot@@ te@@ town Patri@@ ot - in all that constitutes the real man , the honest statesman , the true patriot , the warm friend , and sincere Christian , he had few equals .
possessed of a clear intellect , a reten@@ tive memory , and a ready command of appropriate words , he was one of the most logical and powerful speakers we have ever heard . .
the St. John Telegraph - he was loved by the people and his political opponents were compelled to respect him even above their own chosen leader .
as a statesman , he has had few equals . .
the Montreal Star - it is one of the very foremost architects of the Canadian nationality that we mourn .
in the dark days of &quot; 73 Canadians were in a state of panic , distr@@ usting the stability of their newly @-@ built Dom@@ inion ; no one can tell what would have happened had not the stal@@ wart form of Alexander Mack@@ enz@@ ie lifted itself above the screaming , vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ating and denying mass of politicians , and all Canada felt at once , there was a man who could be trusted . .
the Toronto Globe - he was a man who loved the people and fought for their rights against privilege and monopoly in every form . .
the Philadelphia Record - Like Caesar , who twice refused a kn@@ igh@@ tly crown , Alexander Mack@@ enz@@ ie refused kn@@ igh@@ thood three times .
unlike Caesar , he owed his political overthrow to his in@@ corrup@@ tible honesty and unswerving integrity . .

Anton@@ in@@ us Pi@@ us , also known as Anton@@ in@@ us , was Roman emperor from 138 to 161 .
he was one of the Five Good Em@@ per@@ ors in the Ner@@ va @-@ Anton@@ ine dynasty and the Au@@ reli@@ i .
born into a senatorial family , Anton@@ in@@ us held various offices during the reign of emperor Had@@ rian , acquiring favor which saw him adopted as Had@@ rian &apos;s son and successor shortly before Had@@ rian &apos;s death .
he acquired the name Pi@@ us after his accession to the throne , either because he compelled the Senate to de@@ ify his adoptive father Had@@ rian , or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Had@@ rian in his later years .
his reign is notable for the peaceful state of the Empire , with no major revol@@ ts or military incursions during this time , and for his governing without ever leaving Italy .
a successful military campaign in southern Scotland early in his reign resulted in the construction of the Anton@@ ine Wall .
Anton@@ in@@ us was an effective administrator , leaving his successors a large surplus in the treasury , expanding free access to drinking water throughout the Empire , encouraging legal conformity , and facilitating the en@@ franchis@@ ement of freed slaves .
he died of illness in 161 and was succeeded by his adopted sons Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us and Luci@@ us Ver@@ us as co @-@ emperors .
</p>
<p>
he was born as the only child of Tit@@ us Au@@ reli@@ us Ful@@ v@@ us , consul in 86 , whose family came from Nem@@ au@@ sus .
Tit@@ us Au@@ reli@@ us Ful@@ vi@@ us was the son of a senator of the same name , who , as leg@@ ate of Leg@@ io III Gal@@ lica , had supported Ves@@ pa@@ sian in his bid to the Imperial office and been rewarded with a su@@ ffec@@ t consul@@ ship , plus an ordinary one under Dom@@ iti@@ an in 85 .
the Au@@ reli@@ i Ful@@ vii were therefore a relatively new senatorial family from G@@ alli@@ a Nar@@ bon@@ ensis whose rise to prominence was supported by the Fla@@ vians .
the link between Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; family and their home province explains the increasing importance of the post of Pro@@ consul of G@@ alli@@ a Nar@@ bon@@ ensis during the late Second Century .
Anton@@ in@@ us was born near L@@ anu@@ vi@@ um and his mother was Arria Fad@@ illa .
Anton@@ in@@ us &quot; father died shortly after his 89 ordinary consul@@ ship , and Anton@@ in@@ us was raised by his maternal grandfather G@@ na@@ eus Ar@@ ri@@ us Anton@@ in@@ us , reputed by contemporaries to be a man of integrity and culture and a friend of Pl@@ iny the Youn@@ ger .
the Ar@@ ri@@ i Anton@@ ini were an older senatorial family from Italy , very influential during Ner@@ va &apos;s reign .
Arria Fad@@ illa , Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; mother , married afterwards Publ@@ ius Julius Lu@@ pus , su@@ ffec@@ t consul in 98 ; from that marriage came two daughters , Arria Lup@@ ula and Julia Fad@@ illa .
</p>
<p>
some time between 110 and 115 , Anton@@ in@@ us married Ann@@ ia Gal@@ eria Faus@@ tina the Elder .
they are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage .
Faus@@ tina was the daughter of consul Marcus Ann@@ ius Ver@@ us and Rup@@ ilia Faus@@ tina .
Faus@@ tina was a beautiful woman , and despite rumours about her character , it is clear that Anton@@ in@@ us cared for her deeply .
Faus@@ tina bore Anton@@ in@@ us four children , two sons and two daughters .
they were : when Faus@@ tina died in 141 , Anton@@ in@@ us was greatly distressed .
in honour of her memory , he asked the Senate to de@@ ify her as a goddess , and authorised the construction of a temple to be built in the Roman Forum in her name , with pri@@ est@@ esses serving in her temple .
he had various coins with her portrait struck in her honor .
these coins were scripted &quot; &quot; DI@@ VA FA@@ US@@ T@@ INA &quot; &quot; and were elabor@@ ately decorated .
he further created a charity which he founded and called it &quot; Pu@@ el@@ la@@ e Faus@@ tin@@ i@@ an@@ ae &quot; or &quot; Girls of Faus@@ tina &quot; , which assisted destitute girls of good family .
finally , Anton@@ in@@ us created a new &quot; ali@@ menta &quot; .
the emperor never re@@ married .
instead , he lived with Gal@@ ena Ly@@ si@@ strata , one of Faus@@ tina &apos;s freed women .
concub@@ inage was a form of female companionship sometimes chosen by powerful men in Ancient Rome , especially wid@@ owers like Ves@@ pa@@ sian , and Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us .
their union could not produce any legitimate offspring who could threaten any heirs , such as those of Anton@@ in@@ us .
also , as one could not have a wife and an official concubine at the same time , Anton@@ in@@ us avoided being pressed into a marriage with a nobl@@ ew@@ oman from another family .
</p>
<p>
having filled the offices of qu@@ a@@ est@@ or and pra@@ e@@ tor with more than usual success , he obtained the consul@@ ship in 120 .
he was next appointed by the Emperor Had@@ rian as one of the four pro@@ consul@@ s to administer It@@ alia , then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as pro@@ consul of Asia , probably during 134 @-@ 135 .
he acquired much favor with Had@@ rian , who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138 , after the death of his first adopted son Luci@@ us A@@ eli@@ us , on the condition that Anton@@ in@@ us would in turn adopt Marcus Ann@@ ius Ver@@ us , the son of his wife &apos;s brother , and Luci@@ us , son of Luci@@ us A@@ eli@@ us , who afterwards became the emperors Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us and Luci@@ us Ver@@ us .
</p>
<p>
on his accession , Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; name and style became &quot; Im@@ per@@ ator Caesar Tit@@ us A@@ eli@@ us Had@@ ri@@ anus Anton@@ in@@ us August@@ us Pontif@@ ex Maxim@@ us &quot; .
one of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the Senate to grant divine honours to Had@@ rian , which they had at first refused ; his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of &quot; Pi@@ us &quot; .
two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father @-@ in @-@ law with his hand at Senate meetings , and that he had saved those men that Had@@ rian , during his period of ill @-@ health , had condemned to death .
immediately after Had@@ rian &apos;s death , Anton@@ in@@ us approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended :
Marcus &apos; betrothal to C@@ ei@@ onia Fab@@ ia would be annulled , and he would be betro@@ thed to Faus@@ tina , Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; daughter , instead .
Faus@@ tina &apos;s betrothal to C@@ ei@@ onia &apos;s brother Luci@@ us Comm@@ o@@ dus would also have to be annulled .
Marcus consented to Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; proposal .
Anton@@ in@@ us built temples , theaters , and ma@@ us@@ ol@@ eums , promoted the arts and sciences , and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of rhetoric and philosophy .
Anton@@ in@@ us made few initial changes when he became emperor , leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Had@@ rian .
epig@@ raph@@ ical and pro@@ so@@ po@@ graphical research has revealed that Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; imperial ruling team centered around a group of closely knit senatorial families , most of them members of the pri@@ estly congregation for the cult of Had@@ rian , the &quot; so@@ d@@ ales Had@@ ri@@ an@@ ales &quot; .
according to the German historian H.@@ G. P@@ fla@@ um , pro@@ so@@ po@@ graphical research of Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; ruling team allows us to grasp the deeply conservative character of the ruling senatorial caste .
</p>
<p>
there are no records of any military related acts in his time in which he participated .
one modern scholar has written &quot; It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see , let alone command , a Roman army , but that , throughout the twenty @-@ three years of his reign , he never went within five hundred miles of a leg@@ ion . &quot; his reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the Princip@@ ate , notwithstanding the fact that there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time .
such disturbances happened in Mau@@ ret@@ ania - where a senator was named as governor of Mau@@ ret@@ ania Ting@@ it@@ ana in place of the usual equ@@ estrian procurator and cavalry reinforcements from P@@ ann@@ onia were brought in , towns such as Sal@@ a and T@@ ip@@ asa being fortified .
similar disturbances took place in Judea , and amongst the Bri@@ gan@@ tes in Brit@@ ann@@ ia , none of them being considered serious .
it was however in Britain that Anton@@ in@@ us decided to follow a new , more aggressive path , with the appointment of a new governor in 139 , Quin@@ tus L@@ ol@@ li@@ us Ur@@ bic@@ us , a native of Num@@ i@@ dia and previously governor of Ger@@ mania In@@ fer@@ ior .
under instructions from the emperor , L@@ ol@@ li@@ us undertook an invasion of southern Scotland , winning some significant victories , and constructing the Anton@@ ine Wall from the Fir@@ th of For@@ th to the Fir@@ th of C@@ ly@@ de .
the wall , however , was soon gradually decommissioned during the mid @-@ 15@@ 0s and eventually abandoned late during the reign , for reasons that are still not quite clear .
Anton@@ ine &apos;s Wall is mentioned in just one literary source , Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; biography in the Hist@@ oria Augu@@ sta .
P@@ aus@@ ani@@ as makes a brief and confused mention of a war in Britain .
in one inscription honoring Anton@@ in@@ us , erected by Leg@@ io II Augu@@ sta , which participated in the building of the Wall , a relief showing four naked prisoners , one of them be@@ headed , seems to stand for some actual warfare .
although Anton@@ ine &apos;s Wall was , in principle , much shorter and at first sight more defensible than Had@@ rian &apos;s Wall , the additional area that it enclosed within the Empire was barren , with the effect that supply lines to it were strained enough that the costs from maintaining the additional territory outweighed the benefits of doing so .
it has been therefore speculated that the invasion of Low@@ land Scotland and the building of the wall had to do mostly with internal politics , that is , offering Anton@@ in@@ us an opportunity to gain some mo@@ dic@@ um of necessary military prestige at the start of his reign .
actually , the campaign in Brit@@ ann@@ ia was followed by an Imperial salutation - that is , by Anton@@ in@@ us formally taking for the second time the title of Im@@ per@@ ator - in 142 .
the fact that around the same time coins were struck announcing a victory in Britain points to Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; need to publicize his achievements .
the or@@ ator Fron@@ to was later to say that , although Anton@@ in@@ us bestowed the direction of the British campaign to others , he should be regarded as the hel@@ m@@ sman who directed the voyage , whose glory , therefore , belonged to him .
that this quest for some military achievement responded to an actual need is proved by the fact that , although generally peaceful , Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; reign was not free from attempts at usurpation :
Hist@@ oria Augu@@ sta mentions two , made by the senators Corn@@ eli@@ us Pris@@ ci@@ anus and Ati@@ li@@ us Ru@@ fi@@ us T@@ iti@@ anus - both confirmed by the Fas@@ ti O@@ sti@@ enses as well as by the er@@ asing of Pris@@ ci@@ anus &apos; name from an inscription .
in both cases , Anton@@ in@@ us was not in formal charge of the ensuing repression :
Pris@@ ci@@ anus committed suicide and T@@ iti@@ anus was found guilty by the Senate , with Anton@@ in@@ us abstaining from sequest@@ ering their families &apos; properties .
there were also some troubles in D@@ acia In@@ fer@@ ior which required the granting of additional powers to the procurator governor and the dispatch of additional soldiers to the province .
on the Northern Black Sea coast , the Greek city of Ol@@ bia was held against the Scy@@ thians .
also during his reign the governor of Upper Germany , probably Cai@@ us Pop@@ illi@@ us Car@@ us Ped@@ o , built new forti@@ fications in the Ag@@ ri Dec@@ um@@ ates , advancing the Lim@@ es German@@ icus fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring Ra@@ e@@ tia .
in the East , Roman su@@ zer@@ ain@@ ty over Armenia was retained by the choice in AD 140 of Ar@@ sac@@ id sci@@ on So@@ haem@@ us as client king .
nevertheless , Anton@@ in@@ us was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign , but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ep@@ he@@ sus .
this style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations .
Anton@@ in@@ us was the last Roman Emperor recognised by the Indian King@@ doms .
Raoul Mc@@ Lau@@ gh@@ lin quotes Au@@ reli@@ us Victor as saying &quot; The Indians , the Bac@@ tri@@ ans and the Hy@@ r@@ can@@ ians all sent ambassadors to Anton@@ in@@ us . they had all heard about the spirit of justice held by this great emperor , justice that was heightened by his handsome and grave countenance , and his slim and vigorous figure . &quot; due to the outbreak of the Anton@@ ine epidemic and wars against northern German@@ ic tribes , the reign of Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us was forced to alter the focus of foreign policies , and matters relating to the Far East were increasingly abandoned in favour of those directly concerning the Empire &apos;s survival .
</p>
<p>
Anton@@ in@@ us was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder .
in spite of an extensive building directive - the free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqu@@ educ@@ ts , not only in Rome but throughout the Empire , as well as bridges and roads - the emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasury of around two and a half million se@@ ster@@ ces .
but this treasury was depleted almost immediately after Anton@@ in@@ us &apos;s reign due to the plague brought back by soldiers after the Par@@ th@@ ian victory .
the Emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from cities affected by natural disasters , such as when fires struck Rome and Nar@@ bona , and earthquakes affected Rhodes and the Province of Asia .
he offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various Greek cities after two serious earthquakes : the first , &quot; cir@@ ca &quot; 140 , which affected mostly Rhodes and other islands ; the second , in 152 , which hit Cy@@ z@@ icus , Ep@@ he@@ sus , and S@@ myr@@ na .
Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; financial help earned him praise by Greek writers such as A@@ eli@@ us Aris@@ tides and P@@ aus@@ ani@@ as .
these cities received from Anton@@ in@@ us the usual honor@@ ific accol@@ ades , such as when he commanded that all governors of Asia should enter the province , when taking office , by way of Ep@@ he@@ sus .
Ep@@ he@@ sus was specially favoured by Anton@@ in@@ us , who confirmed and upheld its first place in the list of imperial honor titles , as opposed to S@@ myr@@ na and Per@@ gam@@ on .
in his dealings with Greek @-@ speaking cities , Anton@@ in@@ us followed the policy adopted by Had@@ rian of ingrati@@ ating himself with local elites , especially with local intellectuals : philosophers , teachers of literature , rhetor@@ icians and physicians were explicitly exempted from any duties involving private spending for civic purposes - a privilege granted by Had@@ rian that Anton@@ in@@ us confirmed by means of an edict preserved in the Digest .
Anton@@ in@@ us also created a chair for the teaching of rhetoric in Athens .
Anton@@ in@@ us was known as an avid observer of rites of religion and of formal celebrations - both Roman and foreign .
he is known for having increasingly formalized the official cult offered to the Great Mother , which from his reign onwards included a bull sacrifice , a ta@@ uro@@ bol@@ ium , formerly only a private ritual , now being also performed for the sake of the Emperor &apos;s welfare .
Anton@@ in@@ us also offered patronage to the worship of Mi@@ thr@@ as , to whom he erected a temple in O@@ sti@@ a .
in 148 , he presided over the celebrations of the 9@@ 00@@ th anniversary of the founding of Rome .
</p>
<p>
Anton@@ in@@ us tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the &quot; res publ@@ ica &quot; , no matter how extended and ill @-@ defined his competencies were .
he is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasury , the F@@ isc@@ us .
this splitting had to do with the division of imperial properties into two parts : firstly , the fisc@@ us itself - or &quot; patri@@ mon@@ ium &quot; , meaning the properties of the &quot; Crown , &quot; the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne , transmitted to his successors in office , regardless of their membership in the imperial family ; secondly , the &quot; res priv@@ ata &quot; , the &quot; private &quot; properties tied to the personal maintenance of the Emperor and his family .
an anecdote in the Hist@@ oria Augu@@ sta biography , where Anton@@ in@@ us replies to Faus@@ tina - who complained about his s@@ ting@@ iness - that &quot; we have gained an empire &#91; and &#93; lost even what we had before &quot; possibly relates to Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; actual concerns at the creation of the &quot; res priv@@ ata &quot; .
while still a private citizen , Anton@@ in@@ us had increased his personal fortune greatly by mean of various legacies , the consequence - we are told - of his caring scrupulously for his relatives .
the &quot; res priv@@ ata &quot; lands could be sold and / or given away , while the &quot; patri@@ mon@@ ium &quot; properties were regarded as public .
it was a way of pretending that the Imperial function - and most properties attached to it - was a public one , formally subject to the authority of the Senate and the Roman people .
that the distinction played no part in subsequent political history - that the &quot; personal &quot; power of the princ@@ eps absorbed his role as office @-@ holder - proves that the autocratic logic of the imperial order had already subsumed the old republican institutions .
of the public transactions of this period there is only the sc@@ anti@@ est of information , but , to judge by what is extant , those twenty @-@ two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after the reign .
however , Anton@@ in@@ us did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire .
one of his chief concerns was to having local communities conform their legal procedures to existing Roman norms : in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers in Asia Minor , Anton@@ in@@ us ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned , and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogations , to be used in the possibility of an appeal to the Roman governor .
also , although Anton@@ in@@ us was not an innov@@ ator , he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law ; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality , and introduced into Roman law many important new principles based upon this notion .
in this , the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers :
L. Ful@@ vi@@ us A@@ bur@@ nius Val@@ ens , an author of legal treati@@ ses ; L. Ul@@ pi@@ us Mar@@ cell@@ us , a prolific writer ; and three others .
these last three included L. V@@ olu@@ sius Ma@@ ec@@ i@@ anus , a former military officer turned by Anton@@ in@@ us into a civil procurator , and who , in view of his subsequent career , was the Emperor &apos;s most important legal adviser .
Ma@@ ec@@ i@@ anus would eventually be chosen to occupy various prefectures as well as to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us .
he was also the author of a large work on F@@ ide@@ i Comm@@ issa .
as a hallmark of the increased connection between jurists and the imperial government , Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; reign also saw the appearance of the &quot; Institutes of Gai@@ us &quot; , an elementary legal manual for beginners ( see Gai@@ us ) .
Anton@@ in@@ us passed measures to facilitate the en@@ franchis@@ ement of slaves .
mostly , he favoured the principle of &quot; favor liber@@ t@@ atis &quot; , giving the pu@@ tative freed@@ man the benefit of the doubt when the claim to freedom was not clear@@ cut .
also , he punished the killing of a slave by his / her master without previous trial and determined that slaves could be forcibly sold to another master by a pro@@ consul in cases of consistent mistreatment .
Anton@@ in@@ us upheld the enforcement of contracts for selling of female slaves forbidding their further employment in prostitution .
in criminal law , Anton@@ in@@ us introduced the important principle that accused persons are not to be treated as guilty before trial - as in the case of the ir@@ en@@ archs .
he also asserted the principle that the trial was to be held , and the punishment inflicted , in the place where the crime had been committed .
he mitigated the use of torture in examining slaves by certain limitations .
thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years , though this rule had exceptions .
however , it must be stressed that Anton@@ in@@ us &quot; extended &quot; , by means of a res@@ cript , the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases , when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases .
also , already at the time torture of free men of low status had become legal , as proved by the fact that Anton@@ in@@ us exempted town councillors expressly from it , and also free men of high rank in general .
one highlight during his reign occurred in 148 , with the nine @-@ hundredth anniversary of the foundation of Rome being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome .
it lasted a number of days , and a host of exotic animals were killed , including elephants , gira@@ ff@@ es , tigers , rhin@@ oc@@ ero@@ ses , cro@@ co@@ dil@@ es and hippo@@ potam@@ i .
while this increased Anton@@ in@@ us &apos;s popularity , the frugal emperor had to deb@@ ase the Roman currency .
he decreased the silver purity of the den@@ arius from 89 % to 8@@ 3.5 % - the actual silver weight dropping from 2.@@ 88 grams to 2.@@ 68 grams .
scholars name Anton@@ in@@ us Pi@@ us as the leading candidate for an individual identified as a friend of Rab@@ bi Judah the Prince .
according to the Tal@@ mud , Rab@@ bi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome .
he had a close friendship with &quot; Anton@@ in@@ us , &quot; possibly Anton@@ in@@ us Pi@@ us , who would consult Rab@@ bi Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters .

in 156 , Anton@@ in@@ us Pi@@ us turned 70 .
he found it difficult to keep himself upright without stays .
he started ni@@ bbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning recep@@ tions .
Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us had already been created consul with Anton@@ in@@ us in 140 , receiving the title of Caesar - i.e. , heir apparent .
as Anton@@ in@@ us aged , Marcus would take on more administrative duties , more still after the dea@@ thin 156 or 15@@ 7@@ of one of Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; most trusted advisers , G@@ avi@@ us Maxim@@ us , who had been pra@@ et@@ orian prefect for twenty years .
G@@ avi@@ us Maxim@@ us , who had been one of the most important members of Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; &quot; team &quot; of long standing advisers , had been awarded with the consular insignia and the honors due a senator .
he had developed a reputation as a most strict discipl@@ in@@ arian as well as some lasting grud@@ ges among fellow equ@@ estrian procurators - one of them , by predec@@ easing G@@ avi@@ us and vil@@ ifying him in his will , created a serious embarrassment to one of the heirs , the or@@ ator Fron@@ to .
G@@ avi@@ us Maxim@@ us &apos; death offered the opportunity to a welcome change in the ruling team , and it has been speculated that it was the legal adviser V@@ olu@@ sius Ma@@ ec@@ i@@ anus who - after a brief spell as Pra@@ ef@@ ect of Egypt , and a subsequent term as Pra@@ ef@@ ec@@ tus ann@@ on@@ ae in Rome - assumed the role of grey eminence precisely in order to prepare the incoming - and altogether new - joint succession .
in 160 , Marcus and Luci@@ us were designated joint consul@@ s for the following year .
perhaps Anton@@ in@@ us was already ill ; in any case , he died before the year was out .
two days before his death , the bi@@ ographer reports , Anton@@ in@@ us was at his ancestral estate at Lor@@ ium , in E@@ tru@@ ria , about twelve miles from Rome .
he ate Alpine Gru@@ y@@ ere cheese at dinner quite gre@@ ed@@ ily .
in the night he vom@@ ited ; he had a fever the next day .
the day after that , 7 March 161 , he summoned the imperial council , and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus .
the emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered : when the trib@@ une of the night @-@ watch came to ask the password , he responded , &quot; a@@ equ@@ anim@@ itas &quot; .
he then turned over , as if going to sleep , and died .
his death closed out the longest reign since August@@ us .
his record for the second @-@ longest reign would be un@@ beaten for 168 years , until 329 when it was surpassed by Constantine the Great .
Anton@@ in@@ us Pi@@ us &apos; funeral ceremonies were , in the words of the bi@@ ographer , &quot; elaborate . &quot; if his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals , his body would have been incin@@ erated on a py@@ re at the Campus Mar@@ tius , while his spirit would rise to the gods &apos; home in the heavens .
however , it seems that this was not the case : according to his Hist@@ oria Augu@@ sta biography Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; body was buried in Had@@ rian &apos;s ma@@ us@@ oleum .
after a seven @-@ day interval , Marcus and Luci@@ us nominated their father for de@@ ification .
in contrast to their behavior during Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; campaign to de@@ ify Had@@ rian , the senate did not oppose the emperors &apos; wishes .
a &quot; flam@@ en &quot; , or cul@@ tic priest , was appointed to minister the cult of the de@@ ified Anton@@ in@@ us , now &quot; Di@@ v@@ us Anton@@ in@@ us &quot; .
a column was dedicated to Anton@@ in@@ us on the Campus Mar@@ tius , and the temple he had built in the Forum in 141 to his de@@ ified wife Faus@@ tina was re@@ dedicated to the de@@ ified Faus@@ tina and the de@@ ified Anton@@ in@@ us .
it survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda .

the first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded in 166 AD by the &quot; Hou Han@@ shu &quot; .
the embassy came to Emperor Hu@@ an of Han China from &quot; An@@ dun &quot; , &quot; king of Da@@ qin &quot; .
as Anton@@ in@@ us Pi@@ us died in 161 , leaving the empire to his adoptive son Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us , and the envoy arrived in 166 , confusion remains about who sent the mission given that both Em@@ per@@ ors were named &apos; Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; .
the Roman mission came from the south , entering China by the frontier province of Ji@@ ao@@ zhi at R@@ inan or Ton@@ kin .
it brought presents of rhin@@ ocer@@ os horns , ivory , and tortoise shell , probably acquired in Southern Asia .
the text specifically states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries .
furthermore , a piece of Republican @-@ era Roman glass@@ ware has been found at a Western Han tomb in Guangzhou along the South China Sea , dated to the early 1st century BC .
Roman golden med@@ al@@ lions made during the reign of Anton@@ in@@ us Pi@@ us and perhaps even Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us have been found at Ó@@ c E@@ o in southern Vietnam , then part of the Kingdom of Fun@@ an near the Chinese province of Ji@@ ao@@ zhi .
this may have been the port city of Kat@@ ti@@ gara , described by P@@ tol@@ emy as being visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander and lying beyond the Golden Cher@@ son@@ ese .
Roman coins from the reigns of Ti@@ ber@@ ius to Au@@ reli@@ an have been discovered in Xi &apos;an , China , although the significantly greater amount of Roman coins unearthed in India suggest the Roman maritime trade for purchasing Chinese silk was centered there , not in China or even the overland Silk Road running through ancient Iran .

<p>
the only intact account of his life handed down to us is that of the &quot; Augu@@ stan History &quot; , an unreliable and mostly fabricated work .
nevertheless , it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound - for instance , it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Anton@@ ine Wall in Britain .
Anton@@ in@@ us is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other bi@@ ographies .
</p>
<p>
Anton@@ in@@ us in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans , but also by later scholars of classical history , such as Edward Gib@@ bon or the author of the article on Anton@@ in@@ us Pi@@ us in the &quot; En@@ cycl@@ op@@ æ@@ dia Brit@@ ann@@ ica &quot; Eleventh Edition .
a few months afterwards , on Had@@ rian &apos;s death , he was enthusiastically welcomed to the throne by the Roman people , who , for once , were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign .
for Anton@@ in@@ us came to his new office with simple tastes , kindly disposition , extensive experience , a well @-@ trained intelligence and the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects .
instead of plundering to support his prodig@@ ality , he emptied his private treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities , and everywhere exercised rigid economy .
instead of exagg@@ erating into treason whatever was susceptible of unfavorable interpretation , he turned the very conspir@@ acies that were formed against him into opportunities for demonstrating his clemency .
instead of stirring up persecution against the Christians , he extended to them the strong hand of his protection throughout the empire .
rather than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as inseparable from an emperor &apos;s progress through his dom@@ inions , he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome , or its neighbourhood .
some historians have a less positive view of his reign .
according to the historian J. B. Bur@@ y , however estimable the man , Anton@@ in@@ us was hardly a great statesman .
the rest which the Empire enjoyed under his auspices had been rendered possible through Had@@ rian &apos;s activity , and was not due to his own exer@@ tions ; on the other hand , he carried the policy of peace at any price too far , and so entailed calamities on the state after his death .
he not only had no originality or power of initiative , but he had not even the insight or boldness to work further on the new lines marked out by Had@@ rian .
German historian Ernst Kor@@ n@@ eman@@ n has had it in his &quot; R@@ ö@@ mis@@ che Ges@@ ch@@ ich@@ te &quot; &#91; 2 v@@ ols . , ed. by H. Beng@@ tson , St@@ utt@@ g@@ art 1954 &#93; that the reign of Anton@@ in@@ us comprised &quot; a succession of grossly wasted opportunities , &quot; given the upheavals that were to come .
there is more to this argument , given that the Par@@ thians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; passing .
Kor@@ n@@ eman@@ n &apos;s brief is that Anton@@ in@@ us might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders .
Michael Grant agrees that it is possible that had Anton@@ in@@ us acted decisively sooner , the Par@@ thians might have been unable to choose their own time , but current evidence is not conclusive .
grant op@@ ines that Anton@@ in@@ us and his officers did act in a resolute manner dealing with frontier disturbances of his time , although conditions for long @-@ lasting peace were not created .
on the whole , according to Grant , Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us &apos; eul@@ og@@ istic picture of Anton@@ in@@ us seems deserved , and Anton@@ in@@ us appears to have been a conservative and nationalistic Emperor who was not tainted by the blood of either citizen or foe , combined and maintained N@@ uma Pom@@ p@@ ili@@ us &apos; good fortune , pacific duti@@ fulness and religious scrup@@ ul@@ ousness , and whose laws removed anomalies and softened harsh@@ nesses .
Kr@@ z@@ ys@@ z@@ t@@ of U@@ lan@@ owski argues that the claims of military inability are exaggerated , considering that although the sources praise Anton@@ in@@ us &apos; love for peace and his efforts &quot; rather to defend , than enlarge the provinces , &quot; he could hardly be considered a pacif@@ ist , as shown by the conquest of the Low@@ lands , the building of the Anton@@ ine Wall and the expansion of Ger@@ mania Superior .
U@@ li@@ an@@ owski also praises Anton@@ in@@ us for being successful in deterrence by diplomatic means .
</p>
<p>
although only one of his four children survived to adulthood , Anton@@ in@@ us came to be ancestor to four generations of prominent Romans , including the Emperor Comm@@ o@@ dus .
Hans @-@ Ge@@ org P@@ fla@@ um has identified five direct descendants of Anton@@ in@@ us and Faus@@ tina who were consul@@ s in the first half of the third century . # Marcus Au@@ reli@@ us Ful@@ v@@ us Anton@@ in@@ us , died young without issue # Marcus Gal@@ er@@ ius Au@@ reli@@ us Anton@@ in@@ us , died young without issue # Au@@ reli@@ a Fad@@ illa , who married Luci@@ us Pla@@ uti@@ us Lam@@ ia Sil@@ van@@ us , su@@ ffec@@ t consul in 145 ; no children known for certain . # Faus@@ tina the Youn@@ ger , had several children ; those who had children were :

August@@ us was a Roman statesman and military leader who was the first Emperor of the Roman Empire , controlling Imperial Rome from 27 BC until his death in AD 14 .
his status as the founder of the Roman Princip@@ ate has consolidated an enduring legacy as one of the most effective and controversial leaders in human history .
the reign of August@@ us initiated an era of relative peace known as the &quot; Pax Romana &quot; .
the Roman world was largely free from large @-@ scale conflict for more than two centuries , despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire &apos;s frontiers and the year @-@ long civil war known as the &quot; Year of the Four Em@@ per@@ ors &quot; over the imperial succession .
August@@ us was born Gai@@ us Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us Th@@ urin@@ us into an old and wealthy equ@@ estrian branch of the ple@@ be@@ ian &quot; gens &quot; Oc@@ ta@@ via .
his maternal great @-@ uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC , and Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us was named in Caesar &apos;s will as his adopted son and heir .
along with Mark Anton@@ y and Marcus L@@ epi@@ dus , he formed the Second Tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate to defeat the assass@@ ins of Caesar .
following their victory at the Battle of Philipp@@ i , the Tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators .
the Tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members .
L@@ epi@@ dus was driven into exile and stripped of his position , and Anton@@ y committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Ac@@ tium by Oc@@ ta@@ vian in 31 BC .
after the demise of the Second Tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate , August@@ us restored the outward fa@@ ç@@ ade of the free Republic , with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate , the executive magistrates , and the legislative assemblies .
in reality , however , he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator .
by law , August@@ us held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate , including supreme military command , and those of trib@@ une and censor .
it took several years for August@@ us to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule .
he rejected mon@@ arch@@ ical titles , and instead called himself &quot; Princ@@ eps Civ@@ it@@ atis &quot; .
the resulting constitutional framework became known as the Princip@@ ate , the first phase of the Roman Empire .
August@@ us dramatically enlarged the Empire , annexing Egypt , Dal@@ mati@@ a , P@@ ann@@ onia , Nor@@ ic@@ um , and Ra@@ e@@ tia , expanding possessions in Africa , and completing the conquest of Hispan@@ ia , but suffered a major setback in Ger@@ mania .
beyond the frontiers , he secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the Par@@ th@@ ian Empire through diplomacy .
he reformed the Roman system of taxation , developed networks of roads with an official courier system , established a standing army , established the Pra@@ et@@ orian Guard , created official police and fire @-@ fighting services for Rome , and rebuilt much of the city during his reign .
August@@ us died in AD 14 at the age of 75 , probably from natural causes .
however , there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife Li@@ via poisoned him .
he was succeeded as emperor by his adopted son Ti@@ ber@@ ius .
</p>
<p>
while his paternal family was from the town of Vel@@ le@@ tri , approximately from Rome , August@@ us was born in the city of Rome on 23 September 63 BC .
he was born at O@@ x Head , a small property on the Pal@@ atine Hill , very close to the Roman Forum .
he was given the name Gai@@ us Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us Th@@ urin@@ us , his cogn@@ omen possibly commemorating his father &apos;s victory at Th@@ uri@@ i over a rebellious band of slaves .
Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us wrote : &quot; there are many indications that the Oc@@ ta@@ vian family was in days of old a distinguished one at Vel@@ it@@ ra@@ e ; for not only was a street in the most frequented part of town long ago called Oc@@ ta@@ vian , but an altar was shown there besides , consecrated by an Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us . this man was leader in a war with a neighbouring town ... &quot; Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time , Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us was taken to his father &apos;s home village at Vel@@ le@@ tri to be raised .
Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us only mentions his father &apos;s equ@@ estrian family briefly in his memoirs .
his paternal great @-@ grandfather Gai@@ us Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us was a military trib@@ une in Sicily during the Second Pun@@ ic War .
his grandfather had served in several local political offices .
his father , also named Gai@@ us Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us , had been governor of Macedonia .
his mother , A@@ tia , was the niece of Julius Caesar .
in 59 BC , when he was four years old , his father died .
his mother married a former governor of Syria , Luci@@ us Mar@@ ci@@ us Philip@@ pus .
Philip@@ pus claimed descent from Alexander the Great , and was elected consul in 56 BC .
Philip@@ pus never had much of an interest in young Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us .
because of this , Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us was raised by his grandmother , Julia , the sister of Julius Caesar .
Julia died in 52 or 51 BC , and Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother .
from this point , his mother and step@@ father took a more active role in raising him .
he donn@@ ed the &quot; to@@ ga vir@@ il@@ is &quot; four years later , and was elected to the College of Pon@@ ti@@ ffs in 47 BC .
the following year he was put in charge of the Greek games that were staged in honor of the Temple of Venus Gene@@ tri@@ x , built by Julius Caesar .
according to Nicol@@ aus of Damascus , Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us wished to join Caesar &apos;s staff for his campaign in Africa , but gave way when his mother protested .
in 46 BC , she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispan@@ ia , where he planned to fight the forces of Pom@@ pe@@ y , Caesar &apos;s late enemy , but Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us fell ill and was unable to travel .
when he had recovered , he sailed to the front , but was ship@@ wrecked ; after coming ashore with a handful of companions , he crossed hostile territory to Caesar &apos;s camp , which impressed his great @-@ uncle considerably .
Vel@@ le@@ ius Pater@@ cul@@ us reports that after that time , Caesar allowed the young man to share his carriage .
when back in Rome , Caesar deposited a new will with the V@@ est@@ al Virg@@ ins , naming Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us as the prime beneficiary .
</p>
<p>
Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us was studying and undergoing military training in Apol@@ lon@@ ia , Il@@ ly@@ ria , when Julius Caesar was killed on the I@@ des of March 44 BC .
he rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to Italy to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security .
Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law , and so had adopted Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us , his grand @-@ nephew , making him his primary heir .
Mark Anton@@ y later charged that Oc@@ ta@@ vian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours , though Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us describes Anton@@ y &apos;s accusation as political slander .
after landing at Lup@@ i@@ ae near Brun@@ di@@ sium , Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us learned the contents of Caesar &apos;s will , and only then did he decide to become Caesar &apos;s political heir as well as heir to two @-@ thirds of his estate .
upon his adoption , Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us assumed his great @-@ uncle &apos;s name Gai@@ us Julius Caesar .
Roman citizens adopted into a new family usually retained their old n@@ omen in cogn@@ omen form .
however , though some of his contemporaries did , there is no evidence that Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ us ever himself officially used the name &quot; Oc@@ ta@@ vi@@ anus &quot; , as it would have made his modest origins too obvious .
historians usually refer to the new Caesar as &quot; Oc@@ ta@@ vian &quot; during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name August@@ us in 27 BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir .
Oc@@ ta@@ vian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy .
after a warm welcome by Caesar &apos;s soldiers at Brun@@ di@@ sium , Oc@@ ta@@ vian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against the Par@@ th@@ ian Empire in the Middle East .
this amounted to 700 million se@@ ster@@ ces stored at Brun@@ di@@ sium , the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east .
a later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds took no action against Oc@@ ta@@ vian , since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate &apos;s arch enemy Mark Anton@@ y .
Oc@@ ta@@ vian made another bold move in 44 BC when , without official permission , he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Rome &apos;s Near Eastern province to Italy .
Oc@@ ta@@ vian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesar &apos;s veteran leg@@ ion@@ aries and with troops designated for the Par@@ th@@ ian war , gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar .
on his march to Rome through Italy , Oc@@ ta@@ vian &apos;s presence and newly acquired funds attracted many , winning over Caesar &apos;s former veterans stationed in Cam@@ pan@@ ia .
by June , he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans , paying each a salary of 500 den@@ ari@@ i .
</p>
<p>
arriving in Rome on 6 May 44 BC , Oc@@ ta@@ vian found consul Mark Anton@@ y , Caesar &apos;s former colleague , in an uneasy truce with the dictator &apos;s assass@@ ins .
they had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March , yet Anton@@ y had succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome with an inflammatory eul@@ ogy at Caesar &apos;s funeral , mounting public opinion against the assass@@ ins .
Mark Anton@@ y was am@@ assing political support , but Oc@@ ta@@ vian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar .
Mark Anton@@ y had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status .
Oc@@ ta@@ vian failed to persuade Anton@@ y to relinquish Caesar &apos;s money to him .
during the summer , he managed to win support from Caes@@ arian sympathizers and also made common with the Optim@@ ates , the former enemies of Caesar , who saw him as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him .
in September , the leading Op@@ timate or@@ ator Marcus Tul@@ li@@ us Cic@@ ero began to attack Anton@@ y in a series of speeches portraying him as a threat to the Republican order .
</p>
<p>
with opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end , Anton@@ y attempted to pass laws that would assign him the province of C@@ is@@ alpine G@@ aul .
Oc@@ ta@@ vian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caes@@ arian veterans and , on 28 November , he won over two of Anton@@ y &apos;s leg@@ ions with the entic@@ ing offer of monetary gain .
in the face of Oc@@ ta@@ vian &apos;s large and capable force , Anton@@ y saw the danger of staying in Rome and , to the relief of the Senate , he left Rome for C@@ is@@ alpine G@@ aul , which was to be handed to him on 1 January .
however , the province had earlier been assigned to Dec@@ im@@ us Juni@@ us Bru@@ tus Al@@ bin@@ us , one of Caesar &apos;s assass@@ ins , who now refused to yield to Anton@@ y .
Anton@@ y besieged him at Mu@@ tina and rejected the resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the fighting .
the Senate had no army to enforce their resolutions .
this provided an opportunity for Oc@@ ta@@ vian , who already was known to have armed forces .
Cic@@ ero also defended Oc@@ ta@@ vian against Anton@@ y &apos;s ta@@ unts about Oc@@ ta@@ vian &apos;s lack of noble lineage and aping of Julius Caesar &apos;s name , stating &quot; we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth . &quot; at the urging of Cic@@ ero , the Senate induc@@ ted Oc@@ ta@@ vian as senator on 1 January 43 BC , yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consul@@ s .
in addition , Oc@@ ta@@ vian was granted &quot; prop@@ ra@@ e@@ tor &quot; &quot; imperi@@ um &quot; which legalized his command of troops , sending him to relieve the siege along with Hir@@ tius and P@@ ansa .
in April 43 BC , Anton@@ y &apos;s forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gall@@ orum and Mu@@ tina , forcing Anton@@ y to retreat to Trans@@ alpine G@@ aul .
both consul@@ s were killed , however , leaving Oc@@ ta@@ vian in sole command of their armies .
the senate heaped many more rewards on Dec@@ im@@ us Bru@@ tus than on Oc@@ ta@@ vian for defeating Anton@@ y , then attempted to give command of the consular leg@@ ions to Dec@@ im@@ us Bru@@ tus .
in response , Oc@@ ta@@ vian stayed in the Po Valley and refused to aid any further offensive against Anton@@ y .
in July , an embassy of centu@@ ri@@ ons sent by Oc@@ ta@@ vian entered Rome and demanded the consul@@ ship left vacant by Hir@@ tius and P@@ ansa and also that the decree should be rescinded which declared Anton@@ y a public enemy .
when this was refused , he marched on the city with eight leg@@ ions .
he encountered no military opposition in Rome , and on 19 August 43 BC was elected consul with his relative Quin@@ tus Pedi@@ us as co @-@ consul .
meanwhile , Anton@@ y formed an alliance with Marcus A@@ em@@ ili@@ us L@@ epi@@ dus , another leading Caes@@ arian .
</p>
<p>
in a meeting near Bologna in October 43 BC , Oc@@ ta@@ vian , Anton@@ y , and L@@ epi@@ dus formed the Second Tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate .
this explicit ar@@ rogation of special powers lasting five years was then leg@@ alised by law passed by the ple@@ bs , unlike the unofficial First Tri@@ um@@ vi@@ rate formed by Pom@@ pe@@ y , Julius Caesar , and Marcus Lic@@ ini@@ us C@@ ras@@ sus .
the trium@@ vir@@ s then set in motion proscri@@ ptions , in which between 130 and 300 senators and 2,000 &quot; equ@@ ites &quot; were branded as outlaws and deprived of their property and , for those who failed to escape , their lives .
rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed , while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the trium@@ vir@@ s .
contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which trium@@ vir was most responsible for the proscri@@ ptions and killing .
