the new line @-@ up wrote and rehear@@ sed throughout 1984 , and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ez@@ rin in October .
unhappy with the results , the band parted ways with Don@@ ato shortly after .
disillusioned with the band &apos;s revolving line @-@ up , Ge@@ e@@ zer Butler quit Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band .
&quot; when Ian Gill@@ an took over that was the end of it for me , &quot; he said .
while working on new material , the original Sabbath line @-@ up agreed to a spot at Bob G@@ eld@@ of &apos;s Live Aid , performing at the Philadelphia show on 13 July 1985 .
this event - which also featured reunions of The Who and L@@ ed Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ in - marked the first time the original line @-@ up had appeared on stage since 1978 .
&quot; we were all drunk when we did Live Aid , &quot; recalled Ge@@ e@@ zer Butler , &quot; but we &apos;d all got drunk separately . &quot; returning to his solo work , I@@ om@@ mi enlisted b@@ assist Dave Sp@@ itz , drummer Eric Singer and initially intended to use multiple singers , including Rob Hal@@ ford of Judas Pri@@ est , former Deep Purple and Tra@@ pe@@ ze voc@@ alist Glenn Hughes , and former Sabbath voc@@ alist R@@ onnie James Di@@ o .
this plan didn &apos;t work as he forecasted .
&quot; we were going to use different voc@@ alists on the album , guest voc@@ alists , but it was so difficult getting it together and getting releases from their record companies . Glenn Hughes came along to sing on one track and we decided to use him on the whole album . &quot; the band spent the remainder of the year in the studio , recording what would become &quot; Seventh Star &quot; .
Warner Bro@@ s. refused to release the album as a Tony I@@ om@@ mi solo release , instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath .
pressured by the band &apos;s manager , Don Ar@@ den , the two compromised and released the album as &quot; Black Sabbath featuring Tony I@@ om@@ mi &quot; in January 1986 .
&quot; it opened up a whole can of worms , &quot; I@@ om@@ mi explained .
&quot; if we could have done it as a solo album , it would have been accepted a lot more . &quot; &quot; seventh Star &quot; sounded little like a Sabbath album , incorporating instead elements popul@@ ar@@ ised by the 1980s Sun@@ set Strip hard rock scene .
it was p@@ anned by the critics of the era , although later reviewers such as All@@ Music gave album verdicts , calling the album &quot; often misunderstood and under@@ rated . &quot; the new line @-@ up rehear@@ sed for six weeks preparing for a full world tour , although the band were eventually forced to use the Sabbath name .
&quot; I was into the &apos; Tony I@@ om@@ mi project &apos; , but I wasn &apos;t into the Black Sabbath mon@@ i@@ ker , &quot; Hughes said .
&quot; the idea of being in Black Sabbath didn &apos;t appeal to me &quot; whatsoever &quot; . Glenn Hughes singing in Black Sabbath is like James Brown singing in Met@@ al@@ lica . it wasn &apos;t gonna work . &quot; just four days before the start of the tour , Hughes got into a bar fight with the band &apos;s production manager John Downing which spl@@ intered the singer &apos;s orbital bone .
the injury interfered with Hughes &apos; ability to sing , and the band brought in voc@@ alist Ray Gill@@ en to continue the tour with W.@@ A.@@ S.@@ P. and Anth@@ ra@@ x , although nearly half of the U.S. dates would be cancelled because of poor ticket sales .
one voc@@ alist whose status is disputed , both inside and outside Sabbath , is Christian evangel@@ ist and former Joshua front@@ man Jeff Fen@@ hol@@ t .
Fen@@ hol@@ t insists he was a singer in Sabbath between January and May 1985 .
I@@ om@@ mi has never confirmed this .
Fen@@ hol@@ t gives a detailed account in Gar@@ ry Shar@@ pe @-@ Young &apos;s book &quot; Sabbath B@@ loo@@ dy Sabbath : the Battle for Black Sabbath &quot; .

black Sabbath began work on new material in October 1986 at Air Stu@@ di@@ os in Montserrat with producer Jeff G@@ li@@ x@@ man .
the recording was fraught with problems from the beginning , as G@@ li@@ x@@ man left after the initial sessions to be replaced by producer V@@ ic Cop@@ pers@@ mi@@ th @-@ Heaven .
b@@ assist Dave Sp@@ itz quit over &quot; personal issues , &quot; and former Rainbow and O@@ zzy Os@@ bourne b@@ assist Bob Da@@ is@@ ley was brought in .
Da@@ is@@ ley re @-@ recorded all of the bass tracks , and wrote the album &apos;s lyrics , but before the album was complete , he left to join Gary Moore &apos;s backing band , taking drummer Eric Singer with him .
after problems with second producer Cop@@ pers@@ mi@@ th @-@ Heaven , the band returned to Morgan Stu@@ di@@ os in England in January 1987 to work with new producer Chris Ts@@ ang@@ ari@@ des .
while working in the United Kingdom , new voc@@ alist Ray Gill@@ en abruptly left Black Sabbath to form Blue Mur@@ der with guit@@ arist John Sy@@ kes .
the band enlisted heavy metal voc@@ alist Tony Martin to re @-@ record Gill@@ en &apos;s tracks , and former Electric Light Orchestra drummer B@@ ev B@@ evan to complete a few percussion over@@ du@@ bs .
before the release of the new album Black Sabbath accepted an offer to play six shows at Sun City , South Africa during the apartheid era .
the band drew criticism from activists and artists involved with Artists United Against Apartheid , who had been boycot@@ ting South Africa since 1985 .
drummer B@@ ev B@@ evan refused to play the shows , and was replaced by Terry Chim@@ es , formerly of the Cl@@ ash .
after nearly a year in production , &quot; The E@@ ternal Idol &quot; was released on 8 December 1987 and ignored by contemporary reviewers .
on @-@ line internet era reviews were mixed .
All@@ Music said that &quot; Martin &apos;s powerful voice added new fire &quot; to the band , and the album contained &quot; some of I@@ om@@ mi &apos;s heaviest ri@@ ffs in years . &quot; &quot; bl@@ ender &quot; gave the album two stars , claiming the album was &quot; Black Sabbath in name only . &quot; the album would stall at No. 66 in the United Kingdom , while peaking at 168 in the U.S. The band toured in support of &quot; E@@ ternal Idol &quot; in Germany , Italy and for the first time , Greece .
in part due to a backlash from promoters over the South Africa incident , other European shows were cancelled .
b@@ assist Dave Sp@@ itz left the band shortly before the tour , and was replaced by Jo Bur@@ t , formerly of Virginia Wolf .
following the poor commercial performance of &quot; The E@@ ternal Idol &quot; , Black Sabbath were dropped by both Ver@@ ti@@ go Records and Warner Bro@@ s. Records , and signed with I.@@ R.@@ S. Records .
the band took time off in 1988 , returning in August to begin work on their next album .
as a result of the recording troubles with &quot; E@@ ternal Idol &quot; , Tony I@@ om@@ mi opted to produce the band &apos;s next album himself .
&quot; it was a completely new start , &quot; I@@ om@@ mi said .
the unsuccessful &quot; Head@@ less Cross &quot; U.S. tour began in May 1989 with open@@ ers Kingdom Come and Silent R@@ age , but because of poor ticket sales , the tour was cancelled after just eight shows .
the European leg of the tour began in September , where the band were enjoying chart success .
after a string of Japanese shows the band embarked on a 23 date Russian tour with Gir@@ l@@ school .
black Sabbath was one of the first bands to tour Russia , after Mikhail Gorbachev opened the country to western acts for the first time in 1989 .
the band returned to the studio in February 1990 to record &quot; Ty@@ r &quot; , the follow @-@ up to &quot; Head@@ less Cross &quot; .
while not technically a concept album , some of the album &apos;s ly@@ rical themes are loosely based on Nor@@ se mythology . &quot;
for the first time in their career , the band &apos;s touring cycle did not include U.S. dates .
</p>
<p>
while on his &quot; Lock Up the Wol@@ ves &quot; U.S. tour in August 1990 , former Sabbath voc@@ alist R@@ onnie James Di@@ o was joined on@@ stage at the Roy Wil@@ kins Auditorium by Ge@@ e@@ zer Butler to perform &quot; Ne@@ on K@@ nights . &quot; following the show , the two expressed interest in re@@ joining Sabbath .
Butler convinced I@@ om@@ mi , who in turn broke up the current lineup , dismissing voc@@ alist Tony Martin and b@@ assist Neil Murray .
&quot; I do regret that in a lot of ways , &quot; I@@ om@@ mi said .
&quot; we were at a good point then . we decided to &#91; reunite with Di@@ o &#93; and I don &apos;t even know why , really . there &apos;s the financial aspect , but that wasn &apos;t it . I seemed to think maybe we could recapture something we had . &quot; Di@@ o and Butler joined I@@ om@@ mi and Co@@ zy Powell in autumn 1990 to begin the next Sabbath release .
while rehear@@ sing in November , Powell suffered a broken hip when his horse died and fell on the drummer &apos;s legs .
unable to complete the album , Powell was replaced by former drummer Vin@@ ny App@@ ice , re@@ uniting the &quot; M@@ ob Rules &quot; lineup , and the band entered the studio with producer Rein@@ hold Mack .
the year @-@ long recording was plagued with problems , primarily stemming from writing tension between I@@ om@@ mi and Di@@ o .
songs were rewritten multiple times .
&quot; it was just hard work , &quot; I@@ om@@ mi said .
&quot; we took too long on it , that album cost us a million dollars , which is bloody ridiculous . &quot; Di@@ o recalled the album as difficult , but worth the effort :
&quot; it was something we had to really wring out of ourselves , but I think that &apos;s why it works . sometimes you need that kind of tension , or else you end up making the Christmas album . &quot; the resulting &quot; De@@ human@@ izer &quot; was released on 22 June 1992 .
in the U.S. , the album was released on 30 June 1992 by Rep@@ rise Records , as Di@@ o and his names@@ ake band were still under contract to the label at the time .
while the album received mixed , it was the band &apos;s biggest commercial success in a decade .
anchored by the top 40 rock radio single &quot; TV Crimes , &quot; the album peaked at number 44 on the &quot; Bill@@ board 200 . &quot; the album also featured &quot; Time Machine , &quot; a version of which had been recorded for the 1992 film &quot; Wayne &apos;s World &quot; .
additionally , the perception among fans of a return of some semblance of the &quot; real &quot; Sabbath provided the band with much needed momentum .
Sabbath began touring in support of &quot; De@@ human@@ izer &quot; in July 1992 with Testament , D@@ anz@@ ig , Pr@@ ong , and Ex@@ o@@ dus .
while on tour , former voc@@ alist O@@ zzy Os@@ bourne announced his first retirement , and invited Sabbath to open for his solo band at the final two shows of his &quot; No More T@@ ours &quot; tour in Costa M@@ esa , California .
the band agreed , aside from Di@@ o , who told I@@ om@@ mi , &quot; I &apos;m not doing that . I &apos;m not supporting a clown . &quot; Di@@ o spoke of the situation years later :
I was told in the middle of the tour that we would be opening for O@@ zzy in Los Angeles .
and I said , &quot; No . sorry , I have more pride than that . &quot; a lot of bad things were being said from camp to camp , and it created this horrible sch@@ ism .
so by &#91; the band &#93; agreeing to play the shows in L.@@ A. with O@@ zzy , that , to me , spelled out reunion .
and that obviously meant the doom of that particular project .
Di@@ o quit Sabbath following a show in Oak@@ land , California on 13 November 1992 , one night before the band were set to appear at Os@@ bourne &apos;s retirement show .
Judas Pri@@ est voc@@ alist Rob Hal@@ ford stepped in at the last minute , performing two nights with the band .
I@@ om@@ mi and Butler joined Os@@ bourne and former drummer Ward on stage for the first time since 1985 &apos;s Live Aid concert , performing a brief set of Sabbath songs .
this set the stage for a longer @-@ term reunion of the original lineup , though that plan proved short @-@ lived .
&quot; O@@ zzy , Ge@@ e@@ zer , Tony and Bill announced the reunion of Black Sabbath - again , &quot; remarked Di@@ o .
&quot; and I thought that it was a great idea . but I guess O@@ zzy didn &apos;t think it was such a great idea ... I &apos;m never surprised when it comes to whatever happens with them . never at all . they are very predictable . they don &apos;t talk . &quot;
</p>
<p>
drummer Vin@@ ny App@@ ice left the band following the reunion show to join R@@ onnie James Di@@ o &apos;s solo band , later appearing on Di@@ o &apos;s &quot; S@@ tran@@ ge High@@ ways &quot; and &quot; An@@ gry Machines &quot; .
I@@ om@@ mi and Butler enlisted former Rainbow drummer Bobby Ron@@ din@@ elli , and reinstated former voc@@ alist Tony Martin .
the band returned to the studio to work on new material , although the project was not originally intended to be released under the Black Sabbath name .
as Ge@@ e@@ zer Butler explains : it wasn &apos;t even supposed to be a Sabbath album ;
I wouldn &apos;t have even done it under the pretence of Sabbath .
that was the time when the original band were talking about getting back together for a reunion tour .
Tony and myself just went in with a couple of people , did an album just to have , while the reunion tour was going on .
it was like an I@@ om@@ mi / Butler project album .
under pressure from their record label , the band released their seventeenth studio album , &quot; Cross Purposes &quot; , on 8 February 1994 , under the Black Sabbath name .
the album received mixed reviews , with &quot; Bl@@ ender &quot; giving the album two stars , calling S@@ ound@@ garden &apos;s 1994 album &quot; Super@@ unknown &quot; &quot; a far better Sabbath album than this by @-@ the @-@ numbers pot@@ boiler . &quot; All@@ Music &apos;s Bradley Tor@@ re@@ ano called &quot; Cross Purposes &quot; &quot; the first album since &quot; Born Again &quot; that actually sounds like a real Sabbath record . &quot; the album just missed the Top 40 in the UK reaching number 41 , and also reached 122 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; 200 in the U.S. &quot;
cross Purposes &quot; contained the song &quot; Evil Eye , &quot; which was co @-@ written by Van Hal@@ en guit@@ arist Eddie Van Hal@@ en , although un@@ credited because of record label restrictions .
touring in support of &quot; Cross Purposes &quot; began in February with Mor@@ bid Angel and Mot@@ ör@@ head in the U.S. The band filmed a live performance at the Ham@@ mer@@ smith Apollo on 13 April 1994 , which was released on V@@ HS accompanied by a CD , titled &quot; Cross Purposes Live &quot; .
after the European tour with Cathedral and God@@ speed in June 1994 , drummer Bobby Ron@@ din@@ elli quit the band and was replaced by original Black Sabbath drummer Ward for five shows in South America .
following the touring cycle for &quot; Cross Purposes &quot; , b@@ assist Ge@@ e@@ zer Butler quit the band for the second time .
&quot; I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album , and I much preferred the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing . &quot; Butler formed a solo project called G@@ Z@@ R , and released &quot; Plastic Planet &quot; in 1995 .
the album contained the song &quot; Giving Up the Ghost , &quot; which was critical of Tony I@@ om@@ mi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name , with the lyrics :
&quot; you plagi@@ ar@@ ised and paro@@ died / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can &apos;t admit that you &apos;re wrong / the spirit is dead and gone &quot; ( &quot; I heard it &apos;s something about me ... &quot; said I@@ om@@ mi .
&quot; I had the album given to me a while back . I played it once , then somebody else had it , so I haven &apos;t really paid any attention to the lyrics ... It &apos;s nice to see him doing his own thing - getting things off his chest . I don &apos;t want to get into a rift with Ge@@ e@@ zer . he &apos;s still a friend . &quot; following Butler &apos;s departure , newly returned drummer Ward once again left the band .
I@@ om@@ mi reinstated former members Neil Murray on bass and Co@@ zy Powell on drums , effectively re@@ uniting the 1990 &quot; Ty@@ r &quot; line @-@ up .
the band enlisted Body Count guit@@ arist Er@@ nie C to produce the new album , which was recorded in London in autumn of 1994 .
the album featured a guest vocal on &quot; Il@@ lusion of Power &quot; by Body Count voc@@ alist Ice @-@ T .
the resulting &quot; Forbidden &quot; was released on 8 June 1995 , but failed to chart in the U.S. The album was widely p@@ anned by critics ;
All@@ Music &apos;s Bradley Tor@@ re@@ ano said &quot; with boring songs , awful production , and un@@ inspired performances , this is easily avoidable for all but the most enthusiastic fan &quot; ; while &quot; Bl@@ ender &quot; magazine called &quot; Forbidden &quot; &quot; an embarrassment ... the band &apos;s worst album . &quot; black Sabbath embarked on a world tour in July 1995 with open@@ ers Mot@@ ör@@ head and Ti@@ am@@ at , but two months into the tour , drummer Co@@ zy Powell left the band , citing health issues , and was replaced by former drummer Bobby Ron@@ din@@ elli .
&quot; the members I had in the last lineup - Bobby Ron@@ din@@ elli , Neil Murray - they &apos;re great , great characters ... &quot; I@@ om@@ mi told Sabbath f@@ anz@@ ine &quot; Southern Cross &quot; .
&quot; that , for me , was an ideal lineup . I wasn &apos;t sure voc@@ ally what we should do , but Neil Murray and Bobby Ron@@ din@@ elli I really got on well with . &quot; after completing Asian dates in December 1995 , Tony I@@ om@@ mi put the band on hiatus , and began work on a solo album with former Black Sabbath voc@@ alist Glenn Hughes , and former Judas Pri@@ est drummer Dave Holland .
the album was not officially released following its completion , although a widely traded boot@@ leg called &quot; Eighth Star &quot; surfaced soon after .
the album was officially released in 2004 as &quot; The 1996 D@@ EP Sessions &quot; , with Holland &apos;s drums re @-@ recorded by session drummer Jimmy Co@@ ple@@ y .
in 1997 , Tony I@@ om@@ mi disbanded the current line @-@ up to officially reunite with O@@ zzy Os@@ bourne and the original Black Sabbath line @-@ up .
voc@@ alist Tony Martin claimed that an original line @-@ up reunion had been in the works since the band &apos;s brief reunion at O@@ zzy Os@@ bourne &apos;s 1992 Costa M@@ esa show , and that the band released subsequent albums to fulfill their record contract with I.@@ R.@@ S. Records .
Martin later recalled &quot; Forbidden &quot; as a &quot; filler album that got the band out of the label deal , rid of the singer , and into the reunion . however I wasn &apos;t priv@@ y to that information at the time . &quot; I.@@ R.@@ S. Records released a compilation album in 1996 to fulfill the band &apos;s contract , titled &quot; The Sabbath St@@ ones &quot; , which featured songs from &quot; Born Again &quot; to &quot; Forbidden &quot; .
</p>
<p>
in the summer of 1997 , I@@ om@@ mi , Butler and Os@@ bourne reunited to co@@ headline the O@@ zz@@ f@@ est tour alongside Os@@ bourne &apos;s solo band .
the line @-@ up featured Os@@ bourne &apos;s drummer Mike B@@ ord@@ in filling in for Ward .
the album reached number eleven on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; 200 , went platinum in the U.S. and spawned the single &quot; Iron Man , &quot; which won Sabbath their first Gram@@ my Award in 2000 for Best Metal Performance , 30 years after the song was originally released . &quot;
reunion &quot; featured two new studio tracks , &quot; Psych@@ o Man &quot; and &quot; Selling My Soul , &quot; both of which cracked the top 20 of the &quot; Bill@@ board Main@@ stream Rock T@@ racks &quot; chart .
shortly before a European tour in the summer of 1998 , Ward suffered a heart attack and was temporarily replaced by former drummer Vin@@ ny App@@ ice .
Ward returned for a U.S. tour with open@@ ers Pan@@ tera , which began in January 1999 and continued through the summer , head@@ lining the annual O@@ zz@@ f@@ est tour .
following these appearances , the band was put on hiatus while members worked on solo material .
I@@ om@@ mi released his first official solo album , &quot; I@@ om@@ mi &quot; , in 2000 , while Os@@ bourne continued work on &quot; Down to Earth &quot; .
Sabbath returned to the studio to work on new material with all four original members and producer Rick Rub@@ in in the spring of 2001 , but the sessions were halted when Os@@ bourne was called away to finish tracks for his solo album in the summer .
&quot; it just came to an end ... &quot; I@@ om@@ mi said .
</p>
<p>
while O@@ zzy Os@@ bourne was working on new solo album material in 2006 , Rhin@@ o Records released &quot; &quot; , a compilation of songs cul@@ led from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring R@@ onnie James Di@@ o .
for the release , I@@ om@@ mi , Butler , Di@@ o , and App@@ ice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath . &quot;
the Di@@ o Years &quot; was released on 3 April 2007 , reaching number 54 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; 200 , while the single &quot; The Devil Cri@@ ed &quot; reached number 37 on the &quot; Main@@ stream Rock T@@ racks &quot; chart .
pleased with the results , I@@ om@@ mi and Di@@ o decided to reunite the Di@@ o era line @-@ up for a world tour .
while the line @-@ up of Os@@ bourne , Butler , I@@ om@@ mi , and Ward was still officially called Black Sabbath , the new line @-@ up opted to call themselves Heaven &amp; Hell , after the album of the same title , to avoid confusion .
heaven &amp; Hell toured the U.S. with open@@ ers Meg@@ ad@@ eth and Machine Head , and recorded a live album and DVD in New York on 30 March 2007 , titled &quot; Live from Radio City Music Hall &quot; .
in November 2007 , Di@@ o confirmed that the band had plans to record a new studio album , which was recorded in the following year .
in April 2008 the band announced the upcoming release of a new box set and their participation in the Metal Masters Tour , alongside Judas Pri@@ est , Mot@@ ör@@ head and Testament .
the box set , &quot; The Rules of Hell &quot; , featuring rema@@ stered versions of all the Di@@ o fron@@ ted Black Sabbath albums , was supported by the Metal Masters Tour .
in 2009 , the band announced the title of their debut studio album , &quot; The Devil You Know &quot; , released on 28 April .
on 26 May 2009 , Os@@ bourne filed suit in a federal court in New York against I@@ om@@ mi alleging that he illegally claimed the band name .
I@@ om@@ mi noted that he has been the only constant band member for its full 41 @-@ year career and that his band@@ mates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s , therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band .
although in the suit , Os@@ bourne was seeking 50 % ownership of the trademark , he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members .
in March 2010 , Black Sabbath announced that along with Met@@ al@@ lica they would be releasing a limited edition single together to celebrate Record Store Day .
it was released on 17 April 2010 .
R@@ onnie James Di@@ o died on 16 May 2010 from stomach cancer .
in June 2010 , the legal battle between O@@ zzy Os@@ bourne and Tony I@@ om@@ mi over the trademar@@ king of the Black Sabbath name ended , but the terms of the settlement have not been disclosed .
</p>
<p>
in a January 2010 interview while promoting his biography &quot; I Am O@@ zzy &quot; , Os@@ bourne stated that although he would not rule it out , he was doubtful there would be a reunion with all four original members of the band .
Os@@ bourne stated : &quot; I &apos;m not gonna say I &apos;ve written it out forever , but right now I don &apos;t think there &apos;s any chance . but who knows what the future holds for me ? if it &apos;s my destiny , fine . &quot; in July , Butler said that there would be no reunion in 2011 , as Os@@ bourne was already committed to touring with his solo band .
however , by that August they had already met up to rehearse together , and continued to do so through the autumn .
on 11 November 2011 , I@@ om@@ mi , Butler , Os@@ bourne , and Ward announced that they were re@@ uniting to record a new album with a full tour in support beginning in 2012 .
guit@@ arist I@@ om@@ mi was diagnosed with lymphoma on 9 January 2012 , which forced the band to cancel all but two shows of a previously booked European tour .
it was later announced that an intimate show would be played in their hometown Birmingham .
it was the first concert since the reunion and the only indoors concerts that year .
in February 2012 , drummer Ward announced that he would not participate further in the band &apos;s reunion until he was offered a &quot; sign@@ able contract . &quot; on 21 May 2012 , at the O2 Academy in Birmingham , Black Sabbath played their first concert since 2005 , with Tommy Clu@@ fe@@ tos playing the drums .
in June , they performed at Download Festival at Don@@ ington Park in Le@@ ic@@ ester@@ shire , England , followed by the last concert of the short tour at L@@ ol@@ lap@@ al@@ oo@@ za Festival in Chicago .
later that month , the band started recording an album .
on 13 January 2013 , the band announced that the album would be released in June under the title &quot; 13 &quot; .
Brad Wil@@ k of R@@ age Against the Machine was chosen as the drummer , and Rick Rub@@ in was chosen as the producer .
mixing of the album commenced in February .
on 12 April 2013 , the band released the album &apos;s track listing .
the standard version of the album features eight new tracks , and the deluxe version features three bonus tracks .
the band &apos;s first single from &quot; 13 &quot; , &quot; God Is Dead ? , &quot; was released on 19 April 2013 .
on 20 April 2013 , Black Sabbath commenced their first Australia / New Zealand tour in 40 years , to be followed by a major North American Tour in Summer 2013 .
the second single of the album , &quot; End of the Beg@@ inning , &quot; debu@@ ted on 15 May in a &quot; &quot; episode , where all three members appeared .
in June 2013 , &quot; 13 &quot; topped both the UK Alb@@ ums Chart and the U.S. &quot;
&quot; God Is Dead ? &quot; earned Black Sabbath their first Gram@@ my Award in 14 years for Best Metal Performance in 2014 .
in July 2013 , Black Sabbath embarked on a North American Tour , followed by a Latin American tour in October 2013 .
in November 2013 , the band started their European tour which lasted until December 2013 .
in March and April 2014 , they made 12 stops in North America as the second leg of their North American Tour before embarking in June 2014 on the second leg of their European tour , which ended with a concert at London &apos;s Hyde Park .

<p>
on 29 September 2014 , Os@@ bourne told &quot; Metal Ham@@ mer &quot; that Black Sabbath would begin work on their twentieth studio album in early 2015 with producer Rick Rub@@ in , followed by a final tour in 2016 .
in an April 2015 interview , however , Os@@ bourne said that these plans &quot; could change , &quot; and added , &quot; We all live in different countries and some of them want to work and some of them don &apos;t want to , I believe . but we are going to do another tour together . &quot; on 3 September 2015 , it was announced that Black Sabbath would embark on their final tour , titled The End , from January 2016 to February 2017 .
numerous dates and locations across the U.S. , Canada , Europe , Australia and New Zealand were announced .
the final shows of The End tour took place at the Gen@@ ting Ar@@ ena in their home city of Birmingham , England on 2 and 4 February 2017 .
on 26 October 2015 , it was announced the band consisting of Os@@ bourne , I@@ om@@ mi and Butler would be returning to the Download Festival on 11 June 2016 .
despite earlier reports that they would enter the studio before their farewell tour , Os@@ bourne stated that there would not be another Black Sabbath studio album .
however , an 8 @-@ track CD entitled &quot; The End &quot; was sold at dates on the tour .
along with some live recordings , the CD includes four unused tracks from the &quot; 13 &quot; sessions .
on 4 March 2016 , I@@ om@@ mi discussed future re @-@ releases of the Tony Martin @-@ era catalogue .
he explained : &quot; we &apos;ve held back on the re@@ issues of those albums because of the current Sabbath thing with O@@ zzy Os@@ bourne , but they will certainly be happening ... I &apos;d like to do a couple of new tracks for those releases with Tony Martin ... I &apos;ll also be looking at working on &quot; Cross Purposes &quot; and &quot; Forbidden &quot; . &quot; Martin has suggested that this could coincide with the 30th anniversary of &quot; The E@@ ternal Idol &quot; , in 2017 .
in an interview that August , Martin added &quot; &#91; I@@ om@@ mi &#93; still has his cancer issues of course and that may well stop it all from happening but if he wants to do something I am ready . &quot; on 10 August 2016 , I@@ om@@ mi revealed that his cancer was in remission .
asked in November 2016 about his plans after Black Sabbath &apos;s final tour , I@@ om@@ mi replied , &quot; I &apos;ll be doing some writing . maybe I &apos;ll be doing something with the guys , maybe in the studio , but no touring . &quot; the band played their final concert on 4 February 2017 in Birmingham .
the final song was streamed live on the band &apos;s Facebook page and fireworks went off as the band took their final bow .
in a June 2018 interview with IT@@ V News , Os@@ bourne stated that he would like to reunite with Black Sabbath for a performance at the 2022 Commonwealth Games which is due to be held in their home city Birmingham .
I@@ om@@ mi added , &quot; I think that it would be a great thing to do to help represent Birmingham . I &apos;m up for it . let &apos;s see what happens . &quot;

black Sabbath were a heavy metal band , whose music has also been described as psych@@ ed@@ elic rock , and acid rock .
the band have also been cited as a key influence on genres including st@@ oner rock , grun@@ ge , doom metal , and sludge metal .
early on Black Sabbath were influenced by Cre@@ am , the Beatles , Fle@@ e@@ tw@@ ood Mac , Jim@@ i Hend@@ ri@@ x , John May@@ all &amp; the Blu@@ es@@ breakers , L@@ ed Z@@ ep@@ pel@@ in , and J@@ eth@@ ro T@@ ull .
although Black Sabbath went through many line @-@ ups and stylistic changes , their core sound focuses on ominous lyrics and do@@ omy music , often making use of the musical tr@@ it@@ one , also called the &quot; devil &apos;s interval . &quot; while their O@@ zzy @-@ era albums such as &quot; Sabbath B@@ loo@@ dy Sabbath &quot; had slight com@@ positional similarities to the progressive rock genre that was growing in popularity at the time , standing in stark contrast to popular music of the early 1970s Black Sabbath &apos;s dark sound was dismissed by rock critics of the era .
much like many of their early heavy metal contemporaries , the band received virtually no air@@ play on rock radio .
as the band &apos;s primary song@@ writer , Tony I@@ om@@ mi wrote the majority of Black Sabbath &apos;s music , while Os@@ bourne would write vocal melodies , and b@@ assist Ge@@ e@@ zer Butler would write lyrics .
the process was sometimes frustrating for I@@ om@@ mi , who often felt pressured to come up with new material :
&quot; if I didn &apos;t come up with anything , nobody would do anything . &quot; on I@@ om@@ mi &apos;s influence , Os@@ bourne later said :
black Sabbath never used to write a structured song .
there &apos;d be a long intr@@ o that would go into a jazz piece , then go all fol@@ ky ... and it worked .
Tony I@@ om@@ mi - and I have said this a z@@ il@@ lion times - should be up there with the great@@ s .
he can pick up a guitar , play a ri@@ ff , and you say , &apos; He &apos;s gotta be out now , he can &apos;t top that . &apos;
then you come back , and I bet you a billion dollars , he &apos;d come up with a ri@@ ff that &apos;d knock your fucking socks off .
beginning with their third album , &quot; Master of Reality &quot; , Black Sabbath began to feature tuned @-@ down guit@@ ars .
in 1965 , before forming Black Sabbath , guit@@ arist Tony I@@ om@@ mi suffered an accident while working in a sheet metal factory , losing the tips of two fingers on his right hand .
I@@ om@@ mi almost gave up music , but was urged by the factory manager to listen to Dj@@ ango Rein@@ hardt , a jazz guit@@ arist who lost the use of two fingers in a fire .
inspired by Rein@@ hardt , I@@ om@@ mi created two thim@@ bles made of plastic and leather to cap off his missing fingertips .
the guit@@ arist began using lighter strings , and de@@ tuning his guitar , to better grip the strings with his prosthesis .
early in the band &apos;s history I@@ om@@ mi experimented with different dropped tun@@ ings , including C tuning , or 3 sem@@ it@@ ones down , before settling on E / D tuning , or a half @-@ step down from standard tuning .

<p>
black Sabbath has sold over 70 million records worldwide , including a R@@ IAA @-@ certified 15 million in the U.S. They are one of the most influential heavy metal bands of all time .
the band helped to create the genre with ground @-@ breaking releases such as &quot; Par@@ ano@@ id &quot; , an album that &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; magazine said &quot; changed music forever , &quot; and called the band &quot; the Beatles of heavy metal . &quot; &quot; time Magazine &quot; called &quot; Par@@ ano@@ id &quot; &quot; the birthplace of heavy metal , &quot; placing it in their Top 100 Alb@@ ums of All Time . &quot;
although initially &quot; despised by rock critics and ignored by radio programmers , &quot; the group sold more than 8 million albums by the end of that decade .

<p>
black Sabbath have influenced many acts including Iron Ma@@ iden , S@@ layer , Met@@ al@@ lica , Nir@@ vana , Kor@@ n , May@@ hem , Ven@@ om , Judas Pri@@ est , Gun@@ s N &apos; Ro@@ ses , S@@ ound@@ garden , Body Count , Alice in Cha@@ ins , Anth@@ ra@@ x , Di@@ stur@@ bed , Death , O@@ pe@@ th , Pan@@ tera , Meg@@ ad@@ eth , the Sm@@ ashing Pum@@ p@@ kins , S@@ lip@@ knot , Fo@@ o Figh@@ ters , Fear Factory , Cand@@ lem@@ ass , God@@ smack , and Van Hal@@ en .
two gold selling tribute albums have been released , &quot; N@@ ativity in Black Volume 1 &amp; 2 &quot; , including covers by Sep@@ ul@@ tura , White Z@@ om@@ bie , Type O Negative , Faith No More , Machine Head , Pri@@ mus , System of a Down , and Mon@@ ster Mag@@ net .
Met@@ al@@ lica &apos;s Lars Ul@@ rich , who , along with band@@ mate James H@@ et@@ field induc@@ ted Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of F@@ ame in 2006 , said &quot; Black Sabbath is and always will be synonymous with heavy metal , &quot; while H@@ et@@ field said &quot; Sabbath got me started on all that evil @-@ sounding shit , and it &apos;s stuck with me . Tony I@@ om@@ mi is the king of the heavy ri@@ ff . &quot; former Gun@@ s N &apos; Ro@@ ses guit@@ arist Sl@@ ash said of the &quot; Par@@ ano@@ id &quot; album :
&quot; if anybody who plays heavy metal says that they weren &apos;t influenced by Black Sabbath &apos;s music , then I think that they &apos;re lying to you . I think all heavy metal music was , in some way , influenced by what Black Sabbath did . &quot; Judas Pri@@ est voc@@ alist Rob Hal@@ ford commented :
&quot; they were and still are a groundbreaking band .. you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30 @-@ odd years ago . and that &apos;s because great music has a timeless ability : to me , Sabbath are in the same league as the Beatles or Mozart . they &apos;re on the leading edge of something extraordinary . &quot; on Black Sabbath &apos;s standing , R@@ age Against the Machine guit@@ arist Tom Mor@@ ello states :
King Diamond guit@@ arist Andy La@@ Roc@@ que affirmed that the clean guitar part of &quot; Sle@@ e@@ pless Ni@@ ghts &quot; from &quot; Con@@ spir@@ acy &quot; is inspired by Tony I@@ om@@ mi &apos;s playing on &quot; Never Say Die ! &quot; .
in addition to being pioneers of heavy metal , they also have been credited for laying the foundations for heavy metal sub@@ genres st@@ oner rock , sludge metal , th@@ rash metal , black metal and doom metal as well as for alternative rock sub@@ genre grun@@ ge .
according to the critic Bob Gul@@ la , the band &apos;s sound &quot; shows up in virtually all of grun@@ ge &apos;s most popular bands , including Nir@@ vana , S@@ ound@@ garden , and Alice in Cha@@ ins . &quot; Tony I@@ om@@ mi has been credited as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings .
the tips of his fingers were severed in a steel factory , and while using thim@@ bles he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play .
he found that there was only one size of strings available , so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made .
culturally , Black Sabbath have exerted a huge influence in both television and literature and have in many cases become synonymous with heavy metal .
in the film &quot; Almost Fam@@ ous &quot; , Lester Ban@@ gs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band with the immortal line : &apos; give me 500 words on Black Sabbath &apos; .
contemporary music and arts publication &quot; Tre@@ bu@@ chet Magazine &quot; has put this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece on Black Sabbath as a means of proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject .

Arthur &quot; Blind &quot; Blake was an American blues and rag@@ time singer and guit@@ arist .
he is known for numerous recordings he made for Par@@ amount Records between 1926 and 1932 .
</p>
<p>
little is known of Blake &apos;s life .
promotional materials from Par@@ amount Records indicate he was born blind and give his birthplace as Jack@@ son@@ ville , Florida , and it seems that he lived there during various periods .
he seems to have had relatives in Patterson , Georgia .
some authors have written that in one recording he slipped into a Ge@@ ec@@ hee or Gul@@ lah dialect , suggesting a connection with the Sea Islands .
blind Willie Mc@@ Tell indicated that Blake &apos;s real name was Arthur Phelps , but later research has shown this is unlikely to be correct .
in 2011 a group of researchers led by Alex van der Tu@@ uk published various documents regarding Blake &apos;s life and death in the journal &quot; Blu@@ es &amp; R@@ hy@@ th@@ m &quot; .
one of these documents is his 1934 death certificate , which states he was born in 1896 in New@@ port News , Virginia , to Winter and Alice Blake .
nothing else is known of Blake until the 1920s , when he emerged as a recording musician .
</p>
<p>
Blake recorded about 80 tracks for Par@@ amount Records from 1926 to 1932 .
he was one of the most accomplished guit@@ ari@@ sts of his genre and played a diverse range of material .
he is best known for his distinctive guitar playing , which was comparable in sound and style to rag@@ time piano .
he seems to have lived in Jack@@ son@@ ville and to have gone to Chicago for his recording sessions , at one point having an apartment at 31st Street and Cot@@ tage Gro@@ ve Avenue .
according to van der Tu@@ uk et al . , he apparently returned to Florida for the winter .
in the 1930s he was reported to be playing in front of a Jack@@ son@@ ville hotel .
</p>
<p>
Blake married Beat@@ rice Mc@@ Gee around 1931 .
in the following year he made his final recording at the Par@@ amount headquarters , in Gra@@ f@@ ton , Wisconsin , just before the label went out of business .
for decades nothing was known of him after this point , and it was rum@@ ored that he met with a violent death ;
Reverend Gary Davis heard he had been hit by a street@@ car in 1934 .
the research of van der Tu@@ uk et al. suggests that Blake stayed in Wisconsin , living in Milwaukee &apos;s Bre@@ wer &apos;s Hill neighborhood , where Par@@ amount boarded many of its artists .
he seems not to have found work as a musician .
in April 1933 he was hospitalized with pneumonia and never fully recovered .
on December 1 , 1934 , after three weeks of decline , Beat@@ rice Blake summoned an ambulance .
he suffered a pulmonary hemorrhage and died on the way to the hospital .
the cause of death was listed as pulmonary tuberculosis .
he was buried in Glen O@@ aks Cemetery , in Gl@@ end@@ ale , Wisconsin .
</p>
<p>
Blake &apos;s first recordings were made in 1926 , and his records sold well .
his first solo record was &quot; Early Morning Blu@@ es , &quot; with &quot; West Coast Blu@@ es &quot; on the B @-@ side .
both are considered excellent examples of his rag@@ time @-@ based guitar style and were prototypes for the burgeoning Pi@@ ed@@ mont blues .
Blake made his last recordings in 1932 ; his career ended with Par@@ amount &apos;s bankruptcy .
Stefan Grossman and Gay@@ le Dean W@@ ard@@ low have suggested it is possible that only one side of Blake &apos;s last record is actually by him ;
&quot; champagne Charlie Is My Name &quot; does not sound like Blake &apos;s playing or singing .
his complex and intricate finger@@ picking inspired Reverend Gary Davis , Jor@@ ma Kau@@ kon@@ en , R@@ y Coo@@ der , Ar@@ len Roth , John Fa@@ hey , Ralph Mc@@ Tell , Leon Red@@ bone and many others .
the title track of Bob D@@ ylan &apos;s 1992 album &quot; Good As I Been to You &quot; is a cover of Blind Blake &apos;s &quot; You G@@ onna Qu@@ it Me Blu@@ es . &quot; the French singer @-@ song@@ writer Francis Cab@@ rel refers to Blake in the song &quot; C@@ ent An@@ s de Plus , &quot; on the 1999 album &quot; H@@ ors @-@ Sa@@ ison . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Blake figures in the plot of Lee Child &apos;s 1997 Jack Re@@ acher novel , &quot; K@@ illing Floor &quot; , and there are references to him in Child &apos;s 2011 pre@@ qu@@ el , &quot; The Aff@@ air &quot; .

</p>
<p>
Brian was one of his eleven siblings .
his father Bun@@ ty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cy@@ rus enrolled him in the local Harvard Co@@ aching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays .
as a result , Lara had a very early education in correct bat@@ ting technique .
Lara &apos;s first school was St. Joseph &apos;s Roman Catholic primary .
he then went to San Juan Secondary School , which is located on Mor@@ eau Road , Lower Santa Cruz .
a year later , at fourteen years old , he moved on to Fatima College where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Mr. Harry Ram@@ d@@ ass .
aged 14 , he amassed 745 runs in the school@@ boys &apos; league , with an average of 126.@@ 16 per in@@ nings , which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under @-@ 16 team .
when he was 15 years old , he played in his first West Indian under @-@ 19 youth tournament and that same year , Lara represented West Indies in Under @-@ 19 cricket .
</p>
<p>
1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara , when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by Carl Ho@@ oper set the previous year .
he cap@@ tained the tournament @-@ winning Trinidad and Tobago , who profited from a match @-@ winning 116 from Lara .

later in the same year , he cap@@ tained the West Indies team in Australia for the Bic@@ ent@@ ennial Youth World Cup where the West Indies reached the semi @-@ finals .
later that year , his in@@ nings of 182 as captain of the West Indies Under @-@ 23@@ s against the touring Indian team further elevated his reputation .
his first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course , but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team .
in 1989 , he cap@@ tained a West Indies B Team in Zimbabwe and scored 145 .
in 1990 , at the age of 20 , Lara became Trinidad and Tobago &apos;s youngest @-@ ever captain , leading them that season to victory in the one @-@ day Ged@@ des Grant Shield .

he had made his OD@@ I debut a month earlier against Pakistan , scoring 11 .
</p>
<p>
in January 1993 , Lara scored 277 versus Australia in Sydney .
this , his maiden Test century in his fifth Test , was the turning point of the series as West Indies won the final two Tests to win the series 2 @-@ 1 .

he hit 308 in boundaries .
his partners were Roger Tw@@ ose , Trevor Pen@@ ney , Paul Smith and Keith Pi@@ per .
earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven in@@ nings while playing for War@@ w@@ ick@@ shire .
he is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score , having scored 375 against England in 1994 , a record that stood until Matthew Hay@@ den &apos;s 380 against Zimbabwe in 2003 .
his 400 not out also made him the second player to score two Test triple @-@ centuries , and the second to score two first @-@ class quadruple @-@ centuries .
he has scored nine double centuries in Test cricket , third after Brad@@ man &apos;s twelve and Kumar Sang@@ ak@@ kara &apos;s eleven .
as a captain , he scored five double centuries , which is the highest by any one who is in charge .

that same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries , and one fifty - including the double century and a century in the first and second in@@ nings of the 3rd Test Match at the Sin@@ hal@@ ese Sports Ground , equ@@ ating to 42 % of the team &apos;s runs in that series .
these extraordinary performances led Mut@@ ti@@ ah Mur@@ ali@@ thar@@ an to state that Lara was the most dangerous bat@@ sman he had ever bow@@ led to .
Lara was reappointed as captain against the touring Australians in 2003 , and struck 110 in his first Test match back in charge , showing a return to stellar performance .
later that season , under his cap@@ tain@@ cy , West Indies won the two match Test series against Sri Lanka 1 @-@ 0 with Lara making a double century in the First Test .
in September 2004 , West Indies won the ICC Champions Tro@@ phy in England under his cap@@ tain@@ cy .
in March 2005 , Lara declined selection for the West Indies team because of a dispute over his personal Cable &amp; Wireless sponsorship deal , which clashed with the C@@ ric@@ ket Board &apos;s main sponsor , Dig@@ ic@@ el .
six other players were involved in this dispute , including stars Chris Gay@@ le , Ram@@ na@@ resh Sar@@ wan and D@@ way@@ ne Bravo .
Lara said he declined selection in a stand of solidarity , when these players were dropped because of their sponsorship deals .
the issue was resolved after the first Test of the series against the touring South African team .
Lara returned to the team for the second Test , but in the process lost his cap@@ tain@@ cy indefinitely to the newly appointed Shi@@ v@@ nar@@ ine Chan@@ der@@ p@@ aul .
in the next Test , against the same opponents , he scored a 176 in the first in@@ nings .

this followed the resignation of Shi@@ v@@ nar@@ ine Chan@@ der@@ p@@ aul , who had been captain for thirteen months - in which the West Indies won just one of the 14 Test matches they had competed .
in May 2006 , Lara led the West Indies to successful One @-@ Day series victories against Zimbabwe and India .
Lara &apos;s team played Australia in the finals of the D@@ LF Cup and the ICC Champions Tro@@ phy where they finished runners up in both finals .

<p>
before Bon@@ ds made it to the major leagues in Pittsburgh , Pir@@ ate fan attendance was low , with 1984 and 1985 attendance below 10,000 per game for the 81 @-@ game home schedule .
bonds made his major league debut on May 30 , 1986 .

he played center field in 1986 , but switched to left field with the arrival of center@@ fielder Andy Van S@@ ly@@ ke in 1987 .
in his early years , Bon@@ ds bat@@ ted as the lead@@ off h@@ itter .
with Van S@@ ly@@ ke also in the out@@ field , the Pir@@ ates had a venerable defensive tandem that worked together to cover a lot of ground on the field although they were not close off the field .
the Pir@@ ates experienced a surge in fan enthusiasm with Bon@@ ds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,@@ 119 in the 1987 home opener .
that year , he hit 25 home runs in his second season , along with 32 stolen bases and 59 RB@@ Is .

in 1991 , Bon@@ ds also put up great numbers , hitting 25 hom@@ ers and driving in 116 runs , and obtained another Gold G@@ love and Silver S@@ lu@@ gger .
</p>
<p>
in 1993 , Bon@@ ds left the Pir@@ ates to sign a lucrative free agent contract worth a then @-@ record $ 43.@@ 75 million over six years with the Gi@@ ants , with whom his father had spent the first seven years of his career , and with whom his god@@ father Willie Mays played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons .
the deal was at that time the largest in baseball history , in terms of both total value and average annual salary .
once he signed with the Gi@@ ants , Bon@@ ds had intended to wear 24 , his number during most of his stay with the Pir@@ ates , and after receiving Mays &apos;s blessing the Gi@@ ants were willing to un@@ retire it until the public commotion from fans and media became too much .
to honor his father , Bon@@ ds switched his jersey number to 25 , as it had been Bobby &apos;s number in San Francisco .
bonds hit .@@ 336 in 1993 , leading the league with 46 home runs and 123 RB@@ I en route to his second consecutive M@@ VP award , and third overall .
as good as the Gi@@ ants were , the Atlanta Bra@@ ves won 104 in what some call the last great pen@@ nant race .
</p>

</p>
<p>
in 1996 , Bon@@ ds became the first National League player and second major league player to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season .
the other members of the 40 @-@ 40 club are José Can@@ sec@@ o @-@ 1988 , Alex Rodriguez @-@ 1998 , and Alfonso S@@ ori@@ ano @-@ 2006 ; his father Bobby Bon@@ ds was one home run short in 1973 when he hit 39 home runs and stole 43 bases .
bonds hit his 30@@ 0th and 30@@ 1st home runs off the Florida Mar@@ lins &apos; John Bur@@ kett on April 27 .

<p>
with two outs in the 9th inning of a game against the Arizona Diam@@ ond@@ backs on May 28 , 1998 , Bon@@ ds became only the fifth player in baseball history to be given an intentional walk with the bases loaded .
NAP La@@ jo@@ ie , Del Biss@@ on@@ ette and Bill Nichol@@ son were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor .
the first to receive one was Abner Dal@@ r@@ ym@@ ple in 18@@ 81 .

on August 23 , Bon@@ ds hit his 400@@ th career home run .
by doing so , he became the first player ever to enter the 400 @-@ 400 club by having career totals of 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases ; he is still the only player to have achieved this feat .
the milestone home run came off Kir@@ t Oj@@ ala , who , like Bur@@ kett , was pitching for the Mar@@ lins .
for the season , he hit .@@ 303 with 37 home runs and drove in 122 runs , winning his eighth Gold G@@ love , He finished 8th in the M@@ VP voting .

<p>
1999 marked a career low up to that point for Bon@@ ds in terms of playing time .
but on April 18 he was placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list for only the 2nd time in his career up to that point .
bonds had suffered a torn tendon in his bic@@ ep as well as bone spurs in his elbow , both of which required surgery and cost him the rest of April and all of May .
upon returning to action on June 9 , Bon@@ ds struggled somewhat at the plate for the remainder of the 1999 season .
a series of nagging injuries including elbow pain , knee inflammation and gro@@ in issues hampered his play .
only hitting .@@ 248 after his return from the disabled list , he still managed to slug 34 home runs , drive in 83 runs as well as hit for a .@@ 617 slu@@ gging percentage , despite missing nearly two full months with injuries and only playing in 102 games .
Bill James ranked Bon@@ ds as the best player of the 1990s .
he added that the decade &apos;s second @-@ best player , Craig Big@@ gio , had been closer in production to the decade &apos;s 10th @-@ best player than to Bon@@ ds .
in 1999 , with statistics through 1997 being considered , Bon@@ ds ranked Number 34 on The S@@ porting News &apos; list of the 100 Great@@ est Bas@@ eball P@@ layers , making him the highest @-@ ranking active player .
when the S@@ porting News list was re@@ done in 2005 , Bon@@ ds was ranked 6th behind Ba@@ be Ruth , Willie Mays , T@@ y Cob@@ b , Walter Johnson , and Hank Aaron .
bonds was omitted from 1999 &apos;s Major League Bas@@ eball All @-@ Century Team , to which Ken Griff@@ ey , J@@ r. was elected .
James wrote of Bon@@ ds , &quot; Certain@@ ly the most un@@ appreciated superstar of my lifetime . ... Griff@@ ey has always been more popular , but Bon@@ ds has been a far , far greater player . &quot; in 1999 , he rated Bon@@ ds as the 16th @-@ best player of all time .
&quot; when people begin to take in all of his accomplishments , &quot; he predicted , &quot; Bon@@ ds may well be rated among the five greatest players in the history of the game . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in 2000 , the following year , Bon@@ ds hit .@@ 306 with career be@@ sts through that time in both slu@@ gging percentage and home runs in just 143 games .
he also drew a league @-@ leading 117 walks .
</p>
<p>
the next year , Bon@@ ds &apos;s offensive production reached even higher levels , breaking not only his own personal records but several major league records .
in the Gi@@ ants &apos; first 50 games in 2001 , he hit 28 home runs , including 17 in May - a career high .

on October 4 , Bon@@ ds tied the previous record of 70 set by Mark Mc@@ G@@ wire - which Mc@@ G@@ wire set in the 16@@ 2nd game in 1998 - by hom@@ ering off Wil@@ fre@@ do Rodríguez in the 15@@ 9th game of the season .
he then hit numbers 71 and 72 the following night off Chan Ho Park .

on July 4 , he tied and passed Ric@@ key Henderson &apos;s career bases on balls record with his 2@@ 19@@ 0th and 2@@ 19@@ 1st career walks .
as Bon@@ ds neared Aaron &apos;s record , Aaron was called on for his opinion of Bon@@ ds .
he clarified that he was a fan and admirer of Bon@@ ds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be den@@ oted with an asterisk for Bon@@ ds &apos;s alleged steroid usage .
he felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans .
as the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the off@@ season before the 2005 season , Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bon@@ ds made on the issue .
Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate .
Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less .
in 2007 , Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record @-@ breaking games .
Aaron congratulated Bon@@ ds through the media including a video played on the scor@@ eboard when Bon@@ ds eventually broke Aaron &apos;s record in August 2007 .
</p>

upon his return , Bon@@ ds resumed his high @-@ caliber performance at the plate , hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18 to 21 and finishing with five hom@@ ers in only 14 games .
</p>
<p>
in 2006 , Bon@@ ds earned $ 20 million , the fourth highest salary in baseball .
through the 2006 season he had earned approximately $ 172 million during his then 21 @-@ year career , making him baseball &apos;s all @-@ time highest paid player .
bonds hit under .@@ 200 for his first 10 games of the season and did not hit a home run until April 22 .
this 10 @-@ game stretch was his longest home run slump since the 1998 season .
on May 7 , Bon@@ ds drew within one home run of tying Ba@@ be Ruth for second place on the all @-@ time list , hitting his 7@@ 13th career home run into the second level of Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia , off pitcher Jon Lie@@ ber in a game in which the Gi@@ ants lost to the Philadelphia Phil@@ lies .
the towering home run - one of the longest in Citizens Bank Park &apos;s two @-@ season history , traveling an estimated 450 feet - hit off the facade of the third deck in right field .
on May 20 , Bon@@ ds tied Ruth , hitting his 7@@ 14th career home run to deep right field to lead off the top of the 2nd inning .
the home run came off left @-@ handed pitcher Brad Hal@@ sey of the Oak@@ land A &apos;s , in an inter@@ league game played in Oak@@ land , California .
since this was an inter@@ league game at an American League stadium , Bon@@ ds was bat@@ ting as the designated h@@ itter in the lineup for the Gi@@ ants .
bonds was quoted after the game as being &quot; glad it &apos;s over with &quot; and stated that more attention could be focused on Albert Pu@@ j@@ ols , who was on a very rapid home run pace in early 2006 .
on May 28 , Bon@@ ds passed Ruth , hitting his 7@@ 15th career home run to center field off Colorado Rock@@ ies pitcher By@@ ung @-@ hy@@ un Kim .
the ball was hit an estimated 445 feet into center field where it went through the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field .
then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Mor@@ bit@@ zer , a 38 @-@ year @-@ old San Francisco resident , caught the ball while he was in line at a concession stand .
mysteriously , radio broadcaster Dave Flem@@ ming &apos;s radio play @-@ by @-@ play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit , apparently from a microphone failure .
but the televised version , called by Gi@@ ants broadcaster Du@@ ane Ku@@ i@@ per , was not affected .
on September 22 , Bon@@ ds tied Henry Aaron &apos;s National League career home run record of 733 .
the home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high @-@ scoring game against the Milwaukee Bre@@ wers , at Miller Park in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
the achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began and concluded his career .
with the Gi@@ ants trailing 10 @-@ 8 , Bon@@ ds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2 @-@ 0 pitch off the Bre@@ wers &apos; Chris Spur@@ ling with runners on first and second and one out .
though the Gi@@ ants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the play@@ offs , Bon@@ ds &apos;s home run provided the additional drama of giving the Gi@@ ants an 11 @-@ 10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pen@@ nant race .
the Bre@@ wers eventually won the game , 13 @-@ 12 , though Bon@@ ds went 3 for 5 , with 2 doubles , the record @-@ tying home run , and 6 runs bat@@ ted in .
on September 23 , Bon@@ ds surpassed Aaron for the NL career home run record .
hit in Milwaukee like the previous one , this was a solo home run off Chris Cap@@ u@@ ano of the Bre@@ wers .
this was the last home run Bon@@ ds hit in 2006 .
in 2006 , Bon@@ ds recorded his lowest slu@@ gging percentage since 1991 with the Pittsburgh Pir@@ ates .
in January 2007 , the &quot; New York Daily News &quot; reported that Bon@@ ds had tested positive for amphetamines .
under baseball &apos;s amphetamine policy , which had been in effect for one season , players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling .
the policy also stated that players were not to be identified for a first positive test , but the &quot; New York Daily News &quot; leaked the test &apos;s results .
when the P@@ layers Association informed Bon@@ ds of the test results , he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Gi@@ ants teammate Mark Swe@@ en@@ ey , but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Swe@@ en@@ ey .
</p>
<p>
on January 29 , 2007 , the Gi@@ ants finalized a contract with Bon@@ ds for the 2007 season .
after the commissioner &apos;s office rejected Bon@@ ds &apos;s one @-@ year , $ 15.8 million deal because it contained a personal @-@ appearance provision , the team sent revised documents to his agent , Jeff Bor@@ ris , who stated that &quot; At this time , Barry is not signing the new documents . &quot; bonds signed a revised one @-@ year , $ 15.8 million contract on February 15 and reported to the Gi@@ ants &apos; Spring training camp on time .
bonds resumed his march to the all @-@ time record early in the 2007 season .
after an opening game in which all he had was a first @-@ inning single past third base against a right @-@ shifted in@@ field and a deep out to left field late in the game , Bon@@ ds returned the next day , April 4 , with another mission .
in his first at @-@ bat of the season &apos;s second game at the Gi@@ ants &apos; AT &amp; T Park , Bon@@ ds hit a Chris Young pitch just over the wall to the left of straigh@@ ta@@ way center field for career home run 735 .
this home run put Bon@@ ds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron .
bonds did not hom@@ er again until April 13 , when he hit two in a 3 for 3 night that included 4 RB@@ I against the Pittsburgh Pir@@ ates .
bonds splashed a pitch by St. Louis Car@@ din@@ als pitcher Ryan Franklin into Mc@@ C@@ ov@@ ey Co@@ ve on April 18 for home run 738 .
home runs number 739 and 740 came in back to back games on April 21 and 22 against the Arizona Diam@@ ond@@ backs .
the hype surrounding Bon@@ ds &apos;s pursuit of the home run record escalated on May 14 .
on this day , Sports Au@@ ction for Heritage offered US $ 1 million to the fan who would catch Bon@@ ds &apos;s record @-@ breaking 75@@ 6th @-@ career home run .
the million dollar offer was rescinded on June 11 out of concern of fan safety .
home run 748 came on Father &apos;s Day , June 17 , in the final game of a 3 @-@ game road series against the Boston Red So@@ x at Fen@@ way Park , where Bon@@ ds had never previously played .
with this hom@@ er , Fen@@ way Park became the 36th major league ball@@ park in which Bon@@ ds had hit a home run .
he hit a Tim Wa@@ ke@@ field knuck@@ le@@ ball just over the low fence into the Giant &apos;s bull@@ pen in right field .
it was his first home run off his former Pittsburgh Pir@@ ate teammate , who became the 44@@ 1st different pitcher to surrender a four @-@ bag@@ ger to Bon@@ ds .
the 7@@ 50th career home run , hit on June 29 , also came off a former teammate : Liv@@ án Hernández .
the blast came in the 8th inning and at that point tied the game at 3 @-@ 3 .
on July 19 , after a 21 at @-@ bat hit@@ less streak , Bon@@ ds hit 2 home runs , numbers 752 and 753 , against the Chicago Cub@@ s .
he went 3 @-@ 3 with 2 home runs , 6 RB@@ Is , and a walk on that day .
the struggling last place Gi@@ ants still lost the game , 9 @-@ 8 .
on July 27 , Bon@@ ds hit home run 754 against Florida Mar@@ lins pitcher Rick V@@ and@@ en@@ Hur@@ k .
bonds was then walked his next 4 at @-@ bats in the game , but a 2 @-@ run shot helped the Gi@@ ants win the game 12 @-@ 10 .
it marked the first time since he had hit # 747 that Bon@@ ds had hom@@ ered in a game the Gi@@ ants won .
on August 4 , Bon@@ ds hit a 382 foot home run against Clay H@@ ens@@ ley of the San Diego Pad@@ res for home run number 755 , tying Hank Aaron &apos;s all @-@ time record .
bonds greeted his son , Nikol@@ ai , with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate .
bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife , Liz Watson , and daughter A@@ isha Lynn behind the backstop .
H@@ ens@@ ley was the 44@@ 5th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bon@@ ds .
ironically , given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bon@@ ds , the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use .
he was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder &apos;s choice .
on August 7 at 8 : 51 PM PD@@ T , at Oracle Park in San Francisco , Bon@@ ds hit a 435 foot home run , his 75@@ 6th , off a pitch from Mike Bac@@ si@@ k of the Washington Nationals , breaking the all @-@ time career home run record , formerly held by Hank Aaron .
co@@ incidentally , Bac@@ si@@ k &apos;s father had faced Aaron after Aaron had hit his 75@@ 5th home run .
on August 23 , 1976 , Michael J. Bac@@ si@@ k held Aaron to a single and a fly out to right field .
the younger Bac@@ si@@ k commented later , &quot; If my dad had been gracious enough to let Hank Aaron hit a home run , we both would have given up 756 . &quot; after hitting the home run , Bon@@ ds gave Bac@@ si@@ k an auto@@ graph@@ ed bat .
the pitch , the seventh of the at @-@ bat , was a 3 @-@ 2 pitch which Bon@@ ds hit into the right @-@ center field ble@@ achers .
the fan who ended up with the ball , 22 @-@ year @-@ old Matt Murphy from Queens , New York , was promptly protected and escorted away from the mayhem by a group of San Francisco police officers .
after Bon@@ ds finished his home run trot , a ten @-@ minute delay followed , including a brief video by Aaron congratulating Bon@@ ds on breaking the record Aaron had held for 33 years , and expressing the hope that &quot; the achievement of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams . &quot; bonds made an im@@ promp@@ tu emotional statement on the field , with Willie Mays , his god@@ father , at his side and thanked his teammates , family and his late father .
bonds sat out the rest of the game .
the commissioner , Bu@@ d S@@ eli@@ g , was not in attendance in this game but was represented by the Executive Vice President of Bas@@ eball Operations , Jim@@ mie Lee Solomon .
S@@ eli@@ g called Bon@@ ds later that night to congratulate him on breaking the record .
President George W. Bush also called Bon@@ ds the next day to congratulate him .
on August 24 , San Francisco honored and celebrated Bon@@ ds &apos;s career accomplishments and breaking the home run record with a large rally in Justin Herman Plaza .
the rally included video messages from Lou Bro@@ ck , Er@@ nie Banks , O@@ zz@@ ie Smith , Joe Montana , Wayne Gret@@ z@@ ky and Michael Jordan .
speeches were made by Willie Mays , Gi@@ ants teammates Omar V@@ iz@@ qu@@ el and Rich Aur@@ ilia , and Gi@@ ants owner Peter Mag@@ ow@@ an .
mayor Gav@@ in News@@ om presented Bon@@ ds the key to the City and County of San Francisco and Gi@@ ants vice president Larry Ba@@ er gave Bon@@ ds the home plate he touched after hitting his 75@@ 6th career home run .
the record @-@ setting ball was consigned to an auction house on August 21 .
bidding began on August 28 and closed with a winning bid of US $ 75@@ 2,4@@ 67 on September 15 after a three phase online auction .
the high bidder , fashion designer Marc E@@ cko , created a website to let fans decide its fate .
subsequently , Ben Pad@@ nos , who submitted the $ 18@@ 6,@@ 750 winning bid on Bon@@ ds &apos;s record @-@ tying 75@@ 5th home run ball also set up a website to let fans decide its fate .
of E@@ cko &apos;s plans , Bon@@ ds said &quot; He spent $ 750,000 on the ball and that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing with it ? what he &apos;s doing is stupid . &quot; 10 million voters helped E@@ cko decide to brand the ball with an asterisk and send it to the National Bas@@ eball Hall of F@@ ame and Museum .
Pad@@ nos sold 5 @-@ year ads on a website , www.@@ end@@ the@@ deb@@ at@@ e.@@ com , where people voted by a two @-@ to @-@ one margin to smash the ball .
bonds concluded the 2007 season with a .@@ 276 bat@@ ting average , 28 home runs , and 66 RB@@ Is in 126 games and 340 at bats .
at the age of 43 , he led both leagues in walks with 132 .

on September 21 , 2007 , the San Francisco Gi@@ ants confirmed that they would not re @-@ sign Bon@@ ds for the 2008 season .
the story was first announced on Bon@@ ds &apos;s own web site earlier that day .
bonds officially filed for free agency on October 29 , 2007 .
his agent Jeff Bor@@ ris said : &quot; I &apos;m anticipating widespread interest from every Major League team . &quot; there was much speculation before the 2008 season about where Bon@@ ds might play .
however , no one signed him during the 2008 or 2009 seasons .
if he had returned to Major League Bas@@ eball , Bon@@ ds would have been within close range of several significant hitting milestones : needing just 65 hits to reach 3,000 , 4 runs bat@@ ted in to reach 2,000 , and 38 home runs to reach 800 .
he would have needed 69 more runs scored to move past Ric@@ key Henderson as the all @-@ time runs champion , and 37 extra base hits to move past Hank Aaron as the all @-@ time extra base hits champion .
as of November 13 , 2009 , Bor@@ ris maintained that Bon@@ ds was still not retired .
on December 9 , however , Bor@@ ris told the &quot; San Francisco Chronicle &quot; that Bon@@ ds had played his last major league game .
bonds announced on April 11 , 2010 , that he was proud of Mc@@ G@@ wire for admitting his use of steroids .
bonds said that it was not the time to retire , but he noted that he was not in shape to play immediately if an interested club called him .
in May 2015 , Bon@@ ds filed a grievance against Major League Bas@@ eball through the players &apos; union arguing that the league coll@@ uded in not signing him after the 2007 season .
in August 2015 , an arbitrator ruled in favor of M@@ LB and against Bon@@ ds in his collusion case .
on December 15 , 2011 , Bon@@ ds was sentenced to 30 days of house arrest , two years of probation and 250 hours of community service , for an obstruction of justice conviction stemming from a grand jury appearance in 2003 .
however , U.S. District Judge Susan Ill@@ ston then delayed the sentence pending an appeal .
in 2013 his conviction was upheld on appeal by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit .
however , the full court later granted Bon@@ ds an en ban@@ c re@@ hearing , and on April 22 , 2015 , an 11 @-@ judge panel of the Ninth Circuit voted 10 @-@ 1 to overturn his conviction .
on March 10 , 2014 , Bon@@ ds began a seven @-@ day stint as a roving spring training instructor for the Gi@@ ants .
on December 4 , 2015 , he was announced as the new hitting coach for the Miami Mar@@ lins , but was relieved of his duties on October 3 , 2016 , after just one season .
he followed up with a public thank @-@ you letter , acknowledging owner Jeffrey Lor@@ ia , and the opportunity as &quot; one of the most rewarding experiences of my baseball career . &quot; in 2017 , Bon@@ ds officially rejoined the Gi@@ ants organization as a special advisor to the CEO .
on July 8 , 2017 , Bon@@ ds was added to the Gi@@ ants Wall of F@@ ame .
in his first six years of eligibility for induction to the National Bas@@ eball Hall of F@@ ame , Bon@@ ds received 36@@ .2 % , 3@@ 4.7 % , 3@@ 6.8 % , 4@@ 4.3 % , 5@@ 3.8 % , and 56@@ .4 % of the vote , all short of the 75 % needed for induction .
on February 6 , 2018 , the San Francisco Gi@@ ants announced their intentions to retire his number 25 jersey , which happened on August 11 , 2018 .
his number 24 with the Pir@@ ates remains in circulation , most prominently worn by Brian G@@ iles from 1999 to 2003 and by Pedro Alvarez from 2011 to 2015 .
</p>
<p>
during his playing career , Bon@@ ds was frequently described as a difficult person , sur@@ ly , stan@@ do@@ ff@@ ish and ungrateful .
however , in one interview with Ter@@ ence Moore in 2016 , he acknowledged regret over the persona which he had created .
he attributed it to a response to the pressure he felt to perform as a young player with the Pir@@ ates .
remarked Bon@@ ds , Hell , I kick myself now , because I &apos;m getting great press &#91; since being more cooperative &#93; , and I could have had a trillion more endorsements , but that wasn &apos;t my driving force .
the problem was , when I tried to give in a little bit , it never got better .
I knew I was in the midst of that image , and I determined at that point that I was never going to get out of it .
so I just said , &apos; I &apos;ve created this fire around me , and I &apos;m stuck in it , so I might as well live with the flames . &apos;
bonds reports that for a short time during his playing days with the Gi@@ ants he changed his demeanor at the behest of a group of teammates , resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant attitude .
shortly thereafter , Bon@@ ds says , in the midst of a slump , the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert , having seemingly lost his competitive edge , and causing the team lose more .
in spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results , his teammates insisted .
bonds says he complied , maintaining that familiar stan@@ do@@ ff@@ ish edge the rest of his playing career .

since 2003 , Bon@@ ds has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co @-@ operative scandal .
BAL@@ CO marketed tetra@@ hydro@@ ge@@ str@@ in@@ one , a performance @-@ enhancing an@@ abol@@ ic steroid that was un@@ detectable by doping tests .
he was under investigation by a federal grand jury regarding his testimony in the BAL@@ CO case , and was indicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges on November 15 , 2007 .
the indictment alleges that Bon@@ ds lied while under oath about his alleged use of steroids .
in 2003 , Bon@@ ds first became embroiled in a scandal when Greg Anderson of the Bay Area Laboratory Co @-@ operative , Bon@@ ds &apos;s trainer since 2000 , was indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and charged with supplying an@@ abol@@ ic steroids to athletes , including a number of baseball players .
this led to speculation that Bon@@ ds had used performance @-@ enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Bas@@ eball .
bonds declared his innocence , attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of body@@ building , diet , and legitimate supplements .
during grand jury testimony on December 4 , 2003 , Bon@@ ds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer , Greg Anderson , who told him they were the nutritional supplement fla@@ x@@ seed oil and a rubbing bal@@ m for arthritis .
this testimony , as reported by L@@ ance Williams and Mark F@@ ain@@ ar@@ u @-@ W@@ ada , has frequently been misrepresented .
later reports on Bon@@ ds &apos;s leaked grand @-@ jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using &quot; the cream &quot; and &quot; the clear . &quot; in July 2005 , all four defendants in the BAL@@ CO steroid scandal trial , including Anderson , struck deals with federal prosecutors that did not require them to reveal names of athletes who may have used banned drugs .
</p>
<p>
on November 15 , 2007 , Bon@@ ds was indicted on four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice as it relates to the government investigation of BAL@@ CO .
on February 14 , 2008 , a typ@@ o in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that Bon@@ ds tested positive for steroids in November 2001 , a month after hitting his record 73rd home run .
the reference was meant instead to refer to a November 2000 test that had already been disclosed and previously reported .
the typ@@ o sparked a brief media frenzy .
his trial for obstruction of justice was to have begun on March 2 , 2009 , but jury selection was postponed by 11th @-@ hour appeals by the prosecution .
the trial commenced on March 21 , 2011 , in U. S. District Court , Northern District of California , with Judge Susan Ill@@ ston presiding .
he was convicted on April 13 , 2011 , on the obstruction of justice charge , for giving an evasive answer to a question under oath .
his sentence did not include prison .
the conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2013 , but a larger panel of the court voted 10 @-@ 1 to overturn the conviction on April 22 , 2015 .

bonds withdrew from the M@@ LB P@@ layers Association &apos;s licensing agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him .
bonds is the first player in the thirty @-@ year history of the licensing program not to sign .
because of this withdrawal , his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the ML@@ B@@ PA .
in order to use his name or likeness , a company must deal directly with Bon@@ ds .
for this reason he does not appear in some baseball video games , forcing game @-@ makers to create generic athletes to replace him .
for example , Bon@@ ds is replaced by &quot; Jon Dow@@ d &quot; in &quot; M@@ VP Bas@@ eball 2005 . &quot;

<p>
in March 2006 the book &quot; Game of Sh@@ adows &quot; , written by L@@ ance Williams and Mark F@@ ain@@ ar@@ u @-@ W@@ ada , was released amid a storm of media publicity including the cover of &quot; Sports Illu@@ strated &quot; .
initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of &quot; Sports Illu@@ strated &quot; .
the book alleges Bon@@ ds used stan@@ oz@@ ol@@ ol and a host of other steroids , and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bon@@ ds &apos;s steroid use .
the book contained excerpts of grand jury testimony that is supposed to be sealed and confidential by law .
the authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources and at one point faced jail time .
on February 14 , 2007 , Troy El@@ ler@@ man , one of Victor Con@@ te &apos;s lawyers , pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony .
through the plea agreement , he will spend two and a half years in jail .
</p>
<p>
in May 2006 , former &quot; Sports Illu@@ strated &quot; writer Jeff Pear@@ lman released a revealing biography of Bon@@ ds entitled &quot; Love Me , H@@ ate Me : Barry Bon@@ ds and the Making of an Anti @-@ Hero . &quot; the book also contained many allegations against Bon@@ ds .
the book , which describes Bon@@ ds as a polar@@ izing in@@ suffer@@ able bra@@ gg@@ art with a legendary ego and staggering ability , relied on over five hundred interviews , except with Bon@@ ds himself .
</p>
<p>
in April 2006 and May 2006 , ES@@ PN aired a few episodes of a 10 @-@ part reality TV series starring Bon@@ ds .
the show , titled &quot; Bon@@ ds on Bon@@ ds &quot; , focused on Bon@@ ds &apos;s chase of Ba@@ be Ruth &apos;s and Hank Aaron &apos;s home run records .
some felt the show should be put on hiatus until baseball investigated Bon@@ ds &apos;s steroid use allegations .
the series was canceled in June 2006 , ES@@ PN and producer Tol@@ lin / Rob@@ bins Produc@@ tions citing &quot; creative control &quot; issues with Bon@@ ds and his representatives .

bonds met Sus@@ ann Mar@@ gre@@ th Bran@@ co , the mother of his first two children , in Montreal , Quebec in August 1987 .
they el@@ oped to Las Vegas February 5 , 1988 .
the couple separated in June 1994 , divorced in December 1994 , and had their marriage annulled in 1997 by the Catholic Church .
the divorce was a media affair because Bon@@ ds had his Swedish spouse sign a pren@@ uptial agreement in which she &quot; waived her right to a share of his present and future earnings &quot; and which was upheld .
bonds had been providing his wife $ 20,000 / month in child support and $ 10,000 in spousal support at the time of the ruling .
during the hearings to set permanent support levels , allegations of abuse came from both parties .
the trial dragged on for months , but Bon@@ ds was awarded both houses and reduced support .
on August 21 , 2000 , the Supreme Court of California , in an opinion signed by Chief Justice Ronald M. George , unanimously held that &quot; substantial evidence supports the determination of the trial court that the &#91; pren@@ uptial &#93; agreement in the present case was entered into voluntarily . &quot; in reaction to the decision , significant changes in California law relating to the validity and enforceability of premarital agreements soon followed .
in 2010 , Bon@@ ds &apos;s son Nikol@@ ai , who served as a Gi@@ ants bat@@ boy during his father &apos;s years playing in San Francisco and always sat next to his dad in the du@@ gout during games , was charged with five misdemean@@ ors resulting from a confrontation with his mother , Sun .
Barry accompanied him to San Mat@@ eo County Superior Court .
after the end of his first marriage , Bon@@ ds had an extensive intimate relationship with Kimberly Bell from 1994 through May 2003 .
bonds purchased a home in Scot@@ ts@@ dale , Arizona for Kimberly .
on January 10 , 1998 , Bon@@ ds married his second wife , Liz Watson , at the San Francisco R@@ itz @-@ Carl@@ ton Hotel in front of 240 guests .
the couple lived in Los Al@@ tos Hills , California , with their daughter A@@ isha during their ten @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years of marriage before Watson filed for legal separation on June 9 , 2009 , citing irreconcilable differences .
on July 21 , 2009 , just six weeks later , Watson announced that she was withdrawing her Legal Separation action .
the couple were reconciled for seven months before Watson formally filed for divorce in Los Angeles on February 26 , 2010 .
on June 6 , 2011 , Bon@@ ds and Watson filed a legal agreement not to take the divorce to trial and instead settle it in an &quot; uncontested manner , &quot; effectively agreeing to take the proceedings out of the public eye and end the marriage privately at an unspecified later date without further court involvement .
several of Bon@@ ds &apos;s family and extended family members have been involved in athletics as either a career or a notable pastime .
bonds has a younger brother , Bobby , Jr . , who was also a professional baseball player .
his paternal aunt , Ro@@ sie Bon@@ ds , is a former American record holder in the 80 meter hurdles , and competed in the 1964 Olympics .
in addition , he is a distant cousin of Hall of Fam@@ er Reg@@ gie Jackson .
among Bon@@ ds &apos;s many real estate properties is a home he owns in the exclusive gated community of Bever@@ ly Park in Bever@@ ly Hills , California .
an avid cyclist , Bon@@ ds chose the activity to be a primary means of keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career .
because knee surgeries , back surgeries , and hip surgeries made it much more difficult to run , cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape .
as a result of the cycling , he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds .
</p>
<p>
besides holding Major League career records in home runs , walks , and intentional walks , at the time of his retirement , Bon@@ ds also led all active players in RB@@ I , on @-@ base percentage , runs , games , extra @-@ base hits , at @-@ bats per home run , and total bases .
he is 2nd in doubles , slu@@ gging percentage , stolen bases , at @-@ bats , and hits , 6th in tri@@ ples , 8th in sacrifice flies , and 9th in stri@@ ke@@ outs , through September 26 , 2007 .
bonds is the lone member of the 500 @-@ 500 club , which means he has hit at least 500 home runs and stolen at least 500 bases ; no other player has even 400 of both .
he is also one of only four baseball players all @-@ time to be in the 40 @-@ 40 club , which means he hit 40 home runs and stole 40 bases in the same season ; the other members are José Can@@ sec@@ o , Alex Rodriguez , and Alfonso S@@ ori@@ ano .

the Book of Ruth is included in the third division , or the W@@ ri@@ tings , of the Hebrew Bible ; in most Christian can@@ ons it is treated as a history book and placed between Judges and 1 Samuel , as it is set &quot; in the days when the judges judged , &quot; although the Syri@@ ac Christian tradition places it later , between Ec@@ clesi@@ ast@@ es and the Song of Son@@ gs .
it is named after its central figure , Ruth the Mo@@ ab@@ it@@ ess , the great @-@ grandmother of David .
the book tells of Ruth &apos;s accepting the God of the Israelites as her God and the Israel@@ ite people as her own .
in Ruth 1 : 16 @-@ 17 , Ruth tells Naomi , her Israel@@ ite mother @-@ in @-@ law , &quot; Where you go I will go , and where you stay I will stay . your people will be my people and your God my God . where you die I will die , and there I will be buried . may the Lord deal with me , be it ever so severely , if even death separates you and me . &quot; the book is held in esteem by Jews who fall under the category of Jews @-@ by @-@ choice , as is evidenced by the considerable presence of Bo@@ az in rab@@ bin@@ ic literature .
the Book of Ruth also functions lit@@ ur@@ g@@ ically , as it is read during the Jewish holiday of Sha@@ v@@ u@@ ot .
</p>
<p>
the book is structured in four chapters : Act 1 : pro@@ lo@@ gue and Problem : death and Emp@@ tiness Act 2 :
Ruth Meets Bo@@ az , Naomi &apos;s Relative , on the Harv@@ est Field Act 3 :
Naomi S@@ ends Ruth to Bo@@ az on the Th@@ res@@ hing Floor Act 4 : resolution and E@@ pil@@ ogue : life and Ful@@ l@@ ness Gen@@ eal@@ og@@ ical appendix
</p>
<p>
during the time of the judges when there was a famine , an Israel@@ ite family from Bethlehem - Elim@@ elech , his wife Naomi , and their sons Mah@@ lon and Ch@@ ilion - emigrated to the nearby country of Moab .
Elim@@ elech died , and the sons married two Mo@@ ab@@ ite women : Mah@@ lon married Ruth and Ch@@ ilion married Or@@ pah .
after about ten years , the two sons of Naomi also died in Moab .
Naomi decided to return to Bethlehem .
she told her daughters @-@ in @-@ law to return to their own mothers and remarry .
Or@@ pah reluctantly left ; however , Ruth said , &quot; Do not urge me to leave you , to turn back and not follow you . for wherever you go , I will go ; wherever you lodge , I will lodge ; your people shall be my people , and your God my God . where you die , I will die , and there I will be buried . thus and more may the Lord do to me if anything but death parts me from you . &quot; .
the two women returned to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest , and in order to support her mother @-@ in @-@ law and herself , Ruth went to the fields to g@@ lean .
as it happened , the field she went to belonged to a man named Bo@@ az , who was kind to her because he had heard of her loyalty to her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Ruth told Naomi of Bo@@ az &apos;s kindness , and she gleaned in his field through the remainder of barley and wheat harvest .
Bo@@ az was a close relative of Naomi &apos;s husband &apos;s family .
he was therefore obliged by the Lev@@ irate law to marry Mah@@ lon &apos;s widow , Ruth , in order to carry on his family &apos;s inheritance .
Naomi sent Ruth to the thres@@ hing floor at night and told her to go where he slept , and &quot; uncover his feet and lie down . he will tell you what you are to do . &quot; .
Bo@@ az asked her who she was , and she replied :
&quot; I am your hand@@ maid Ruth . spread your robe over your hand@@ maid , for you are a re@@ deeming kin@@ sman &quot; .
Bo@@ az blessed her and agreed to do all that is required , and he noted that , &quot; all the elders of my town know what a fine woman you are &quot; .
he then acknowledged that he was a close relative , but that there was one who was closer , and she remained in submission at his feet until she returned into the city in the morning .
early that day , Bo@@ az went to the city gate to meet with the other male relative before the town elders .
the relative is not named : Bo@@ az addresses him as &quot; pl@@ oni al@@ mon@@ i &quot; , literally &quot; so and so . &quot; the unnamed relative is unwilling to jeopardize the inheritance of his own estate by marrying Ruth , and so relinquished his right of redemption , thus allowing Bo@@ az to marry Ruth .
they transferred the property and redeemed it , ratified by the nearer kin@@ sman taking off his shoe and handing it over to Bo@@ az .
Ruth 4 : 7 notes for later generations that : :
now this was formerly done in Israel in cases of redemption or exchange : to validate any transaction , one man would take off his sand@@ al and hand it to the other .
such was the practice in Israel .
Bo@@ az and Ruth were then married and have a son .
the women of the city celebrate Naomi &apos;s joy , for Naomi found a re@@ deem@@ er for her family name , and Naomi takes the child and places it in her bosom .
the child is named O@@ bed , who we discover is &quot; the father of Jesse , the father of David &quot; , that is , the grandfather of King David .
the book concludes with an appendix which traces the Davi@@ dic geneal@@ ogy all the way back from Perez , &quot; whom Tamar bore to Judah , &quot; through to O@@ bed , down to David .
</p>
<p>
the book does not name its author .
it is traditionally ascribed to the prophet Samuel , but Ruth &apos;s identity as a non @-@ Israel@@ ite and the stress on the need for an inclusive attitude towards foreigners suggests an origin in the fifth century BC , when inter@@ marriage had become controversial .
a substantial number of scholars therefore date it to the Persian period .
the geneal@@ ogy that concludes the book is believed to be a post @-@ ex@@ il@@ ic Pri@@ estly addition , as it adds nothing to the plot ; nevertheless , it is carefully crafted and integrates the book into the history of Israel running from Genesis to Kings .
</p>
<p>
the Book of Ruth illustrates the difficulty of trying to use laws given in books such as De@@ uter@@ onomy as evidence of actual practice .
Naomi plans to provide security for herself and Ruth by arranging a Lev@@ irate marriage with Bo@@ az .
she instructs Ruth to uncover Bo@@ az &apos;s feet after he has gone to sleep and lie down .
when Bo@@ az wakes up , surprised to see a woman at his feet , Ruth explains she wants him to redeem her .
many modern commentators see sexual allu@@ sions in this part of the story , arguing that &apos; feet &apos; is a euphemism for genitals .
since there was no heir to inherit Elim@@ elech &apos;s land , custom required a close relative to marry the widow of the deceased in order to continue his family line .
this relative was called the go &apos;@@ el , the &quot; kin@@ sman @-@ re@@ deem@@ er . &quot; as Bo@@ az is not Elim@@ elech &apos;s brother , nor is Ruth his widow , scholars refer to the arrangement here as &quot; Lev@@ irate @-@ like . &quot; a complication arises in the story : another man is a closer relative to Elim@@ elech than Bo@@ az and has first claim on Ruth .
it is resolved through the custom that required land to stay in the family : a family could mortgage land to ward off poverty , but the law required a kin@@ sman to purchase it back into the family .
Bo@@ az meets the near kin@@ sman at the city gate ; the kin@@ sman first says he will purchase Elim@@ elech &apos;s land , but , upon hearing he must also take Ruth as his wife , withdraws his offer .
Bo@@ az thus becomes Ruth and Naomi &apos;s &quot; kin@@ sman @-@ re@@ deem@@ er . &quot;
</p>
<p>
the book can be read as a political parable relating to issues around the time of Ez@@ ra and Ne@@ hem@@ iah .
contrary to the message of Ez@@ ra @-@ Ne@@ hem@@ iah , where marriages between Jewish men and non @-@ Jewish women were broken up , Ruth teaches that foreigners who convert to Judaism can become good Jews , foreign wives can become exemplary followers of Jewish law , and there is no reason to exclude them or their offspring from the community .
</p>
<p>
scholars have increasingly explored Ruth in ways which allow it to address contemporary issues .
fem@@ inists , for example , have recast the story as one of the dignity of labour and female self @-@ sufficiency , and even as a model for lesbian relations , while others have seen in it a celebration of the relationship between strong and resourceful women .
others have criticised it for its underlying , and potentially exploitative , acceptance of a system of patriarch@@ y in which a woman &apos;s worth can only be measured through marriage and child @-@ bearing .
others again have seen it as a book that champions out@@ cast and oppressed peoples .

Charles Har@@ din Hol@@ ley , known as Bud@@ dy Holly , was an American musician , singer @-@ song@@ writer and record producer who was a central and pioneering figure of mid @-@ 1950s rock and roll .
he was born in Lub@@ b@@ ock , Texas , to a musical family during the Great Depression , and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings .
his style was influenced by gospel music , country music , and rhythm and blues acts , and he performed in Lub@@ b@@ ock with his friends from high school .
he made his first appearance on local television in 1952 , and the following year he formed the group &quot; Bud@@ dy and Bob &quot; with his friend Bob Montgomery .
in 1955 , after opening for Elvis Pres@@ ley , he decided to pursue a career in music .
he opened for Pres@@ ley three times that year ; his band &apos;s style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll .
in October that year , when he opened for Bill Hal@@ ey &amp; His Com@@ ets , he was spotted by Nash@@ ville scout Eddie Cran@@ d@@ all , who helped him get a contract with Dec@@ ca Records .
Holly &apos;s recording sessions at Dec@@ ca were produced by Owen Bradley , who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like Pat@@ sy C@@ line .
unhappy with Bradley &apos;s musical style and control in the studio , Holly went to producer Norman Pe@@ tty in Clo@@ vis , New Mexico , and recorded a demo of &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day , &quot; among other songs .
petty became the band &apos;s manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records , which released it as a single credited to &quot; The C@@ ric@@ kets , &quot; which became the name of Holly &apos;s band .
in September 1957 , as the band toured , &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day &quot; topped the US and UK singles charts .
its success was followed in October by another major hit , &quot; Peggy Sue . &quot; the album &quot; Chir@@ ping C@@ ric@@ kets &quot; , released in November 1957 , reached number five on the UK Alb@@ ums Chart .
Holly made his second appearance on &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show &quot; in January 1958 and soon after , toured Australia and then the UK .
in early 1959 , he assembled a new band , consisting of future country music star Way@@ lon Jenn@@ ings , famed session musician Tommy All@@ sup , and Carl Bun@@ ch , and embarked on a tour of the mid@@ western U.S. After a show in Clear Lake , Iowa , he chartered an airplane to travel to his next show , in Far@@ go , North Dakota .
soon after takeoff , the plane crashed , killing Holly , Rit@@ chi@@ e Val@@ ens , The Big B@@ op@@ per , and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by Don Mc@@ Lean as &quot; The Day the Music Di@@ ed . &quot; during his short career , Holly wrote , recorded , and produced his own material .
he is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock @-@ and @-@ roll lineup of two guit@@ ars , bass , and drums .
he was a major influence on later popular music artists , including Bob D@@ ylan , The Beatles , The Rolling St@@ ones , Eric Cl@@ ap@@ ton , and El@@ ton John .
he was among the first artists induc@@ ted into the Rock and Roll Hall of F@@ ame , in 1986 . &quot;
rolling Stone &quot; magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of &quot; 100 Great@@ est Artists . &quot;

Holly was born Charles Har@@ din Hol@@ ley on September 7 , 1936 , in Lub@@ b@@ ock , Texas ; he was the fourth child of Lawrence O@@ dell &quot; L.@@ O. &quot; Hol@@ ley and El@@ la Pauline Drake .
his elder siblings were Larry , Tra@@ vis , and Patricia Lou .
Bud@@ dy Holly was of mostly English and Welsh descent but also had small amounts of Native American ancestry as well .
from early childhood , he was nicknamed &quot; Bud@@ dy . &quot; during the Great Depression , the Hol@@ leys frequently moved residence within Lub@@ b@@ ock ; L.@@ O. changed jobs several times .
Bud@@ dy Holly was baptized a Baptist , and the family were members of the Tab@@ er@@ nacle Baptist Church .
the Hol@@ leys had an interest in music ; all the family members except L.@@ O. were able to play an instrument or sing .
the elder Hol@@ ley brothers performed in local talent shows ; on one occasion , Bud@@ dy joined them on violin .
since he could not play it , his brother Larry gre@@ ased the strings so it would not make any sound .
the brothers won the contest .
during World War II , Larry and Tra@@ vis were called to military service .
upon his return , Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a ship@@ mate while serving in the Pacific .
at age 11 , Bud@@ dy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months .
he switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus .
Bud@@ dy &apos;s parents initially bought him a steel guitar , but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother &apos;s .
his parents bought the guitar from a paw@@ n@@ shop , and Tra@@ vis taught him to play it .
during his early childhood , Hol@@ ley was influenced by the music of Hank Williams , Jim@@ mie Rod@@ gers , Hank Snow , Bob W@@ ills , and the Carter Family .
at Ro@@ sco@@ e Wilson Elementary , he became friends with Bob Montgomery , and the two played together , practicing with songs by the Lou@@ vin Brothers and John@@ nie &amp; Jack .
they both listened to the radio programs &quot; Grand Ole O@@ pry &quot; on WS@@ M , &quot; Louisiana Hay@@ ride &quot; on K@@ WK@@ H , and &quot; Big D Jam@@ bor@@ ee &quot; .
at the same time , Hol@@ ley played with other musicians he met in high school , including Sonny Curtis and Jerry All@@ ison .
in 1952 , Hol@@ ley and Jack Ne@@ al participated as a duo billed as &quot; Bud@@ dy and Jack &quot; in a talent contest on a local television show .
after Ne@@ al left , he was replaced by Montgomery and they were billed as &quot; Bud@@ dy and Bob . &quot; the two soon started performing on the &quot; Sunday Party &quot; show on K@@ DA@@ V in 1953 and performed live gig@@ s in Lub@@ b@@ ock .
at that time , Hol@@ ley was influenced by late @-@ night radio stations that played blues and rhythm and blues .
Hol@@ ley would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night , when local transmissions ceased .
Hol@@ ley then modified his music by blending his earlier country and western influence with R &amp; B. By 1955 , after graduating from high school , Hol@@ ley decided to pursue a full @-@ time career in music .
he was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Pres@@ ley performing live in Lub@@ b@@ ock , whose act was booked by P@@ appy Dave Stone of K@@ DA@@ V .
in February , Hol@@ ley opened for Pres@@ ley at the Fair Park Col@@ is@@ eum , in April at the Cotton Club , and again in June at the Col@@ is@@ eum .
by that time , he had incorporated into his band Larry Wel@@ born on the stand @-@ up bass and All@@ ison on drums , as his style shifted from C &amp; W to rock and roll due to seeing Pres@@ ley &apos;s performances and hearing his music .
in October , Stone booked Bill Hal@@ ey &amp; His Com@@ ets and placed Hol@@ ley as the opening act to be seen by Nash@@ ville scout Eddie Cran@@ d@@ all .
impressed , Cran@@ d@@ all persuaded Grand Ole O@@ pry manager Jim D@@ enny to seek a recording contract for Hol@@ ley .
stone sent a demo tape , which D@@ enny forwarded to Paul Cohen , who signed the band to Dec@@ ca Records in February 1956 .
in the contract , Dec@@ ca mis@@ spelled Hol@@ ley &apos;s last name as &quot; Holly &quot; ; from then on , he was known as &quot; Bud@@ dy Holly . &quot; on January 26 , 1956 , Holly attended his first formal recording session , which was produced by Owen Bradley .
he attended two more sessions in Nash@@ ville , but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements , Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control .
in April 1956 , Dec@@ ca released &quot; Blue Days , Black Ni@@ ghts &quot; as a single , with &quot; Love Me &quot; on the B @-@ side .
D@@ enny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for Far@@ on Young .
during the tour , they were promoted as &quot; Bud@@ dy Holly and the Two T@@ ones , &quot; while later Dec@@ ca called them &quot; Bud@@ dy Holly and the Three Tunes . &quot; the label later released Holly &apos;s second single &quot; Modern Don Juan , &quot; backed with &quot; You Are My One De@@ sire . &quot; neither single made an impression .
on January 22 , 1957 , Dec@@ ca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed , but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years .
</p>
<p>
Holly was unhappy with the results of his time with Dec@@ ca ; he was inspired by the success of Bud@@ dy Kno@@ x &apos;s &quot; Party D@@ oll &quot; and Jimmy Bow@@ en &apos;s &quot; I &apos;m S@@ tic@@ kin &apos; with You , &quot; and visited Norman Pe@@ tty , who had produced and promoted both records .
together with All@@ ison , b@@ assist Joe B. Ma@@ ul@@ din , and rhythm guit@@ arist Nik@@ i Sullivan , he went to Pe@@ tty &apos;s studio in Clo@@ vis , New Mexico .
the group recorded a demo of &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day , &quot; a song they had previously recorded in Nash@@ ville .
now playing lead guitar , Holly achieved the sound he desired .
petty became his manager and sent the record to Brunswick Records in New York City .
Holly , still under contract with Dec@@ ca , could not release the record under his name , so a band name was used ;
All@@ ison proposed the name &quot; C@@ ric@@ kets . &quot; Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day , &quot; leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings .
impressed with the demo , the label &apos;s executives released it without recording a new version .
&quot; I &apos;m Looking for Someone to Love &quot; was the B @-@ side ; the single was credited to the C@@ ric@@ kets .
petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Dec@@ ca , which legally cleared future recordings under the name Bud@@ dy Holly .
recordings credited to the C@@ ric@@ kets would be released on Brunswick , while the recordings under Holly &apos;s name were released on another subsidiary label , Coral Records .
Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels .
&quot; that &apos;ll Be the Day &quot; was released on May 27 , 1957 .
petty booked Holly and the C@@ ric@@ kets for a tour with Ir@@ vin F@@ eld , who had noticed the band after &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day &quot; appeared on the R &amp; B chart .
he booked them for appearances in Washington , D.C. , Baltimore , and New York City .
the band was booked to play at New York &apos;s Apollo Theater on August 16 @-@ 22 .
during the opening performances , the group did not impress the audience , but they were accepted after they included &quot; Bo Did@@ d@@ ley &quot; in their shows .
by the end of their run at the Apollo , &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day &quot; was climbing the charts .
encouraged by the single &apos;s success , Pe@@ tty started to prepare two album releases ; a solo album for Holly and another for the C@@ ric@@ kets .
Holly appeared on &quot; American Band@@ stand &quot; , hosted by Dick Clark on ABC , on August 26 .
before leaving New York , the band be@@ fri@@ ended the Ever@@ ly Brothers .
on September 20 , Coral released &quot; Peggy Sue , &quot; backed with &quot; Every@@ day , &quot; with Holly credited as the performer .
by October , &quot; Peggy Sue &quot; had reached number three on &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; &apos; s pop chart and number two on the R &amp; B chart ; it peaked at number six on the UK Sing@@ les chart .
as the success of the song grew , it brought more attention to Holly , with the band at the time being billed as &quot; Bud@@ dy Holly and the C@@ ric@@ kets . &quot; in the last week of September , the band members flew to Lub@@ b@@ ock to visit their families .
Holly &apos;s high school girlfriend , E@@ cho Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , had left him for a fellow student .
aside from Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , Holly had a relationship with Lub@@ b@@ ock fan June Clark .
after Clark ended their relationship , Holly realized the importance of his relationship with Mc@@ Gu@@ ire and considered his with Clark a temporary one .
meanwhile , for their return to recording , Pe@@ tty arranged a session in Oklahoma City , where he was performing with his own band .
while the band drove to the location , the producer set up a makeshift studio .
the rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded ; Pe@@ tty later dubbed the material in Clo@@ vis .
the resulting album , &quot; The &quot; Chir@@ ping &quot; C@@ ric@@ kets &quot; , was released on November 27 , 1957 .
it reached number five on the UK Alb@@ ums Chart .
in October , Brunswick released the second single by the C@@ ric@@ kets , &quot; Oh , Boy ! , &quot; with &quot; Not F@@ ade Away &quot; on the B @-@ side .
the single reached number 10 on the pop chart and 13 on the R &amp; B chart .
Holly and the C@@ ric@@ kets performed &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day &quot; and &quot; Peggy Sue &quot; on &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show &quot; on December 1 , 1957 .
following the appearance , Nik@@ i Sullivan left the group because of the intensive touring .
on December 29 , Holly and the C@@ ric@@ kets performed &quot; Peggy Sue &quot; on &quot; The Arthur Murray Party &quot; .
</p>
<p>
on January 8 , 1958 , Holly and the C@@ ric@@ kets joined &quot; America &apos;s Great@@ est Te@@ en@@ age Recording Stars &quot; tour .
on January 25 , Holly recorded &quot; R@@ ave On &quot; ; the next day , he made his second appearance on &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show &quot; , singing &quot; Oh , Boy ! &quot; he departed to perform in Honolulu , Hawaii , on January 27 , and then started a week @-@ long tour of Australia .
in March , the band toured the United Kingdom , playing 50 shows in 25 days .
the same month , his debut solo album , &quot; Bud@@ dy Holly &quot; , was released .
upon their return to the United States , Holly and the C@@ ric@@ kets joined Alan Fre@@ ed &apos;s &quot; Big Be@@ at Show &quot; tour for 41 dates .
in April , Dec@@ ca released &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day &quot; , featuring the songs recorded with Bradley during his early Nash@@ ville sessions .
a new recording session in Clo@@ vis was arranged in May ; Holly hired Tommy All@@ sup to play lead guitar .
the session produced the recordings of &quot; It &apos;s So Easy &quot; and &quot; Hear@@ t@@ beat . &quot; Holly was impressed by All@@ sup and invited him to join the C@@ ric@@ kets .
in June , Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session .
without the C@@ ric@@ kets , he chose to be backed by a jazz and R &amp; B band , recording &quot; Now We &apos;re One &quot; and Bobby Dar@@ in &apos;s &quot; Early in the Morning . &quot; during a visit to the offices of Peer @-@ South , Holly met María Elena Santiago .
he asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date .
the wedding took place on August 15 .
petty disapproved of the marriage and advised Holly to keep it secret to avoid upsetting Holly &apos;s female fans .
petty &apos;s reaction created friction with Holly , who had also started to question Pe@@ tty &apos;s bookkeeping .
the C@@ ric@@ kets , frustrated because he controlled all of the proceeds from the band , were also in conflict with Pe@@ tty .
Holly and Santiago frequented many of New York &apos;s music venues , including the Village Gate , Blue Note , Village Van@@ guard , and Johnny Johnson &apos;s .
Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn finger@@ style fla@@ men@@ co guitar and that he would often visit her aunt &apos;s home to play the piano there .
Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll .
he wanted to make an album with Ray Charles and Ma@@ hal@@ ia Jackson .
he also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Stra@@ sberg &apos;s Ac@@ tors Studio .
Santiago accompanied Holly on tours .
to hide her marriage to Holly , she was presented as the C@@ ric@@ kets &apos; secretary .
she took care of the laundry and equipment set @-@ up and collected the concert revenues .
Santiago kept the money for the band instead of their habitual transfer to Pe@@ tty in New Mexico .
she and her aunt Provi Garcia , executive of the Latin American music department at Peer @-@ Southern , convinced Holly that Pe@@ tty was paying the band &apos;s royalties from Coral @-@ Brunswick into his own company &apos;s account .
Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Pe@@ tty and to later fire him as manager and producer .
at the recommendation of the Ever@@ ly Brothers , Holly hired lawyer Harold Or@@ en@@ stein to negotiate his royalties .
the problems with Pe@@ tty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly .
at the time , New York promoter M@@ anny Green@@ field reclaimed a large part of Holly &apos;s earnings ;
Green@@ field had booked Holly for shows during previous tours .
the two had a verbal agreement ; Green@@ field would obtain 5 % of the booking earnings .
Green@@ field later felt he was also acting as Holly &apos;s manager and deserved a higher payment , which Holly refused .
Green@@ field then sued Holly .
under New York law , because Holly &apos;s royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state , the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled .
petty then could not complete the transfers to Holly , who considered him responsible for the missing profit .
in September , Holly returned to Clo@@ vis for a new recording session , which yielded &quot; Rem@@ in@@ is@@ cing &quot; and &quot; Come Back Baby . &quot; during the session , he ventured into producing by recording Lub@@ b@@ ock DJ Way@@ lon Jenn@@ ings .
Holly produced the single &quot; J@@ ole Bl@@ on &quot; and &quot; When Sin St@@ ops &quot; for Jenn@@ ings .
Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music , recording , and publishing scene .
Santiago and he settled in A@@ partment 4@@ H of the Bre@@ vo@@ ort A@@ partments , at 11 Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village , where he recorded a series of acoustic songs , including &quot; C@@ rying , Waiting , H@@ oping &quot; and &quot; What to Do . &quot; the inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with Mc@@ Gu@@ ire .
in October , Holly recorded tracks for Coral ; these were backed by sa@@ x@@ ophon@@ ist Bo@@ om@@ ie Rich@@ man and an 18 @-@ piece orchestra composed of former members of the NBC Symphony Orchestra .
the three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hour session produced &quot; It Do@@ es@@ n &apos;t Matter Any@@ more , &quot; &quot; R@@ aining in My Heart , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ on@@ dreams &quot; , and &quot; True Love Ways . &quot; Holly ended his association with Pe@@ tty in December 1958 .
his band members kept Pe@@ tty as their manager , and Holly also split from the C@@ ric@@ kets .
petty was still holding the money from the royalties , forcing Holly to form a new band and return to touring .
</p>
<p>
Holly vac@@ ation@@ ed with his wife in Lub@@ b@@ ock and visited Jenn@@ ings &apos;s radio station in December 1958 .
for the start of the Winter Dance Party tour , he assembled a band consisting of Way@@ lon Jenn@@ ings , Tommy All@@ sup , and Carl Bun@@ ch .
Holly and Jenn@@ ings left for New York City , arriving on January 15 , 1959 .
Jenn@@ ings stayed at Holly &apos;s apartment by Washington Square Park on the days prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the General Artists Corporation , which organized the tour .
they then traveled by train to Chicago to join the rest of the band .
the Winter Dance Party tour began in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , on January 23 , 1959 .
the amount of travel involved created logistical problems , as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances .
adding to the problem , the un@@ heated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather , with dire consequences .
Holly &apos;s drummer Carl Bun@@ ch was hospitalized for fro@@ st@@ bite to his toes , so Holly decided to seek other transportation .
before their appearance in Clear Lake , Iowa , on February 2 , Holly chartered a four @-@ seat Be@@ ech@@ craft Bon@@ anza airplane from D@@ w@@ yer Flying Service in Mason City , Iowa , for Jenn@@ ings , All@@ sup , and himself .
Holly &apos;s idea was to depart following the show at the Sur@@ f Ball@@ room in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue , in Mo@@ or@@ head , Minnesota , via Far@@ go , North Dakota , allowing them time to rest and la@@ under their clothes and avoid a rigorous bus journey .
immediately after the Clear Lake show , All@@ sup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with Val@@ ens .
Val@@ ens called heads ; when he won , he reportedly said , &quot; That &apos;s the first time I &apos;ve ever won anything in my life , &quot; All@@ sup later opened a restaurant in Fort Wor@@ th , Texas called Heads Up .
Way@@ lon Jenn@@ ings voluntarily gave up his seat to J. P. Richardson , who had influenza and complained that the tour bus was too cold and uncomfortable for a man of his size .
the pilot , Roger Peterson , took off in incl@@ ement weather , although he was not certified to fly by instruments only .
shortly after 12.55 am on February 3 , 1959 , Holly , Val@@ ens , Richardson , and Peterson were killed instantly when their plane crashed into a frozen corn@@ field five miles northwest of the Mason City , Iowa airport shortly after takeoff .
the three musicians , who were ejected from the fus@@ elage upon impact , had suffered gross brain trauma and massive chest injuries .
Holly &apos;s funeral was held on February 7 , 1959 , at the Tab@@ er@@ nacle Baptist Church in Lub@@ b@@ ock .
the service was officiated by Ben D. Johnson , who had presided at the Holly &apos;s wedding just months earlier .
the pall@@ bearers were Jerry All@@ ison , Joe B. Ma@@ ul@@ din , Nik@@ i Sullivan , Bob Montgomery , and Sonny Curtis .
some sources say that Phil Ever@@ ly , the one half of The Ever@@ ly Brothers , was also the pall@@ bearer , but he said at one time that he attended the funeral but was not a pall@@ bearer .
Way@@ lon Jenn@@ ings was unable to attend , because of his commitment to the still @-@ touring Winter Dance Party .
Holly &apos;s body was inter@@ red in the City of Lub@@ b@@ ock Cemetery , in the eastern part of the city .
his head@@ stone carries the correct spelling of his surname and a carving of his F@@ ender Str@@ at@@ oc@@ aster guitar .
María Elena watched the first reports of Holly &apos;s death on television .
the following day , she claimed , she suffered a miscarriage , although there is no independent source for this .
Holly &apos;s mother , who heard the news on the radio in Lub@@ b@@ ock , Texas , screamed and collapsed .
because of Elena &apos;s miscarriage , in the months following the accident , the authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims &apos; names until after families are informed .
Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the grave site .
she later told the &quot; A@@ val@@ anche @-@ Journal &quot; , &quot; In a way , I blame myself . I was not feeling well when he left . I was two weeks pregnant , and I wanted Bud@@ dy to stay with me , but he had scheduled that tour . it was the only time I wasn &apos;t with him . and I blame myself because I know that , if only I had gone along , Bud@@ dy never would have gotten into that airplane . &quot;

Holly &apos;s singing style was characterized by his vocal hic@@ cups and his alternation between his regular voice and fal@@ set@@ to .
his &quot; st@@ uttering voc@@ als &quot; were complemented by his percus@@ sive guitar playing , sol@@ os , stops , bent notes , and rhythm and blues chord progres@@ sions .
he often str@@ um@@ med down@@ strokes that were accompanied by All@@ ison &apos;s &quot; driving &quot; percussion .
Holly bought his first F@@ ender Str@@ at@@ oc@@ aster , which became his signature guitar , at Har@@ rod Music in Lub@@ b@@ ock for US $ 24@@ 9.@@ 50 .
F@@ ender Str@@ at@@ oc@@ asters were popular with country musicians ; Holly chose it for its loud sound .
his &quot; innovative &quot; playing style was characterized by its blending of &quot; chun@@ ky rhythm &quot; and &quot; high string lead work . &quot; he played his first Str@@ at@@ oc@@ aster , a 1954 model , until it was stolen during a tour stop in Michigan in 1957 .
to replace it , he purchased a 1957 model before a show in Detroit .
Holly owned four or five Str@@ at@@ oc@@ asters during his career .
at the beginning of their music careers , Holly and his band wore business suits .
when they met the Ever@@ ly Brothers , Don Ever@@ ly took the band to Phil &apos;s men &apos;s shop in New York City and introduced them to Ivy League clothes .
the brothers advised Holly to replace his old @-@ fashioned glasses with horn @-@ rim@@ med glasses , which had been popularized by Steve Allen .
Holly bought a pair of glasses made in Mexico from Lub@@ b@@ ock opt@@ ome@@ tr@@ ist Dr. J. Davis Ar@@ mist@@ ead .
teenagers in the United States started to request this style of glasses , which were later popularly known as &quot; Bud@@ dy Holly glasses . &quot; when the plane crashed , the wreckage was strewn across many yards of snow @-@ covered ground .
while his other belongings were recovered immediately , there was no record of his signature glasses being found .
they were presumed lost until , in March 1980 , they were discovered in a C@@ err@@ o Gord@@ o County courthouse storage area by Sher@@ iff Gerald Allen .
they had been found in the spring of 1959 , after the snow had melted , and had been given to the sheriff &apos;s office .
they were placed in an envelope dated April 7 , 1959 , along with the Big B@@ op@@ per &apos;s watch , a lighter , two pairs of dice and part of another watch , and misplaced when the county moved cour@@ thouses .
the glasses , missing their lenses , were returned to Maria Elena a year later , after a legal contest over them with his parents .
they are now on display at the Bud@@ dy Holly Center in Lub@@ b@@ ock , Texas .

Bud@@ dy Holly left behind dozens of unfinished recordings : solo transcri@@ ptions of his new compositions ; informal jam sessions with band@@ mates ; or tapes demonstrating songs intended for other artists .
the most recent recordings , made in Holly &apos;s apartment in late 1958 , were his last six original songs .
in June 1959 , Coral Records over@@ dubbed two of them with backing voc@@ als by the Ray Charles Sing@@ ers and studio musicians in an attempt to simulate the established C@@ ric@@ kets sound .
the finished tracks became the first pos@@ thum@@ ous Holly single , &quot; Peggy Sue Go@@ t Married &quot; / &quot; C@@ rying , Waiting , H@@ oping . &quot; the new release was successful enough to warrant an album drawing upon the other Holly dem@@ os , using the same studio personnel , in January 1960 .
the demand for Holly records was so great , and Holly had recorded so pro@@ lif@@ ically , that his record label was able to release new Holly albums and singles for the next 10 years .
Norman Pe@@ tty produced most of these new editions , drawing upon un@@ released studio masters , alternative takes , audition tapes , and even amateur recordings .
on its entry , the Hall of F@@ ame remarked upon the large quantity of material he produced during his short musical career , and said it &quot; made a major and lasting impact on popular music . &quot; it called him an &quot; innov@@ ator &quot; for writing his own material , his experimentation with double tracking and the use of or@@ che@@ stration ; he is also said to have &quot; pioneered and popularized the now @-@ standard &quot; use of two guit@@ ars , bass , and drums by rock bands .
the Song@@ writers Hall of F@@ ame also induc@@ ted Holly in 1986 , and said his contributions &quot; changed the face of Rock &apos; n &apos; Roll . &quot; Holly developed in collaboration with Pe@@ tty techniques of over@@ du@@ bbing and reverber@@ ation , while he used innovative instrumentation later implemented by other artists .
Holly became &quot; one of the most influential pioneers of rock and roll &quot; who had a &quot; lasting influence &quot; on genre performers of the 1960s .
in 1980 , Grant Speed sculp@@ ted a statue of Holly playing his F@@ ender guitar .
this statue is the center@@ piece of Lub@@ b@@ ock &apos;s Walk of F@@ ame , which honors notable people who contributed to Lub@@ b@@ ock &apos;s musical history .
other memorials to Bud@@ dy Holly include a street named in his honor and the Bud@@ dy Holly Center , which contains a museum of Holly memor@@ abil@@ ia and fine arts gallery .
the Center is located on C@@ ric@@ kets Avenue , one street east of Bud@@ dy Holly Avenue , in a building that previously housed the Fort Wor@@ th and Denver South Plains Railway Depot .
in 1997 , the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences gave Holly the Life@@ time Achievement Award .
Holly was induc@@ ted into the Iowa Rock &apos; n &apos; Roll Hall of F@@ ame in 2000 .
in 2010 , Grant Speed &apos;s statue was taken down for refurbishment and construction of a new Walk of F@@ ame began .
on May 9 , 2011 , the City of Lub@@ b@@ ock held a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony for the Bud@@ dy and Maria Elena Holly Plaza , the new home of the statue and the Walk of F@@ ame .
the same year , a star bearing Holly &apos;s name was placed on the Hollywood Walk of F@@ ame , commemorating his 75th birthday .
groundbreaking was held on April 20 , 2017 , for the construction of a new performing arts center in Lub@@ b@@ ock , the Bud@@ dy Holly Hall of Arts and Sciences , a downtown $ 153 million project expected to be completed in late 2019 .
thus far , the private group , the Lub@@ b@@ ock Entertainment and Performing Arts Association , has raised or received pledges in the amount of $ 93 million to underwrite the project .

teenagers John Len@@ non and Paul McCar@@ tney saw Holly for the first time when he appeared on &quot; Sunday Night at the London P@@ all@@ adium &quot; .
the two had recently met and begun their musical association .
they studied Holly &apos;s records , learned his performance style and ly@@ ric@@ ism , and based their act around his persona .
inspired by Holly &apos;s insect @-@ themed C@@ ric@@ kets , they chose to name their band &quot; The Beatles . &quot; Len@@ non and McCar@@ tney later cited Holly as one of their main influences .
Len@@ non &apos;s band the Quar@@ ry@@ men covered &quot; That &apos;ll Be the Day &quot; in their first recording session , in 1958 .
during breaks in the Beatles &apos; first appearance on &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show &quot; , on February 9 , 1964 , Len@@ non asked CBS coordinator V@@ ic Cal@@ andra about Holly &apos;s performances ;
Cal@@ andra said Len@@ non and McCar@@ tney repeatedly expressed their appreciation of Holly .
the Beatles recorded a close cover of Holly &apos;s version of &quot; Words of Love , &quot; which was released on their 1964 album &quot; Beatles for Sale &quot; .
during the January 1969 recording sessions for their album &quot; Let It Be &quot; , the Beatles played a slow , im@@ promp@@ tu version of &quot; Mail@@ man , Bring Me No More Blu@@ es &quot; - which Holly popularized but did not write - with Len@@ non mim@@ icking Holly &apos;s vocal style .
Len@@ non recorded a cover version of &quot; Peggy Sue &quot; on his 1975 album &quot; Rock &apos; n &apos; Roll &quot; .
McCar@@ tney owns the publishing rights to Holly &apos;s song catalogue .
two nights before Holly &apos;s death , on January 31 , 1959 , 17 @-@ year @-@ old Bob D@@ ylan attended Holly &apos;s performance in Dul@@ uth .
D@@ ylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the Gram@@ my Award for Album of the Year for &quot; Time Out of Mind &quot; in 1998 :
&quot; ... when I was sixteen or seventeen years old , I went to see Bud@@ dy Holly play at Dul@@ uth National Guard Ar@@ mor@@ y and I was three feet away from him ... and he looked at me . and I just have some sort of feeling that he was ... with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way . &quot; M@@ ick Jag@@ ger saw Holly performing live in Wool@@ wich , London , during a tour of England ;
Jag@@ ger particularly remembered Holly &apos;s performance of &quot; Not F@@ ade Away &quot; - a song that also inspired Keith Richards , who modeled his early guitar playing on the track .
the Rolling St@@ ones had a hit version of the song in 1964 .
Richards later said , &quot; &#91; Holly &#93; passed it on via the Beatles and via &#91; the Rolling St@@ ones &#93; ... He &apos;s in everybody . &quot; don Mc@@ Lean &apos;s popular 1971 bal@@ lad &quot; American P@@ ie &quot; was inspired by Holly &apos;s death and the day of the plane crash .
the song &apos;s lyric , which calls the incident &quot; The Day the Music Di@@ ed , &quot; became popularly associated with the crash .
Mc@@ Lean &apos;s album &quot; American P@@ ie &quot; is dedicated to Holly .
in 2015 , Mc@@ Lean wrote , &quot; Bud@@ dy Holly would have the same stature mus@@ ically whether he would have lived or died , because of his accomplishments ... By the time he was 22 years old , he had recorded some 50 tracks , most of which he had written himself ... in my view and the view of many others , a hit ... Bud@@ dy Holly and the C@@ ric@@ kets were the template for all the rock bands that followed . &quot; El@@ ton John was mus@@ ically influenced by Holly .
at age 13 , although he did not require them , John started wearing horn @-@ rim@@ med glasses to imitate Holly .
the Cl@@ ash were also influenced by Holly , and referenced him in their song &quot; Corner Soul &quot; from the &quot; Sand@@ ini@@ sta ! &quot; album . &quot;
the Chir@@ ping C@@ ric@@ kets &quot; was the first album Eric Cl@@ ap@@ ton ever bought ; he later saw Holly on &quot; Sunday Night at the London P@@ all@@ adium &quot; .
in his autobiography , Cl@@ ap@@ ton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his F@@ ender , saying , &quot; I thought I &apos;d died and gone to heaven ... it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself : &apos; that &apos;s the future - that &apos;s what I want &apos; . &quot; the launch of Bobby V@@ ee &apos;s successful musical career resulted from Holly &apos;s death ;
V@@ ee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash .
Holly &apos;s profound influence on V@@ ee &apos;s singing style can be heard in the songs &quot; Rubber Ball &quot; - the B @-@ side of which was a cover of Holly &apos;s &quot; Every@@ day &quot; - and &quot; Run to Him . &quot; the name of the British rock band the Hol@@ lies is often claimed as a tribute to Holly ; according to the band , they admired Holly , but their name was mainly inspired by spri@@ gs of hol@@ ly in evidence around Christmas 1962 .
in an August 24 , 1978 , interview with &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; , Bruce Spring@@ ste@@ en told Dave Marsh , &quot; I play Bud@@ dy Holly every night before I go on ; that keeps me honest . &quot; the Gr@@ at@@ eful Dead performed the song &quot; Not F@@ ade Away &quot; in concerts .
in 2016 , Richard Bar@@ one released his album &quot; Sor@@ rows &amp; Prom@@ ises : Greenwich Village in the 1960s &quot; , paying tribute to the new wave of singer @-@ song@@ writers in the Village during that pivotal , post @-@ Holly era .
the album opens with Bar@@ one &apos;s version of &quot; Learning the Game , &quot; one of the final songs written and recorded by Holly at his home in Greenwich Village , a week before his death .

Bab@@ rak K@@ arm@@ al was an Afghan politician who was installed as President of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union when they invaded in 1979 .
K@@ arm@@ al was born in Kam@@ ari and educated at Kabul University .
when the People &apos;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan was formed , K@@ arm@@ al became one of its leading members , having been introduced to Marxism by Mir Ak@@ bar K@@ hy@@ ber during his imprisonment for activities deemed too radical by the government .
he eventually became the leader of the Par@@ cha@@ m faction when the P@@ DPA split in 1967 , with their ideological n@@ eme@@ sis being the Khal@@ q faction .
under K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s leadership , the Par@@ cham@@ ite P@@ DPA participated in Mohammad Da@@ oud Khan &apos;s rise to power in 1973 , and his subsequent regime .
while relations were good at the beginning , Da@@ oud began a major purge of lef@@ tist influence in the mid @-@ 1970s .
this in turn led to the reformation of the P@@ DPA in 1977 , and K@@ arm@@ al played a major role in the 1978 Sa@@ ur Revolution when the P@@ DPA took power , though in later years he denounced it .
K@@ arm@@ al was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council , synonymous with vice head of state , in the communist government .
the Par@@ cham@@ ite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khal@@ q@@ ists soon after taking power .
in June 1978 , a P@@ DPA Central Committee meeting voted in favor of giving the Khal@@ q@@ ist faction exclusive control over P@@ DPA policy .
this decision was followed by a failed Par@@ cham@@ ite coup , after which Haf@@ iz@@ ullah Amin , a Khal@@ q@@ ist , initiated a purge against the Par@@ cham@@ ites .
K@@ arm@@ al survived this purge but was exiled to Prague .
K@@ arm@@ al remained in exile until December 1979 , when the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan to stabilize the country .
the Soviet troops staged a coup and assassinated Amin .
K@@ arm@@ al had always been highly critical of his Khal@@ q@@ ist predecessors Nur Muhammad Tar@@ aki and Amin &apos;s ultra @-@ left radicalism .
K@@ arm@@ al was promoted to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 27 December 1979 .
he remained in office until 1981 , when he was succeeded by Sultan Ali Kes@@ htm@@ and .
throughout his term , K@@ arm@@ al worked to establish a support base for the P@@ DPA by introducing several reforms .
among these were the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan , introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during Nur Mohammad Tar@@ aki &apos;s and Amin &apos;s rule .
he also replaced the red Khal@@ q@@ ist flag with a more traditional one .
these policies failed to increase the P@@ DPA &apos;s legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people and the mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ deen rebels .
these policy failures , and the stalemate that ensued after the Soviet intervention , led the Soviet leadership to become highly critical of K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s leadership .
under Mikhail Gorbachev , the Soviet Union deposed K@@ arm@@ al in 1986 and replaced him with Mohammad Na@@ ji@@ bullah .
following his loss of power , he was again exiled , this time to Moscow .
it was An@@ ah@@ ita R@@ ate@@ b@@ z@@ ad who persuaded Na@@ ji@@ bullah to allow Bab@@ rak K@@ arm@@ al to return to Afghanistan in 1991 , where K@@ arm@@ al became an associate of Abdul Rashid Do@@ st@@ um and possibly helped remove the Na@@ ji@@ bullah government from power in 1992 .
he eventually left Afghanistan again for Moscow .
not long after , in 1996 , K@@ arm@@ al died from liver cancer .
</p>
<p>
K@@ arm@@ al was born Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929 , was the son of Muhammad Hussein Hash@@ em , a Major General in the Afghan Army and former governor of the province of Pak@@ tia , and was the second of five siblings .
his family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul .
his ethnic background is disputed , some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a G@@ hil@@ zai Pash@@ tun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir .
in 1986 , K@@ arm@@ al announced that he , and his brother Mahmud Bar@@ y@@ al@@ ay , were Pash@@ tun because their mother came from the Mul@@ la@@ k@@ hel branch of the Pash@@ tun@@ s .
however , this was controversial , considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father , not the mother .
the accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry comes from the fact that his birth@@ name , Sultan Hussein , is a common Indian Muslim name .
in addition , K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s own father denied his own ethnicity ; K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s father was a Tajik .
to further confuse the matter , K@@ arm@@ al spoke D@@ ari and not Pash@@ to .
K@@ arm@@ al was born in Kam@@ ari , a village close to Kabul .
he attended Ne@@ j@@ at High School , a German @-@ speaking school , and graduated from it in 1948 , and applied to enter the Faculty of Law and Political Science of Kabul University .
K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s application was turned down because of his student union activities .
he studied at the College of Law and Political Science at Kabul University from 1951 to 1953 .
in 1953 K@@ arm@@ al was arrested because of his student union activities , but was released three years later in 1956 in an amnesty by Muhammad Da@@ oud Khan .
shortly after , in 1957 , K@@ arm@@ al found work as an English and German translator , before quitting and leaving for military training .
K@@ arm@@ al graduated from the College of Law and Political Science in 1960 , and in 1961 , he found work as an employee in the Compilation and Translation Department of the Ministry of Education .
from 1961 to 1963 he worked in the Ministry of Planning .
when his mother died , K@@ arm@@ al left with his maternal aunt to live somewhere else .
his father dis@@ owned him because of his lef@@ tist views .
K@@ arm@@ al was involved in much , which was controversial in the mostly conservative Afghan society .
</p>
<p>
imprisoned from 1953 to 1956 , K@@ arm@@ al be@@ fri@@ ended fellow inmate Mir Ak@@ bar K@@ hy@@ ber , who introduced K@@ arm@@ al to Marxism .
K@@ arm@@ al changed his name from Sultan Hussein to Bab@@ rak K@@ arm@@ al , which means &quot; Comrade of the Workers &apos; &quot; in Pash@@ tun , to dis@@ associate himself from his bourgeois background .
when he was released from prison , he continued his activities in the student union , and began to promote Marxism .
K@@ arm@@ al spent the rest of the 1950s and the early 1960s becoming involved with Marxist organizations , of which there were at least four in Afghanistan at the time ; two of the four were established by K@@ arm@@ al .
when the 1964 Afghan Provisional Constitution , which leg@@ alised the establishment of new political entities , was introduced several prominent Marx@@ ists agreed to establish a communist political party .
the People &apos;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan was established in January 1965 in Nur Muhammad Tar@@ aki &apos;s home .
f@@ action@@ alism within the P@@ DPA quickly became a problem ; the party split into the Khal@@ q led by Tar@@ aki alongside Haf@@ iz@@ ullah Amin , and the Par@@ cha@@ m led by K@@ arm@@ al .
during the 1965 parliamentary election K@@ arm@@ al was one of four P@@ DPA members elected to the lower house of parliament ; the three others were An@@ ah@@ ita R@@ ate@@ b@@ z@@ ad , Nur Ahmed Nur and Fe@@ z@@ anu@@ l Haq Fe@@ zan .
no Khal@@ q@@ ists were elected ; however , Amin was 50 votes short of being elected .
the Par@@ cham@@ ite victory may be explained by the simple fact that K@@ arm@@ al could contribute financially to the P@@ DPA electoral campaign .
K@@ arm@@ al became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s , electing Mohammad Has@@ him Mai@@ w@@ and@@ wal as Prime Minister after a student demonstration concluded with three deaths under the former leadership .
in 1967 , the P@@ DPA un@@ officially split into two formal parties , one Khal@@ q@@ ist and one Par@@ cha@@ mist .
the dissolution of the P@@ DPA was initiated by the closing down of the Khal@@ q@@ ist newspaper , &quot; Khal@@ q &quot; .
K@@ arm@@ al criticised the &quot; Khal@@ q &quot; for being too communist , and believed that its leadership should have hidden its Marxist orientation instead of promoting it .
according to the official version of events , the majority of the P@@ DPA Central Committee rejected K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s criticism .
the vote was a close one , and it is reported that Tar@@ aki expanded the Central Committee to win the vote ; this plan resulted in eight of the new members becoming politically un@@ aligned with and one switching to the Par@@ cham@@ ite side .
K@@ arm@@ al and half the P@@ DPA Central Committee left the P@@ DPA to establish a Par@@ cham@@ ite @-@ led P@@ DPA .
officially the split was caused by ideological differences , but the party may have divided between the different leadership styles and plans of Tar@@ aki versus K@@ arm@@ al .
Tar@@ aki wanted to model the party after Len@@ inist norms while K@@ arm@@ al wanted to establish a democratic front .
other differences were socioeconomic .
the majority of Khal@@ q@@ ists came from rural areas ; hence they were poorer , and were of Pash@@ tun origin .
the Par@@ cham@@ ites were urban , richer , and spoke D@@ ari more often than not .
the Khal@@ q@@ ists accused the Par@@ cham@@ ites of having a connection with the monarchy , and because of it , referred to the Par@@ cham@@ ite P@@ DPA as the &quot; Royal Communist Party . &quot; both K@@ arm@@ al and Amin retained their seats in the lower house of parliament in the 1969 parliamentary election .
</p>
<p>
Mohammed Da@@ oud Khan , in collaboration with the Par@@ cham@@ ite P@@ DPA and radical military officers , overthrew the monarchy and instituted the Afghan Republic in 1973 .
after Da@@ oud &apos;s seizure of power , an American embassy cable stated that the new government had established a Soviet @-@ style Central Committee , in which K@@ arm@@ al and Mir Ak@@ bar K@@ hy@@ ber were given leading positions .
most ministries were given to Par@@ cham@@ ites ; Hassan Shar@@ q became Deputy Prime Minister , Major Fa@@ iz Mohammad became Minister of Internal Affairs and Nem@@ at@@ ullah P@@ az@@ h@@ wa@@ k became Minister of Education .
the Par@@ cham@@ ites took control over the ministries of finance , agriculture , communications and border affairs .
the new government quickly suppressed the opposition , and secured their power base .
at first , the National Front government between Da@@ oud and the Par@@ cham@@ ites seemed to work .
by 1975 , Da@@ oud had strengthened his position by enhancing the executive , legislative and judicial powers of the Presidency .
to the dismay of the Par@@ cham@@ ites , all parties other than the National Revolutionary Party were made illegal .
shortly after the ban on opposition to the N@@ RP , Da@@ oud began a massive purge of Par@@ cham@@ ites in government .
Mohammad lost his position as interior minister , Abdul Qad@@ ir was dem@@ oted , and K@@ arm@@ al was put under government surveillance .
to mitigate Da@@ oud &apos;s suddenly anti @-@ communist directives , the Soviet Union re@@ established the P@@ DPA ;
Tar@@ aki was elected its General Secretary and K@@ arm@@ al , Second Secretary .
while the Sa@@ ur Revolution was planned for August , the assassination of K@@ hy@@ ber led to a chain of events which ended with the commun@@ ists seizing power .
K@@ arm@@ al , when taking power in 1979 , accused Amin of ordering the assassination of K@@ hy@@ ber .
</p>
<p>
Tar@@ aki was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council and Chairman of the Council of Ministers , retaining his post as P@@ DPA general secretary .
Tar@@ aki initially formed a government which consisted of both Khal@@ q@@ ists and Par@@ cham@@ ites ;
K@@ arm@@ al became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council , while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Mini@@ ster@@ s.@@ Mohammad As@@ lam Wat@@ anj@@ ar became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers .
the two Par@@ cham@@ ites Abdul Qad@@ ir and Mohammad Rafi , became Minister of Defence and Minister of Public Works , respectively .
the appointment of Amin , K@@ arm@@ al and Wat@@ anj@@ ar led to splits within the Council of Ministers : the Khal@@ q@@ ists answered to Amin ; K@@ arm@@ al led the civilian Par@@ cham@@ ites ; and the military officers were answerable to Wat@@ anj@@ ar .
the first conflict arose when the Khal@@ q@@ ists wanted to give P@@ DPA Central Committee membership to military officers who had participated in the Sa@@ ur Revolution ; K@@ arm@@ al opposed such a move but was overruled .
a P@@ DPA Polit@@ bur@@ o meeting voted in favour of giving Central Committee membership to the officers .
on 27 June , three months after the Sa@@ ur Revolution , Amin out@@ maneu@@ vered the Par@@ cham@@ ites at a Central Committee meeting , giving the Khal@@ q@@ ists exclusive right over formulating and deciding policy .
a purge against the Par@@ cham@@ ites was initiated by Amin and supported by Tar@@ aki on 1 July 1979 .
K@@ arm@@ al , fearing for his safety , went into hiding in one of his Soviet friends &apos; homes .
K@@ arm@@ al tried to contact Alexander Pu@@ z@@ anov , the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan , to talk about the situation .
Pu@@ z@@ anov refused , and revealed K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s location to Amin .
it should be noted that the Soviets probably saved K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s life by sending him to the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia .
in exile , K@@ arm@@ al established a network with the remaining Par@@ cham@@ ites in government .
a coup to overthrow Amin was planned for 4 September 1979 .
its leading members in Afghanistan were Qad@@ ir and the Army Chief of Staff General Shah@@ pur Ahmed@@ zai .
the coup was planned for the Festival of Eid , in anticipation of relaxed military vigilance .
the conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan .
another purge was initiated , and Par@@ cham@@ ite ambassadors were recalled .
few returned to Afghanistan ; K@@ arm@@ al and Mohammad Na@@ ji@@ bullah stayed in their respective countries .
the Soviets decided that Amin should be removed to make way for a K@@ arm@@ al @-@ Tar@@ aki coalition government .
however Amin managed to order the arrest and later the murder of Tar@@ aki .
Amin was informed of the Soviet decision to intervene in Afghanistan and was initially supportive , but was assassinated .
under the command of the Soviets , K@@ arm@@ al ascended to power .
on 27 December 1979 , K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s pre @-@ recorded speech to the Afghan people was broadcast via Radio Kabul from Tashkent in the Uzbek SSR , saying :
&quot; today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed , his accomplices - the primitive execu@@ tioners , usur@@ pers and murderers of tens of thousand of our fellow countrymen - fathers , mothers , sisters , brothers , sons and daughters , children and old people ... &quot; K@@ arm@@ al was not in Kabul when the speech was broadcast ; he was in Bag@@ ram , protected by the KGB .
that evening Yuri An@@ dro@@ po@@ v , the Chairman of the KGB , congratulated K@@ arm@@ al on his rise to the Chairmanship of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council , some time before K@@ arm@@ al received an official appointment .
K@@ arm@@ al returned to Kabul on 28 December .
he travelled alongside a Soviet military column .
for the next few days K@@ arm@@ al lived in a villa on the outskirts of Kabul under the protection of the KGB .
on 1 January 1980 Leonid Bre@@ z@@ hn@@ ev , the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , and Alex@@ ei Ko@@ sy@@ gin , the Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers , congratulated K@@ arm@@ al on his &quot; election &quot; as leader .
</p>
<p>
when he came to power , K@@ arm@@ al promised an end to executions , the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections , the creation of a constitution , and legalization of alternative political parties .
prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general amnesty .
he promised the creation of a coalition government which would not espouse socialism .
at the same time , he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic , military and political assistance .
the mistrust most Afghans felt towards the government was a problem for K@@ arm@@ al .
many still remembered he had said he would protect private capital in 1978 - a promise later proven to be a lie .
K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s three most important promises were the general amnesty of prisoners , the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the adoption of a new flag containing the traditional black , red and green .
his government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property .
some property , which was confiscated during earlier land reforms , was also partially restored .
all these measures , with the exception of the general amnesty of prisoners , were introduced gradually .
of 2,700 prisoners , 2,600 were released from prison ; 600 of these were Par@@ cham@@ ites .
the general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government .
while the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some , many others greeted the event with disdain , since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier pur@@ ges .
Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980 , to coincide with the P@@ DPA &apos;s sixteenth anniversary .
work on the Fundamental Principles had started under Amin : it guaranteed democratic rights such as freedom of speech , the right to security and life , the right to peaceful association , the right to demonstrate and the right that &quot; no one would be accused of crime but in accord with the provisions of law &quot; and that the accused had the right to a fair trial .
the Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the P@@ DPA , the only party then permitted by law .
the Revolutionary Council , the organ of supreme power , would convene twice every year .
the Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session .
the Presidium consisted mostly of P@@ DPA Polit@@ bur@@ o members .
the state would safeguard three kinds of property : State , cooperative and private property .
the Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy were man was free .
another clause stated that the state had the right to take &quot; families , both parents and children , under its supervision . &quot; while it looked democratic at the outset , the Fundamental Principles was based on contradictions .
the Fundamental Principles led to the establishment of two important state organs : the Special Revolutionary Court , a specialized court for crimes against national security and territorial integrity , and the Institute for Legal and Scientific Research and Legislative Affairs , the supreme legislative organ of state , This body could amend and draft laws , and introduce regulations and decrees on behalf of the government .
the introduction of more Soviet @-@ style institutions led the Afghan people to distrust the communist government even more .
</p>
<p>
with K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s ascension to power , Par@@ cham@@ ites began to &quot; settle old scores . &quot; revolutionary Tro@@ ik@@ as were created to arrest , sentence and execute people .
Amin &apos;s guard were the first victims of the terror which ensued .
those commanders who had stayed loyal to Amin were arrested , filling the prisons .
the Soviets protested , and K@@ arm@@ al replied , &quot; As long as you keep my hands bound and do not let me deal with the Khal@@ q faction there will be no unity in the P@@ DPA and the government cannot become strong ... They tortured and killed us . they still hate us ! they are the enemies of the party ... &quot; Amin &apos;s daughter , along with her baby , was imprisoned for twelve years , until Mohammad Na@@ ji@@ bullah , then leader of the P@@ DPA , released her .
when K@@ arm@@ al took power , leading posts in the Party and Government bureaucracy were taken over by Par@@ cham@@ ites .
the Khal@@ q faction was removed from power , and only technocr@@ ats , opport@@ unists and individuals which the Soviets trusted would be appointed to the higher echelons of government .
Khal@@ q@@ ists remained in control of the Ministry of Interior , but Par@@ cham@@ ites were given control over K@@ HAD and the secret police .
the Par@@ cham@@ ites and the Khal@@ q@@ ists controlled an equal share of the military .
two out of K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s three Council of Ministers deputy chairmen were Khal@@ q@@ ists .
Khal@@ q@@ ists controlled the Ministry of Communications and the interior ministry .
Par@@ cham@@ ites , on the other hand , controlled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence .
in addition to the changes in government , the Par@@ cham@@ ites held clear majority in the P@@ DPA Central Committee .
only one Khal@@ qi , Saleh Mohammad Z@@ ear@@ y , was a member of the P@@ DPA Secretariat during K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s rule .
over 14 and 15 March 1982 the P@@ DPA held a party &quot; conference &quot; at the Kabul Polytechnic Institute instead of a party &quot; congress &quot; , since a party congress would have given the Khal@@ q faction a majority and could have led to a Khal@@ q@@ ist takeover of the P@@ DPA .
the rules of holding a party conference were different , and the Par@@ cham@@ ites had a three @-@ fifths majority .
this infuri@@ ated several Khal@@ q@@ ists ; the threat of expulsion did not lessen their anger .
the conference was not successful , but it was portrayed as such by the official media .
the conference broke up after one and a half days of a 3 @-@ day long program , because of the inter @-@ party struggle for power between the Khal@@ q@@ ists and the Par@@ cham@@ ites .
a &quot; program of action &quot; was introduced , and party rules were given minor changes .
as an explanation of the low party membership , the official media also made it seem hard to become a member of the party .
</p>
<p>
when K@@ arm@@ al took power , he began expanding the support base of the P@@ DPA .
K@@ arm@@ al tried to persuade certain groups , which had been referred to class enemies of the revolution during Tar@@ aki and Amin &apos;s rule , to support the P@@ DPA .
K@@ arm@@ al appointed several non @-@ commun@@ ists to top positions .
between March and May 1980 , 78 out of the 191 people appointed to government posts were not members of the P@@ DPA .
K@@ arm@@ al reintroduced the old Afghan custom of having an Islamic invocation every time the government issued a proclamation .
in his first live speech to the Afghan people , K@@ arm@@ al called for the establishment of the National Fa@@ therland Front ; the N@@ FF &apos;s founding congress was held in June 1981 .
unfortunately for K@@ arm@@ al , his policies did not lead to a notable increase in support for his regime , and it did not help K@@ arm@@ al that most Afghans saw the Soviet intervention as an invasion .
by 1981 , the government gave up on political solutions to the conflict .
at the fifth P@@ DPA Central Committee plen@@ um in June , K@@ arm@@ al resigned from his Council of Ministers chairmanship and was replaced by Sultan Ali Kes@@ htm@@ and , while Nur Ahmad Nur was given a bigger role in the Revolutionary Council .
this was seen as &quot; base broadening . &quot; the previous weight given to non @-@ P@@ DPA members in top positions ceased to be an important matter in the media by June 1981 .
this was significant , considering that up to five members of the Revolutionary Council were non @-@ P@@ DPA members .
by the end of 1981 , the previous contenders , who had been heavily presented in the media , were all gone ; two were given ambass@@ ador@@ ships , two ceased to be active in politics , and one continued as an advisor to the government .
the other three changed sides , and began to work for the opposition .
the national policy of reconciliation continued : in January 1984 the land reform introduced by Tar@@ aki and Amin was drastically modified , the limits of land@@ holdings were increased to win the support of middle class peasants , the literacy programme was continued , and concessions to women were made .
in 1985 the Loya Jirga was reconvened .
the 1985 Loya Jirga was followed by a tribal j@@ irga in September .
in 1986 Abdul Ra@@ him Hat@@ ef , a non @-@ P@@ DPA member , was elected to the N@@ FF chairmanship .
during the 1985 @-@ 86 elections it was said that 60 percent of the elected officials were non @-@ P@@ DPA members .
by the end of K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s rule , several non @-@ P@@ DPA members had high @-@ level government positions .
</p>
<p>
in March 1979 , the military budget was 6.4 million US $ , which was 8.3 percent of the government budget , but only 2.2 of gross national product .
after the Soviet intervention , the defence budget increased to 208 million US $ in 1980 , and 325 million US $ by 1981 .
in 1982 it was reported that the government spent around 22 percent of total expenditure .
when the political solution failed , the Afghan government and the Soviet military decided to solve the conflict militarily .
the change from a political to a military solution did not come suddenly .
it began in January 1981 , as K@@ arm@@ al doubled wages for military personnel , issued several promotions , and decorated one general and thirteen colon@@ els .
the draft age was lowered , the obligatory length of arms duty was extended and the age for reser@@ vists was increased to thirty @-@ five years of age .
in June 1981 , Ass@@ adul@@ lah Sar@@ w@@ ari lost his seat in the P@@ DPA Polit@@ bur@@ o , replaced by Mohammad As@@ lam Wat@@ anj@@ ar , a former tank commander and Minister of Communications , Major General Mohammad Rafi was mad@@ e@@ Minister of Defence and Mohammad Na@@ ji@@ bullah appointed K@@ HAD Chairman .
these measures were introduced due to the collapse of the army during the Soviet intervention .
before the invasion the army could field 100,000 troops , after the invasion only 25,000 .
deser@@ tions were pandemic , and the recruitment campaigns for young people often drove them to the opposition .
to better organize the military , seven military zones were established , each with its own Defence Council .
the Defence Councils were established at the national , provincial and district level to empower the local P@@ DPA .
it is estimated that the Afghan government spent as much as 40 percent of government revenue on defense .
</p>
<p>
during the civil war and the ensuing Soviet @-@ Afghan War , most of the country &apos;s infrastructure was destroyed .
normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted .
the Gross national product fell substantially during K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s rule because of the conflict ; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital .
in 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 15@@ 4.3 billion Afghan af@@ gh@@ anis , a drop from 15@@ 9.7 billion in 1978 .
GNP per capita decreased from 7,@@ 370 in 1978 to 6,@@ 852 in 1981 .
the dominant form of economic activity was in the agricultural sector .
agriculture accounted for 63 percent of gross domestic product in 1981 ; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982 .
industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982 , and employed 10 percent of the labor force .
all industrial enterprises were government @-@ owned .
the service sector , the smallest of the three , accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981 , and employed an estimated one @-@ third of the labour force .
the balance of payments , which had grown in the pre @-@ communist administration of Muhammad Da@@ oud Khan , decreased , turning negative by 1982 at 7@@ 0.3 million $ US .
the only economic activity which grew substantially during K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s rule was export and import .
</p>
<p>
K@@ arm@@ al observed in early 1983 that without Soviet intervention , &quot; It is unknown what the destiny of the Afghan Revolution would be ... We are re@@ alists and we clearly realize that in store for us yet lie trials and deprivations , losses and difficulties . &quot; two weeks before this statement Sultan Ali Kes@@ htm@@ and , the Chairman of the Council of Ministers , lamented the fact that half the schools and three @-@ quarters of communications had been destroyed since 1979 .
the Soviet Union rejected several Western @-@ made peace plans , such as the Carr@@ ington Plan , since they did not take into consideration the P@@ DPA government .
most Western peace plans had been made in collaboration with the Afghan opposition forces .
at the 26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Leonid Bre@@ z@@ hn@@ ev , the General Secretary of the CP@@ SU Central Committee , stated ;
we do not object to the questions connected with Afghanistan being discussed in conjunction with the question of security in the Persian Gulf .
naturally here on only the international aspects of the Afghan problem can be discussed , not internal Afghan affairs .
the sovereignty of Afghanistan must be fully protected , as must its non@@ aligned status .
the stance of the Pakistani government was clear , demanding complete Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the establishment of a non @-@ P@@ DPA government .
K@@ arm@@ al , summarizing his discussions with Iran and Pakistan , said &quot; Iran and Pakistan have so far not opted for concrete and constructive positions . &quot; during K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s rule Afghan @-@ Pakistani relations remained hostile ; the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was the catalyst for the hostile relationship .
the increasing numbers of Afghan refugees in Pakistan challenged the P@@ DPA &apos;s legitimacy to rule .
the Soviet Union threatened in 1985 that it would support the Balo@@ ch separatist movement in Pakistan if the Pakistani government continued to aid the mu@@ ja@@ hi@@ deen in Afghanistan .
K@@ arm@@ al , problem@@ atically for the Soviets , did not want a Soviet withdrawal , and he hampered attempts to improve relations with Pakistan since the Pakistani government had refused to recognise the P@@ DPA government .
</p>
<p>
Mikhail Gorbachev , then General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , said , &quot; The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade K@@ arm@@ al is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help . &quot; K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s position became less secure when the Soviet leadership began blaming him for the failures in Afghanistan .
Gorbachev , worried over the situation , told the Soviet Polit@@ bur@@ o &quot; If we don &apos;t change approaches &#91; to evacuate Afghanistan &#93; , we will be fighting there for another 20 or 30 years . &quot; it is not clear when the Soviet leadership began to campaign for K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s dismissal , but Andrei G@@ rom@@ y@@ ko discussed the possibility of K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s resignation with Javier Pérez de Cu@@ él@@ lar , the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations in 1982 .
while it was Gorbachev who would dismiss K@@ arm@@ al , there may have been a consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that K@@ arm@@ al should resign .
Gorbachev &apos;s own plan was to replace K@@ arm@@ al with Mohammad Na@@ ji@@ bullah , who had joined the P@@ DPA at its creation .
Na@@ ji@@ bullah was thought highly of by Yuri An@@ dro@@ po@@ v , Boris P@@ onom@@ are@@ v and Dmit@@ ri@@ y U@@ stin@@ ov , and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983 .
Na@@ ji@@ bullah was not the Soviet leadership &apos;s only choice for K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s succession ; a GR@@ U report noted that the majority of the P@@ DPA leadership would support Ass@@ adul@@ lah Sar@@ w@@ ari &apos;s ascension to leadership .
according to the GR@@ U , Sar@@ w@@ ari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pash@@ tun@@ s , Taji@@ ks and Uzbe@@ ks ; Na@@ ji@@ bullah was a Pash@@ tun nationalist .
another viable candidate was Abdul Qad@@ ir , who had been a participant in the Sa@@ ur Revolution .
Na@@ ji@@ bullah was appointed to the P@@ DPA Secretariat in November 1985 .
during K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s March 1986 visit to the Soviet Union , the Soviets tried to persuade K@@ arm@@ al that he was too ill to govern , and that he should resign .
this back@@ fired , as a Soviet doctor attending to K@@ arm@@ al told him he was in good health .
K@@ arm@@ al asked to return home to Kabul , and said that he understood and would listen to the Soviet recommendations .
before leaving , K@@ arm@@ al promised he would step down as P@@ DPA General Secretary .
the Soviets did not trust him and sent Vladimir K@@ ry@@ uch@@ kov , the head of intelligence in the KGB , into Afghanistan .
at a meeting in Kabul , K@@ arm@@ al confessed his und@@ ying love for the Soviet Union , comparing his ard@@ or to his Muslim faith .
K@@ ry@@ uch@@ kov , concluding that he could not persuade K@@ arm@@ al to resign , left the meeting .
after K@@ ry@@ uch@@ kov left the room , the Afghan defence minister and the state security minister visited K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s office , telling him that he had to resign from one of his posts .
understanding that his Soviet support had been eliminated , K@@ arm@@ al resigned from the office of the General Secretary at the 18th P@@ DPA Central Committee plen@@ um .
he was succeeded in his post by Na@@ ji@@ bullah .
K@@ arm@@ al still had support within the party , and used his base to curb Na@@ ji@@ bullah &apos;s powers .
he began spreading rumors that he would be reappointed General Secretary .
Na@@ ji@@ bullah &apos;s power base was in the K@@ HAD , the Afghan equivalent to the KGB , and not the party .
considering the fact that the Soviet Union had supported K@@ arm@@ al for over six years , the Soviet leadership wanted to ease him out of power gradually .
Y@@ uli Vorontsov , the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan , told Na@@ ji@@ bullah to begin undermining K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s power slowly .
Na@@ ji@@ bullah complained to the Soviet leadership that K@@ arm@@ al used most of his spare time looking for errors and &quot; speaking against the National Reconciliation &#91; programme &#93; . &quot; at a meeting of the Soviet Polit@@ bur@@ o on 13 November 1986 it was decided that Na@@ ji@@ bullah should remove K@@ arm@@ al ; this motion was supported by G@@ rom@@ y@@ ko , Vorontsov , Edu@@ ard Shev@@ ard@@ nad@@ ze , Anatol@@ y Dob@@ r@@ yn@@ in and Viktor Che@@ bri@@ kov .
a P@@ DPA meeting in November relieved K@@ arm@@ al of his Revolutionary Council chairmanship , and exiled him to Moscow where he was given a state @-@ owned apartment and a d@@ acha .
K@@ arm@@ al was succeeded as Revolutionary Council chairman by Haji Mohammad Cham@@ k@@ ani , who was not a member of the P@@ DPA .
</p>
<p>
many years after the end of his Presidency , he denounced the Sa@@ ur Revolution of 1978 in which he took part , taking aim at the Khal@@ q governments of Tar@@ aki and Amin .
he told a Russian reporter : it was the greatest crime against the people of Afghanistan .
Par@@ cha@@ m &apos;s leaders were against armed actions because the country was not ready for a revolution ...
I knew that people would not support us if we decided to keep power without such support .
for unknown reasons , K@@ arm@@ al was invited back to Kabul by Na@@ ji@@ bullah , and &quot; for equally obscure reasons K@@ arm@@ al accepted , &quot; returning on June 20 , 1991 .. &#91; If Na@@ ji@@ bullah &apos;s plan was to strengthen his position within the Wat@@ an Party by appe@@ asing the pro @-@ K@@ arm@@ al Par@@ cham@@ ites , he failed - K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s apartment became a center for opposition to Na@@ ji@@ bullah &apos;s government .
when Na@@ ji@@ bullah was toppled in 1992 , K@@ arm@@ al became the most powerful politician in Kabul through leadership of the Par@@ cha@@ m .
however , his negotiations with the rebels collapsed quickly , and on 16 April 1992 the rebels , led by Gul@@ bud@@ din He@@ k@@ mat@@ yar , took Kabul .
after the fall of Na@@ ji@@ bullah &apos;s government , K@@ arm@@ al was based in H@@ air@@ atan .
there , it is alleged , K@@ arm@@ al used most of his time either trying to establish a new party , or advising people to join the National Islamic Movement .
Abdul Rashid Do@@ st@@ um , the leader of Jun@@ bish @-@ i @-@ Mil@@ li , was a supporter of K@@ arm@@ al during his rule .
it is unknown how much control K@@ arm@@ al had over Do@@ st@@ um , but there is little evidence that K@@ arm@@ al was in any commanding position .
K@@ arm@@ al &apos;s influence over Do@@ st@@ um appeared indirect - some of his former associates supported Do@@ st@@ um .
those who spoke with K@@ arm@@ al during this period noted his lack of interest in politics .
in June 1992 it was reported that he had died in a plane crash along with Do@@ st@@ um , although these reports later proved to be false .
in early December 1996 , K@@ arm@@ al died in Moscow &apos;s Central Clinical Hospital from liver cancer .
the date of his death was reported by some sources as 1 December and by others as 3 December .
the Taliban summed up his rule as follows : &#91; he &#93; committed all kinds of crimes during his illegitimate rule ...
God inflicted on him various kinds of hardship and pain .
eventually he died of cancer in a hospital belonging to his pay@@ masters , the Russians .

the Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Haw@@ thorne , California , in 1961 .
the group &apos;s original lineup consisted of brothers Brian , Dennis , and Carl Wilson , their cousin Mike Love , and their friend Al J@@ ard@@ ine .
distinguished by their vocal harmon@@ ies and early surf songs , they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era .
the band drew on the music of jazz @-@ based vocal groups , 1950s rock and roll , and black R &amp; B to create their unique sound .
with Brian as composer , arran@@ ger , producer , and de facto leader , they often incorporated classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways .
the Beach Boys began as an early garage band led by Brian and managed by the Wil@@ sons &apos; father Mur@@ ry .
in 1963 , the band gained national prominence with a string of top @-@ ten singles reflecting a southern California youth culture of surfing , cars , and romance , later dubbed the &quot; California Sound . &quot; after 1964 , they abandoned be@@ ach@@ going themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestr@@ ations .
in 1966 , the &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; album and &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations &quot; single raised the group &apos;s prestige as rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the nascent counter@@ culture era .
following the dissolution of the group &apos;s &quot; S@@ mile &quot; project in 1967 , Brian gradually ceded production and song@@ writing duties to the rest of the band , reducing his input because of mental health and substance abuse issues .
the group &apos;s commercial momentum subsequently faltered , and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound , they were dismissed by early rock critics as the archet@@ yp@@ al &quot; pop music cop @-@ outs . &quot; Carl took over as the band &apos;s musical leader until the late 1970s .
during this period the group scored few commercial hits but released a series of critically @-@ acclaimed albums , notably 1970 &apos;s &quot; Sun@@ flower &quot; and 1971 &apos;s &quot; Sur@@ f &apos;s Up &quot; .
as the 1970s wore on , personal struggles , creative disagreements , and the continued success of the band &apos;s greatest hits albums precipitated their transition into an ol@@ dies act .
since the 1980s , much @-@ publicized legal wran@@ gling over royalties , song@@ writing credits and use of the band &apos;s name transpired .
Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998 .
after Carl &apos;s death , the group &apos;s corporation , Brother Records Inc , allowed Love to lead a touring band under the &quot; Beach Boys &quot; name .
even though they have not performed together since their 2012 reunion tour , Brian , J@@ ard@@ ine , and Love remain a part of B@@ RI and as official members of the band .
the Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed , commercially successful , and influential bands of all time .
they were one of the earliest self @-@ contained rock bands and one of the few US bands who maintained their success before , during and after the 1964 British Inv@@ asion .
between the 1960s and 201@@ 0s , they had over eighty songs chart worldwide , thirty @-@ six of them in the US Top 40 charts , and four reaching number @-@ one on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 chart .
they have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide , making them one of the world &apos;s best @-@ selling bands of all time and are listed at No. 12 on &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; magazine &apos;s 2004 list of the &quot; 100 Great@@ est Artists of All Time . &quot; in 2017 , a study of All@@ Music &apos;s catalog indicated the Beach Boys as the 6th most frequently cited artist influence in its database .
the core quin@@ tet of the three Wil@@ sons , Love and J@@ ard@@ ine was induc@@ ted into the Rock and Roll Hall of F@@ ame in 1988 .

at the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20 , 1958 , Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers , Dennis and Carl - aged thirteen and eleven , respectively - in their family home in Haw@@ thorne .
he had watched his father , Mur@@ ry Wilson , play piano , and had listened intently to the harmon@@ ies of vocal groups such as the Four Fresh@@ men .
after dissec@@ ting songs such as &quot; Ivory Tower &quot; and &quot; Good News , &quot; Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmon@@ ies .
for his birthday that year , Brian received a reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape recorder .
he learned how to over@@ du@@ b , using his voc@@ als and those of Carl and their mother .
Brian played piano with Carl and David Marks , an eleven @-@ year @-@ old longtime neighbor , playing guit@@ ars they had each received as Christmas presents .
soon Brian and Carl were avi@@ dly listening to Johnny O@@ tis &apos; K@@ FO@@ X radio show .
inspired by the simple structure and voc@@ als of the rhythm and blues songs he heard , Brian changed his piano @-@ playing style and started writing songs .
family gatherings brought the Wil@@ sons in contact with cousin Mike Love .
Brian taught Love &apos;s sister Mau@@ reen and a friend harmon@@ ies .
later , Brian , Love and two friends performed at Haw@@ thorne High School .
Brian also knew Al J@@ ard@@ ine , a high school classmate .
Brian suggested to J@@ ard@@ ine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl .
love gave the fledgling band its name : &quot; the Pend@@ let@@ ones , &quot; a pun on &quot; Pend@@ leton , &quot; a style of woolen shirt popular at the time .
Dennis was the only avid sur@@ fer in the group , and he suggested that the group write songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that it had inspired in Southern California .
Brian finished the song , titled &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; , &quot; and with Mike Love , wrote &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; Saf@@ ari . &quot; Mur@@ ry recalled , &quot; They had written a song called &apos; Sur@@ fin &apos; , &apos; which I never did like and still don &apos;t like , it was so rude and crude . &quot; Mur@@ ry Wilson , who was a sometime song@@ writer , arranged for the Pend@@ let@@ ones to meet his publisher H@@ ite Morgan .
he said : &quot; finally , &#91; H@@ ite &#93; agreed to hear it , and Mrs. Morgan said &apos; Drop everything , we &apos;re going to record your song . I think it &apos;s good . &apos; and she &apos;s the one responsible . &quot; on September 15 , 1961 , the band recorded a demo of &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; &quot; with the M@@ organs .
a more professional recording was made on October 3 , at World Pacific Studio in Hollywood .
David Marks was not present at the session as he was in school that day .
Mur@@ ry brought the dem@@ os to Her@@ b New@@ man , owner of Candi@@ x Records and Era Records , and he signed the group on December 8 .
when the single was released a few weeks later , the band found that they had been renamed &quot; the Beach Boys . &quot; Candi@@ x wanted to name the group the Sur@@ fers until Rus@@ s Reg@@ an , a young promoter with Era Records , noted that there already existed a group by that name .
he suggested calling them the Beach Boys .
&quot; Sur@@ fin &quot; was a regional success for the West Coast , and reached number 75 on the national &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 chart .
it was so successful that the number of unpaid orders for the single bank@@ rupted Candi@@ x .
</p>
<p>
by this time the de facto manager of the Beach Boys , Mur@@ ry landed the group &apos;s first paying gig on New Year &apos;s Eve , 1961 , at the Rit@@ chi@@ e Val@@ ens Memorial Dance in Long Beach .
in their earliest public appearances , the band wore heavy wool jacket @-@ like shirts that local sur@@ fers favored before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants .
in early 1962 , Morgan requested that some of the members add voc@@ als to a couple of instrumental tracks that he had recorded with other musicians .
this led to the creation of the short @-@ lived group Kenny &amp; the Cad@@ ets , which Brian led under the pseud@@ onym &quot; Kenny . &quot; the other members were Carl , J@@ ard@@ ine , and the Wil@@ sons &apos; mother Aud@@ ree .
in February , J@@ ard@@ ine left the Beach Boys to study dentistry and was replaced by David Marks .
Mur@@ ry remembered that after &quot; Sur@@ fin , &quot; the group had a difficult time being picked up by another label ;
&quot; they &#91; all &#93; thought &#91; the group was &#93; a one @-@ shot record . &quot; after being turned down by D@@ ot and Liberty , the Beach Boys signed a seven @-@ year contract with Capitol Records .
this was at the urging of Capitol executive and staff producer Nick Ven@@ et who signed the group , seeing them as the &quot; teenage gold &quot; he had been sc@@ outing for .
on June 4 , 1962 , the Beach Boys debu@@ ted on Capitol with their second single , &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; Saf@@ ari &quot; backed with &quot; 409 . &quot; the release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; , which praised Love &apos;s lead vocal and said the song had potential .
&quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; Saf@@ ari &quot; rose to number 14 and found air@@ play in New York and Phoenix , a surprise for the label .
the Beach Boys completed their first album , &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; Saf@@ ari &quot; , with production credited to Nick Ven@@ et .
Carl later denied that Ven@@ et had any significant role in the group &apos;s early music , saying that Ven@@ et &quot; would be in the booth , and he would call the take number , and that was about it . I wouldn &apos;t call him a musical heavy by any ... Brian didn &apos;t want anything to do with Ven@@ et . &quot; &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; Saf@@ ari &quot; , released in October 1962 , was different from other rock albums of the time in that it consisted almost entirely of original songs , primarily written by Brian with Mike Love and friend Gary U@@ sher .
another unusual feature of the Beach Boys was that , although they were marketed as &quot; surf music , &quot; their repertoire bore little resemblance to the music of other surf bands , which was mainly instrumental and incorporated heavy use of spring rever@@ b .
for this reason , some of the Beach Boys &apos; early local performances had young audience members throwing vegetables at the band , believing that the group were pos@@ eurs .
in January 1963 , the Beach Boys recorded their first top @-@ ten single , &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; U.S.A. , &quot; which began their long run of highly successful recording efforts .
it was during the sessions for this single that Brian made the production decision from that point on to use double tracking on the group &apos;s voc@@ als , resulting in a deeper and more resonant sound .
the album of the same name followed in March and reached number 2 on the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; charts .
its success propelled the group into a nationwide spotlight , and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze , albeit the Beach Boys &apos; vocal approach to the genre , not the original instrumental style pioneered by Dick Dale .
bi@@ ographer Luis Sanchez highlights the &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; U.S.A. &quot; single as a turning point for the band , &quot; cre@@ at &#91; ing &#93; a direct passage to California life for a wide teenage audience ... &#91; and &#93; a distinct Southern California sensibility that exceeded its conception as such to advance right to the front of American consciousness . &quot; five days prior to the release of the &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; U.S.A. &quot; album , Brian produced &quot; Sur@@ f City , &quot; a song he had written for Jan and Dean .
&quot; surf City &quot; reached number one on the Bill@@ board charts in July , a development that pleased Brian but angered Mur@@ ry , who felt his son had &quot; given away &quot; what should have been the Beach Boys &apos; first chart @-@ top@@ per .
throughout 1963 , and for the next few years , Brian produced a variety of singles for outside artists .
among these were the Hon@@ e@@ ys , a sur@@ fer trio that comprised sisters Diane and Marilyn R@@ ov@@ ell with cousin G@@ inger Blake .
Brian was convinced that they could potentially be a successful female counterpart to the Beach Boys , and he produced a number of singles for them , although they could not replicate the Beach Boys &apos; popularity .
he also attended some of Phil Spec@@ tor &apos;s sessions at Gold Star Stu@@ di@@ os .
his creative and song@@ writing interests were revamped upon hearing the Ron@@ ettes &apos; 1963 song &quot; Be My Baby , &quot; which was produced by Spec@@ tor .
the first time he heard the song was while driving , and was so overwhelmed that he had to pull over to the side of the road and analyze the chorus .
later , he reflected : &quot; I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spec@@ tor &apos;s work . that was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song . &quot; &quot; sur@@ fer Girl &quot; marked the first time the group used outside musicians on a substantial portion of an LP .
many of them were the musicians Spec@@ tor used for his Wall of Sound productions .
to close 1963 , the band released a standalone Christmas @-@ themed single , &quot; Little Saint Nick , &quot; backed with an a cap@@ p@@ ella rendition of the scrip@@ tural song &quot; The Lord &apos;s Pra@@ yer . &quot; the A @-@ side peaked at No. 3 on the US &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Christmas chart .
</p>
<p>
the surf music craze , along with the careers of nearly all surf acts , was slowly replaced by the British Inv@@ asion .
following a successful Austr@@ al@@ a@@ sian tour in January and February 1964 , the Beach Boys returned home to face their new competition , the Beatles .
both groups shared the same record label in the US , and Capitol &apos;s support for the Beach Boys immediately began waning .
for Brian , the Beatles ultimately &quot; eclip@@ sed a lot &#91; of what &#93; we &apos;d worked for ... &#91; they &#93; eclip@@ sed the whole music world . &quot; Brian wrote his last surf song in April 1964 .
that month , during recording of the single &quot; I Get Around , &quot; Mur@@ ry was relieved of his duties as manager .
he remained in close contact with the group and attempted to continue advising on their career decisions .
when &quot; I Get Around &quot; was released in May , it would climb to number one , their first single to do so , proving that the Beach Boys could compete with contemporary British pop groups .
in July , the album that the song appeared on , &quot; All Summer Long &quot; , reached No. 4 in the US . &quot;
all Summer Long &quot; introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys &apos; sound exemplified by the pic@@ col@@ os and x@@ yl@@ ophon@@ es of its title track .
the album was a swan @-@ song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon .
later albums took a different stylistic and ly@@ rical path .
before this , a live album , &quot; Beach Boys Concert &quot; , was released in October to a four @-@ week chart stay at number one , containing a set list of previously recorded songs and covers that they had not yet recorded .
in June 1964 , Brian recorded the bulk of &quot; The Beach Boys &apos; Christmas Album &quot; with a forty @-@ one @-@ piece studio orchestra in collaboration with Four Fresh@@ men arran@@ ger Dick Reynolds .
the album was a response to Phil Spec@@ tor &apos;s &quot; A Christmas Gift for You &quot; .
released in December , the Beach Boys &apos; album was divided between five new , original Christmas @-@ themed songs , and seven re@@ interpretations of traditional Christmas songs .
it would be regarded as one of the finest holiday albums of the rock era .
one single from the album , &quot; The Man with All the Toys , &quot; was released , peaking at No. 6 on the US &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Christmas chart .
on October 29 , the Beach Boys performed for &quot; The T.@@ A.@@ M.@@ I. Show &quot; , a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of musicians for a one @-@ off performance .
the result was released to movie theaters one month later .
</p>
<p>
by the end of 1964 , the stress of road travel , writing , and producing became too much for Brian .
on December 23 , while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston , he suffered a panic attack only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the musical variety series &quot; Sh@@ indi@@ g ! &quot; .
in January 1965 , he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on song@@ writing and record production .
for the rest of 1964 and into 1965 , session musician Glen Campbell served as Brian &apos;s temporary replacement in concert .
Carl took over as the band &apos;s musical director on@@ stage .
we needed to grow .
up to this point we had mil@@ ked every idea dry .
we mil@@ ked it fucking dry .
we had done every possible angle about surfing and then we did the car routine .
but we needed to grow artis@@ tically .
now a full @-@ time studio artist , Brian wanted to move the Beach Boys beyond their surf aesthetic , believing that their image was antiquated and distracting the public from his talents as a producer and song@@ writer .
in the period following his resignation from touring , Brian put more distance between him and his band@@ mates , and began expanding his social circle to include a mix of worldly @-@ minded friends , musicians , mys@@ tics , and business advisers .
he also took an increasing interest in the developing Los Angeles &quot; hip &quot; scene and in recreational drugs .
mus@@ ically , he said he began to &quot; take the things I learned from Phil Spec@@ tor and use more instruments whenever I could . I doubled up on b@@ asses and tripled up on keyboards , which made everything sound bigger and deeper . &quot; released in March 1965 , &quot; The Beach Boys Today ! &quot; marked the first time the group experimented with the &quot; album @-@ as @-@ art &quot; form .
the tracks on side one feature an up@@ tempo sound that contrasts side two , which consists mostly of emotional ball@@ ads .
music writer Scott Sch@@ inder referenced its &quot; suite @-@ like structure &quot; as an early example of the rock album format being used to make a cohesive artistic statement .
in April 1965 , Campbell &apos;s own career success pulled him from touring with the group .
Columbia Records staff producer Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell ; having failed to find one , Johnston himself became a full @-@ time member of the band on May 19 , 1965 , first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio , beginning with the June 4 vocal sessions for &quot; California Girls , &quot; which first appeared in the band &apos;s next album &quot; Summer Days &quot; and eventually charted at number three in the US while the album went to number two .
the album also included a re@@ worked arrangement of &quot; Help Me , R@@ hon@@ da &quot; which became the band &apos;s second number one single in the spring of 1965 .
to appease Capitol &apos;s demands for a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season , Brian conceived &quot; Beach Boys &apos; Party ! &quot; , a live @-@ in @-@ the @-@ studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R &amp; B songs , in addition to covers of three Beatles songs , Bob D@@ ylan &apos;s &quot; The Times They Are a @-@ Chang@@ in &apos; , &quot; and idiosyn@@ cratic r@@ erec@@ ord@@ ings of the group &apos;s earlier songs .
the album was an early precursor of the &quot; un@@ plugged &quot; trend .
it included a cover of the Reg@@ ents &apos; song &quot; Barbara Ann &quot; which unexpectedly reached number @-@ two when released several weeks later .
in November , the group released another top @-@ twenty single , &quot; The Little Girl I Once K@@ new . &quot; it was considered the band &apos;s most experimental statement thus far .
the single continued Brian &apos;s ambitions for daring arrangements , featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings .
it was the band &apos;s second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough , peaking at number 20 .
according to Luis Sanchez , in 1965 , Bob D@@ ylan was &quot; rewriting the rules for pop success &quot; with his music and image , and it was at this juncture that Wilson &quot; led The Beach Boys into a transitional phase in an effort to win the pop terrain that had been thrown up for grabs . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in January 1966 , Wilson commenced recording sessions for the Beach Boys &apos; forthcoming album &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; , which was largely a collaboration with jing@@ le writer Tony Ash@@ er .
the album was a refinement of the themes and ideas that were introduced in &quot; Today ! &quot; .
in some ways , the music was a jar@@ ring departure from their earlier style .
when the other Beach Boys returned from a three @-@ week tour of Japan and Hawaii , they were presented with a substantial portion of the new album , and various reports suggest that they fought over the new direction .
mus@@ ic@@ ologist Daniel Harrison wrote , &quot; In terms of the structure of the songs themselves , there is comparatively little advance from what Brian had already accomplished . &quot; in &quot; The Journal on the Art of Record Production &quot; , Marshall He@@ iser writes that &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; &quot; diver@@ ges from previous Beach Boys &apos; efforts in several ways : its sound field has a greater sense of depth and &apos; warmth ;
Brian was immediately enam@@ ored with the album , given the impression that it had no filler tracks , a feature that was mostly unheard of at a time when 45 r@@ pm singles were considered more noteworthy than full @-@ length L@@ Ps .
he later said : &quot; it didn &apos;t make me want to copy them but to be as good as them . I didn &apos;t want to do the same kind of music , but on the same level . &quot; thanks to mutual connections , Brian was introduced to the Beatles &apos; former press officer Derek Taylor , who was subsequently employed as the Beach Boys &apos; public@@ ist .
responding to Brian &apos;s request to reinvent the band &apos;s image , Taylor devised a promotion campaign with the tag@@ line &quot; Brian Wilson is a genius , &quot; a belief which Taylor sincerely held .
Taylor &apos;s prestige was crucial in offering a credible perspective to those on the outside , and his efforts are widely recognized as instrumental in the album &apos;s success in Britain .
released on May 16 , 1966 , &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; was widely influential and raised the band &apos;s prestige as an innovative rock group .
early reviews for the album in the US ranged from negative to tentatively positive , and its sales numbered approximately 500,000 units , a slight drop @-@ off from the run of albums that immediately preceded it .
it was assumed that Capitol considered &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; a risk , appealing more to an older demographic than the younger , female audience upon which the Beach Boys had built their commercial standing .
within two months , the label capit@@ ulated by releasing the group &apos;s first greatest hits compilation , &quot; Best of the Beach Boys &quot; , which was quickly certified gold by the R@@ IAA .
by contrast , &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; met a highly favorable critical response in Britain , where it reached number 2 and remained among the top @-@ ten positions for six months .
Paul McCar@@ tney frequently spoke of his affinity with the album , citing &quot; God Only Know@@ s &quot; as his favorite song of all time , and crediting his melo@@ dic bass @-@ playing style to the album .
he acknowledged that &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; was the primary impetus for the Beatles &apos; 1967 album &quot; S@@ g@@ t. Pep@@ per &apos;s Lon@@ ely Hear@@ ts Club Band &quot; .
according to author Car@@ ys W@@ yn Jones , the interplay between these two groups during the &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; era remains one of the most noteworthy episodes in rock history .
in 2003 , when &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; magazine created its list of the &quot; 500 Great@@ est Alb@@ ums of All Time , &quot; the publication placed &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; second to honour its influence on the highest ranked album , &quot; S@@ g@@ t. Pep@@ per &apos;s &quot; .
</p>
<p>
throughout the summer of 1966 , Brian concentrated on finishing the group &apos;s next single , &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations . &quot; during the making of &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; , Wilson started changing his writing process .
rather than going to the studio with a completed song , he would record a track containing a series of chord changes he liked , take an acetate disc home , and then compose the song &apos;s melody and write its lyrics .
with &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations , &quot; Wilson said , &quot; I had a lot of unfinished ideas , fragments of music I called &apos; feels . &apos; each feel represented a mood or an emotion I &apos;d felt , and I planned to fit them together like a mosaic . &quot; most of the song &apos;s structure and arrangement was written as it was recorded .
instead of working on whole songs with clear large @-@ scale syn@@ tactical structures , Brian limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments .
through the method of tape spl@@ icing , each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence , allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time .
coming at a time when pop singles were usually recorded in under two hours , it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken , with sessions for the song stretching over several months in four major Hollywood studios .
it was also the most expensive single ever recorded to that point , with the production costs estimated to be in the tens of thousands .
while in the midst of &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations &quot; sessions , Wilson invited session musician and song@@ writer Van Dy@@ ke Parks to collaborate as ly@@ ric@@ ist for the Beach Boys &apos; next album project , soon titled &quot; S@@ mile &quot; , to which Parks agreed .
Wilson and Parks intended &quot; S@@ mile &quot; to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and mus@@ ically , with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs .
it was explicitly American in style and subject , a conscious reaction to the overwhelming British dominance of popular music at the time .
some of the music incorporated chanting , cowboy songs , explorations in Indian and Hawaiian music , jazz , classical tone poems , cartoon sound effects , &quot; mu@@ si@@ que conc@@ r@@ è@@ te &quot; , and yo@@ del@@ ing . &quot;
Saturday Evening Post &quot; writer Jules Si@@ egel famously recalled that , during one evening in October , Brian announced to his wife and friends that he was &quot; writing a teenage symphony to God . &quot; Brian told &quot; Mel@@ ody M@@ aker &quot; :
&quot; our new album will be better than &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; . it will be as much an improvement over &quot; S@@ ounds &quot; as that was over &quot; Summer Days &quot; . &quot; Derek Taylor continued to write articles in the music press , sometimes anonymously , in an effort to further speculation about the album .
recording for &quot; S@@ mile &quot; lasted about a year , from mid 1966 to mid 1967 , and followed the same modular production approach as &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations . &quot; concurrently , Wilson planned many different multimedia side @-@ projects , such as a sound effects collage , a comedy album , and a &quot; health food &quot; album .
Capitol did not support some of these ideas , which led to the Beach Boys &apos; desire to form their own label , Brother Records .
according to bi@@ ographer Steven G@@ aines , Love was &quot; the most receptive &quot; to the proposal , wanting the Beach Boys to have more creative control over their work , and supported Wilson &apos;s decision to employ his newfound &quot; best friend &quot; David Ander@@ le as the head of the label , even though it was against the wishes of band manager Nick Gr@@ illo .
in a press release , Ander@@ le stated that Brother Records was to give &quot; entirely new concepts to the recording industry , and to give the Beach Boys total creative and promotional control over their product . &quot; the group established a short @-@ lived film production company , called &quot; Home Movi@@ es , &quot; to create live action film and television properties starring the Beach Boys .
the company completed only one production , a music video for &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations . &quot; released on October 10 , 1966 , &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations &quot; was the Beach Boys &apos; third US number @-@ one single , reaching the top of the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; Hot 100 in December , and became their first number one in Britain .
that month , the record was their first single certified gold by the R@@ IAA .
it came to be widely acclaimed as one of the greatest masterpieces of rock music .
in December 1966 , the Beach Boys were voted the number @-@ one band in the world in an annual readers &apos; poll conducted by &quot; N@@ ME &quot; , ahead of the Beatles , the Walker Brothers , the Rolling St@@ ones , and the Four T@@ ops . &quot;
</p>
<p>
I &apos;m sure &#91; Brian &apos;s band@@ mates &#93; saw me as somebody who was taking Brian away from them .
and somebody who was fueling Brian &apos;s weir@@ dness .
and I stand guilty on those counts ...
I was an inter@@ lop@@ er and I was definitely fueling his creativity .
by December 1966 , Wilson had completed much of the &quot; S@@ mile &quot; backing tracks .
when the Beach Boys returned from a month @-@ long tour of Europe , they were confused by the new music he had recorded and the new co@@ ter@@ ie of inter@@ lop@@ ers that surrounded him .
G@@ aines wrote that David Ander@@ le now appeared to them as the leader of &quot; a whole group of strangers &#91; that &#93; had infiltrated and taken over the Beach Boys . &quot; throughout the first half of 1967 , the album &apos;s release date was repeatedly postponed as Brian tin@@ kered with the recordings , experimenting with different takes and mixes , unable or unwilling to supply a completed version of the album .
meanwhile , he suffered from delu@@ sions and paranoia , believing on one occasion that the album track &quot; &quot; caused a building to burn down .
on January 3 , 1967 , Carl Wilson refused to be drafted for military service , leading to indictment and criminal prosecution which he challenged as a conscientious objector .
he was arrested by the FBI in April , and it would take several years in the courts before the matter would be resolved .
after months of recording and media hype , the original &quot; S@@ mile &quot; project was shelved due to the numerous personal , technical , and legal issues which surrounded its making .
a February 1967 lawsuit seeking $ 25@@ 5,000 was launched against Capitol Records over neglected royalty payments .
within the lawsuit , there was also an attempt to terminate the band &apos;s contract with Capitol before its November 1969 expiry .
since the group &apos;s future at Capitol was in limbo , an immediate release of &quot; S@@ mile &quot; would have been unlikely , regardless of whether the album was completed .
band quarrels led Parks to leave the project in April 1967 , with Ander@@ le following suit weeks later .
many of the album &apos;s advocates believe that had it been released , it would have altered the group &apos;s direction and established them at the vanguard of rock innovators .
in October 1967 , &quot; Che@@ e@@ tah &quot; magazine published &quot; Good@@ bye Sur@@ fing , Hello God ! , &quot; a memoir by Jules Si@@ egel that chron@@ ic@@ led his time with Brian during the &quot; S@@ mile &quot; sessions .
the article propelled the mythology of &quot; S@@ mile &quot; and the Beach Boys and credited the album &apos;s collapse to &quot; an obsessive cycle of creation and destruction that threatened not only his career and his fortune but also his marriage , his friendships , his relationships with the Beach Boys and , some of his closest friends worried , his mind . &quot; Carl blamed the article and &quot; a lot of that stuff that went around before &quot; with &quot; really turn &#91; ing Brian &#93; off . &quot; some of the original &quot; S@@ mile &quot; tracks continued to trickle out in later releases , often as filler tracks to offset Brian &apos;s unwillingness to contribute .
in 2011 , &quot; Un@@ cut &quot; magazine staff voted &quot; S@@ mile &quot; to be the &quot; greatest boot@@ leg recording of all time . &quot;
</p>
<p>
in May 1967 , the Beach Boys attempted to tour Europe with four extra musicians brought from the US , but were stopped by the British musicians &apos; union .
the tour went on without the extra support , and critics described their performances as &quot; am@@ ate@@ ur@@ ish &quot; and &quot; fl@@ oun@@ dering . &quot; days after announcing that &quot; S@@ mile &quot; was &quot; scrapped , &quot; Derek Taylor terminated his employment with the group to focus his attention on organizing the Monterey Pop Festival , an event held in June that the Beach Boys declined to headline at the last minute .
on December 14 , 1967 , &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; co @-@ founder and editor Jan@@ n W@@ enn@@ er printed an influential article that denounced the Beach Boys as &quot; just one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles . it &apos;s a pointless pursuit . &quot; many rock fans thus began excluding the group from &quot; serious consideration . &quot;
</p>
<p>
the Beach Boys were still under pressure and a contractual obligation to record and present an album to Capitol .
Carl remembered : &quot; Brian just said , &apos; I can &apos;t do this . we &apos;re going to make a homes@@ pun version of &#91; &quot; S@@ mile &quot; &#93; instead . we &apos;re just going to take it easy . I &apos;ll get in the pool and sing . or let &apos;s go in the gym and do our parts . &apos; that was &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; . &quot; sessions for the new album lasted from June to July 1967 at Brian &apos;s new makeshift home studio .
most of the album featured the Beach Boys playing their own instruments , rather than the session musicians employed in much of their previous work .
it was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group , instead of Brian alone .
when asked if Brian was &quot; still the producer of &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; , &quot; Carl answered , &quot; Most definitely . &quot; in July , lead single &quot; Her@@ oes and Vill@@ ains &quot; was issued , arriving after months of public anticipation , and reached number 12 in US .
it was met with general confusion among under@@ whel@@ ming reviews , and in the &quot; N@@ ME &quot; , Jim@@ i Hend@@ ri@@ x famously dismissed the single as a &quot; psych@@ ed@@ elic bar@@ ber@@ shop quartet . &quot; by then , the group &apos;s lawsuit with Capitol was resolved , and it was agreed that &quot; S@@ mile &quot; would not be the band &apos;s next album .
in August , the group embarked on a two @-@ date tour of Hawaii .
Bruce Johnston , who was absent for most of the &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; recording , did not accompany the group , although Brian did .
their performances were filmed and recorded with the intention of releasing a live album , &quot; Lei &apos;d in Hawaii &quot; , which was also left unfinished and un@@ released .
Jesse Jar@@ now of &quot; P@@ itch@@ fork &quot; opined that the Hawaii performances &quot; most definitely would not have passed the Monterey against the likes of the Who and Jim@@ i Hend@@ ri@@ x . &quot; in an interview that month , Brian stated :
&quot; I think rock n &apos; roll @-@ the pop scene @-@ is happening . it &apos;s great . but I think basically , the Beach Boys are squares . we &apos;re not happening . &quot; &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; was released on September 18 , 1967 , and peaked at number 41 in the US , making it their worst @-@ selling album to that date .
it began a string of under @-@ performing Beach Boys albums that would last until 1974 .
when released in the UK in November , it performed better , reaching number 9 .
critics and fans were generally under@@ whel@@ med by the album .
according to Scott Sch@@ inder , the album was released to &quot; general in@@ comprehension . while &quot; S@@ mile &quot; may have divided the Beach Boys &apos; fans had it been released , &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; merely baffled them . &quot; over the years , the album gathered a reputation as one of the best &quot; chill @-@ out &quot; albums to listen to during an L@@ SD com@@ ed@@ own .
in 1974 , the writing staff of &quot; N@@ ME &quot; voted it as the 64th greatest album of all time .
when we did &quot; Wild Honey &quot; , Brian asked me to get more involved in the recording end .
he wanted a break .
he had been doing it all too long .
the Beach Boys immediately recorded a new album , &quot; Wild Honey &quot; , which was an excursion into soul music .
Carl described it as &quot; music for Brian to cool out by . he was still very spaced . &quot; the album was a self @-@ conscious attempt by the Beach Boys to &quot; reg@@ roup &quot; themselves as a rock band in opposition to their more orchestr@@ al affairs of the past .
its music differs in many ways from previous Beach Boys records : it contains very little group singing compared to previous albums , and mainly features Brian singing at his piano .
again , the Beach Boys recorded mostly at his home studio .
love reflected that &quot; Wild Honey &quot; was &quot; completely out of the mainstream for what was going on at that time , which was all hard rock / psych@@ ed@@ elic music . it just didn &apos;t have anything to do with what was going on , and that was the idea . &quot; &quot; wild Honey &quot; was released on December 18 , 1967 , in competition with the Beatles &apos; &quot; Mag@@ ical My@@ stery Tour &quot; and the Rolling St@@ ones &apos; &quot; Their Sat@@ anic Maj@@ es@@ ties Request &quot; .
it had a lower chart placing than &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; and remained on the charts for only 15 weeks .
as with &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; , contemporary critics viewed it as in@@ consequential , and it alienated fans whose expectations had been raised by &quot; S@@ mile &quot; .
that month , Mike Love told a British journalist : &quot; sure people were baffled and mysti@@ fied by &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; but it was a matter of progression . we had this feeling that we were going too far , losing touch I guess , and this new one brings us back more into reality ... Brian has been re @-@ thinking our recording program and in any case we all have a much greater say nowadays in what we turn out in the studio . &quot; &quot; wild Honey &quot; remained the last Beach Boys album to feature Brian as a primary composer until 1977 .
over the coming months , its non @-@ conforming approach would be echoed in albums released by Bob D@@ ylan , the K@@ inks , and the By@@ r@@ ds .
</p>
<p>
the Beach Boys were at their lowest popularity in the late 1960s , and their cultural standing was especially worsened by their public image , which remained incongru@@ ous with the &quot; heavier &quot; music of their peers .
from 1968 onward , Brian &apos;s song@@ writing output declined substantially , but the public narrative of &quot; Brian @-@ as @-@ leader &quot; continued .
after meeting Mahar@@ ishi Mah@@ esh Yo@@ gi at a UNICEF Vari@@ ety Gala in Paris , Love , along with other high @-@ profile celebrities such as the Beatles and Don@@ ovan traveled to Ris@@ hi@@ k@@ esh in India during February and March 1968 .
the following Beach Boys album &quot; Friends &quot; had songs influenced by the Trans@@ cend@@ ental Med@@ itation taught by the Mahar@@ ishi .
in support of the &quot; Friends &quot; album , Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Mahar@@ ishi in the U.S ..
starting on May 3 , 1968 , the tour lasted five shows and was canceled when the Mahar@@ ishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts .
because of disappointing audience numbers and the Mahar@@ ishi &apos;s withdrawal , twenty @-@ four tour dates were subsequently canceled at a cost estimated at $ 250,000 for the band . &quot;
friends &quot; , released on June 24 , peaked at number 126 in the US .
a collection of Beach Boys backing tracks , &quot; St@@ ack @-@ o @-@ T@@ racks &quot; , was issued by Capitol in August .
the album became the first Beach Boys LP that failed to chart in the US and UK .
in June 1968 , Dennis be@@ fri@@ ended Charles Mans@@ on , an aspiring singer @-@ song@@ writer , and their relationship lasted for several months .
Dennis bought him time at Brian &apos;s home studio where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room .
Dennis then proposed that Mans@@ on be signed to Brother Records .
Brian reportedly disliked Mans@@ on , and so a deal was never made .
in July 1968 , the group released a standalone single , &quot; Do It Again , &quot; which was written in the style of their earlier songs .
around this time , Brian admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital .
his band@@ mates wrote and produced material in his absence .
to complete their contract with Capitol , they produced one more album , &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; , released in January 1969 .
it consisted mostly of out@@ takes and leftovers from recent albums ; Brian produced virtually none of the record .
in 1976 , Dennis called it &quot; the only let@@ down of the Beach Boys &apos; career that embarrassed me through and through ... we had to find things that Brian worked on and try and piece it together . that &apos;s when &#91; he had &#93; no involvement at all . &quot; the Beach Boys recorded one song pen@@ ned by Mans@@ on without his involvement :
&quot; cease to Ex@@ ist , &quot; rewritten as &quot; Never Learn Not to Love , &quot; which was included on &quot; 20 / 20 &quot; , but first released as the B @-@ side of a single one month earlier .
Mans@@ on was en@@ th@@ used by the idea of the group recording one of his songs ; however , after accruing a large monetary debt to the group , Dennis deliberately omitted Mans@@ on &apos;s credit on its release while also altering the song &apos;s arrangement and lyrics , which angered Mans@@ on .
as his cult of followers took over Dennis &apos; home , Dennis gradually distan@@ ced himself from Mans@@ on .
in November 1969 , three months after the Tate @-@ La@@ Bi@@ anca murders , Mans@@ on was apprehended by the police , and his connections with the Beach Boys was the subject of media attention .
he was later convicted for several counts of murder and conspiracy to murder .
Dennis refused to testify against him .

in April 1969 , the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over $ 2 million for unpaid royalties and production duties .
in May , Brian told the music press that the group &apos;s funds were depleted to the point that they were considering filing for bankruptcy at the end of the year , which &quot; Dis@@ c &amp; Music E@@ cho &quot; called &quot; stunning news &quot; and a &quot; tremendous shock on the American pop scene . &quot; Brian hoped that the success of a forthcoming single , &quot; Break Away , &quot; would mend their financial issues .
the song , which was written and produced by Brian and Mur@@ ry , reached number 63 in the US and number 16 in the UK , and Brian &apos;s remarks to the press ultimately thwarted long @-@ simmering contract negotiations with Deutsche Gram@@ m@@ oph@@ on .
the group &apos;s Capitol contract expired two weeks later with one more album still due , after which the label deleted the Beach Boys &apos; catalog from print , effectively cutting off their royalty flow .
the lawsuit was later settled in their favor and they acquired the rights to their post @-@ 1965 catalog .
in August , Sea of Tunes , the Beach Boys &apos; catalog , was sold to Ir@@ ving Al@@ mo Music for $ 700,000 .
Brian , according to his wife Marilyn Wilson , was devastated by the sale .
over the years , the catalog would generate more than $ 100 million in publishing royalties , none of which Mur@@ ry nor the band members ever received .
</p>
<p>
the group were signed to Rep@@ rise Records in 1970 .
Scott Sch@@ inder described the label as &quot; probably the hip@@ pest and most artist @-@ friendly major label of the time . &quot; the deal was brokered by Van Dy@@ ke Parks , who was then employed as a multimedia executive at Warner Music Group .
re@@ prise &apos;s contract stipulated Brian &apos;s proactive involvement with the band in all albums By the time the Beach Boys tenure ended with Capitol in 1969 , they had sold 65 million records worldwide , closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music .
after recording over 30 different songs and going through several album titles , their first LP for Rep@@ rise , &quot; Sun@@ flower &quot; , was released on August 31 , 1970 . &quot;
sunflower &quot; featured a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members .
Brian was active during this period , writing or co @-@ writing seven of the twelve songs on &quot; Sun@@ flower &quot; and performing at half of the band &apos;s domestic concerts in 1970 .
the album received critical acclaim in both the US and the UK .
this was offset by the album reaching only number 151 on US record charts during a four @-@ week stay , becoming the worst selling Beach Boys album at that point .
in his review for &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; , critic Jim Miller praised the album as &quot; without doubt the best Beach Boys album in recent memory , a styl@@ istically coherent &quot; tour de force &quot; , &quot; but m@@ used :
&quot; it makes one wonder though whether anyone still listens to their music , or could give a shit about it . &quot; in the UK , the album reached 29 .
fans generally regard the LP as the Beach Boys &apos; finest post@@ - &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; album .
in 2003 , it placed at number 380 on &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; s &quot; Great@@ est Alb@@ ums of All Time &quot; list .
sometime in 1969 , Brian opened a short @-@ lived health food store called the Radi@@ ant Rad@@ ish , While working there , he met journalist and radio presenter Jack Ri@@ el@@ ey .
Ri@@ el@@ ey spoke with Brian for a radio interview , with the subject eventually turning to the un@@ released song &quot; Sur@@ f &apos;s Up , &quot; a track which had taken on notori@@ ety since the demise of the &quot; S@@ mile &quot; album three years earlier .
Brian did not feel it should be released .
on August 8 , 1970 , Ri@@ el@@ ey offered a six @-@ page memo r@@ umin@@ ating on how to stimulate &quot; increased record sales and popularity for The Beach Boys . &quot; in the fall of 1970 , the Beach Boys hired Ri@@ el@@ ey as their manager .
one of his initiatives was to encourage the band to record songs featuring more socially conscious lyrics .
he also requested the completion of &quot; Sur@@ f &apos;s Up &quot; and arranged a guest appearance at a Gr@@ at@@ eful Dead concert at Bill Graham &apos;s F@@ ill@@ more East in April 1971 to foreground the Beach Boys &apos; transition into the counter@@ culture .
during this time , the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage .
on August 30 , 1971 , the band released &quot; Sur@@ f &apos;s Up &quot; , which included the title track .
the album was moderately successful , reaching the US top 30 , a marked improvement over their recent releases .
while the record charted , the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near @-@ sel@@ l@@ out set at Carnegie Hall ; their live shows during this era included re@@ worked arrangements of many of the band &apos;s previous songs .
a large portion of their set lists cul@@ led from &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; and &quot; S@@ mile &quot; .
music writer D@@ omen@@ ic Pri@@ ore noted , &quot; They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967 . &quot; Dennis injured his hand during the &quot; Sur@@ f &apos;s Up &quot; sessions , leaving him temporarily unable to play the drums .
</p>

re@@ prise , however , felt that the album required a strong single .
this resulted in the song &quot; Sa@@ il On , S@@ ail@@ or , &quot; a collaboration between Brian Wilson , T@@ and@@ yn Al@@ mer , Ray Kennedy , Jack Ri@@ el@@ ey and Van Dy@@ ke Parks featuring a soul@@ ful lead vocal by Chaplin .
re@@ prise subsequently approved , and the resulting album , &quot; Holland &quot; , was released in January 1973 , peaking at number 37 .
Brian &apos;s musical children story , &quot; Mount Vernon and Fair@@ way &quot; was included as a bonus EP .
in August 1973 , the 41 @-@ song sound@@ track to &quot; American Gra@@ ffiti &quot; was released , including the band &apos;s early songs &quot; Sur@@ fin &apos; Saf@@ ari &quot; and &quot; All Summer Long . &quot; the album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness .
Chaplin also left in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love , the band &apos;s business manager .
in June 1974 , Capitol issued &quot; En@@ dless Summer &quot; , the band &apos;s first major pre- &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; greatest hits package .
the compilation rose to the top of the &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; album charts .
it remained on the charts for two years , the longest of any Beach Boys release .
Capitol followed with a second compilation , &quot; Spirit of America &quot; , which also sold well .
with these compilations , the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock , propelling themselves from opening for Cro@@ sby , S@@ til@@ ls , Nash and Young to head@@ liners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks . &quot;
rolling Stone &quot; named the Beach Boys the &quot; Band of the Year &quot; for 1974 .
Fat@@ aar remained with the band until 1974 , when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future Eag@@ les member Joe Walsh .
Chaplin &apos;s replacement , James William Gu@@ er@@ cio , started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager .
under Gu@@ er@@ cio , the Beach Boys staged a successful 1975 joint concert tour with Chicago , with each group performing some of the other &apos;s songs , including their previous year &apos;s collaboration on Chicago &apos;s single &quot; W@@ ishing You Were Here . &quot; while their concerts continuously sold out , the stage act slowly changed from a contemporary presentation followed by ol@@ dies enc@@ ores to an entire show made up of mostly pre @-@ 1967 music .

Brian wanted to be left alone , but there was too much at stake .
if you &apos;ve got an oil well , you don &apos;t want it to wander off and become someone else &apos;s oil well .
Brian spent the majority of two years secluded in the chauff@@ eur &apos;s quarters of his home , abusing alcohol , taking drugs , over@@ eating , and exhibiting other self @-@ destructive behavior .
although increasingly re@@ clusive during the day , Wilson spent many nights at singer Danny Hut@@ ton &apos;s house , frater@@ n@@ izing with colleagues such as Alice Cooper and Ig@@ gy Pop .
in 1975 , Brian attempted to join California Music , a Los Angeles collective that included Gary U@@ sher , Cur@@ t Bo@@ et@@ t@@ cher , and Bruce Johnston .
the Beach Boys &apos; recent &quot; En@@ dless Summer &quot; compilation was selling well , and the band was touring non @-@ stop , making them the biggest live draw in the US .
Gu@@ er@@ cio was then fired by the group and replaced by Steve Love , who urged the group to encourage Brian to return to the production helm .
according to Steve : &quot; we were under contract with Warner Bro@@ s. , and we couldn &apos;t have him going on a tangent . if he was going to be productive , it &apos;s gotta be for the Beach Boys . &quot; Brian , who had already grown tired of working with the Beach Boys , was then legally ousted from California Music in order to focus his undivided attention on the band .
in October , Marilyn persuaded Brian to admit himself under the care of psycho@@ therapist Eugene Lan@@ dy , who was successful in keeping Brian from indulging in substance abuse with constant supervision .
at the end of January 1976 , the Beach Boys returned to the studio with an apprehensive Brian producing once again .
at the time , he felt : &quot; it was a little scary because &#91; the Beach Boys and I &#93; weren &apos;t as close . we had drifted apart , personality @-@ wise . a lot of the guys had developed new personalities through meditation . ... But we went into the studio with the attitude that we had to get it done . &quot; group meetings were supervised by Lan@@ dy , and discussions over each song for the record were reported to last for up to eight hours .
Brian decided the band should do an album of rock and roll and doo w@@ op standards .
Carl and Dennis disagreed , feeling that an album of originals was far more ideal , while Love and J@@ ard@@ ine wanted the album out as quickly as possible .
Brian &apos;s production role was undermined as group members over@@ dubbed and re@@ mixed tracks , without his knowledge , to fight against his desire for a rough , unfinished sound .
he later attributed his hoarse voice on the album to a bout of laryn@@ gi@@ tis .
released on July 5 , 1976 , &quot; 15 Big Ones &quot; was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release .
its lead single , a cover of Chuck Berry &apos;s &quot; Rock and Roll Music , &quot; peaked at number five .
Carl and Dennis dis@@ parag@@ ed the album to the press .
in December , Brian was released from Lan@@ dy &apos;s program due to disputes over the doctor &apos;s monthly fee .
from late 1976 to early 1977 , Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band &apos;s next album &quot; The Beach Boys Love You &quot; , a collection of 14 songs mostly written , arranged and produced alone .
it was divided between fans and critics .
some saw the album as a work of &quot; eccentric genius &quot; whereas others dismissed it as &quot; childish and trivial . &quot; in a review for &quot; Cir@@ cus &quot; , Lester Ban@@ gs called the Beach Boys &quot; a diseased bunch of mother@@ fu@@ c@@ kers if ever there was one ... But the miracle is that the Beach Boys have made that disease sound like the literal baby@@ flesh pink of health . &quot; the album was released weeks after the band signed a new record deal with CBS .
G@@ aines hypothe@@ sized that the lack of promotion Rep@@ rise put into &quot; Love You &quot; was a byproduct of the falling out between artist and label .
</p>
<p>
after &quot; Love You &quot; was released , Brian assembled &quot; Adult / Child &quot; , an un@@ released effort largely consisting of songs written by Brian from 1976 and 1977 with select big band arrangements by Dick Reynolds .
although publicized as the Beach Boys &apos; next release , &quot; Adult / Child &quot; caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved .
following this period , his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic .
the internal wran@@ gling came to a head after a show at Central Park on September 1 , 1977 , when the band effectively split into two camps ;
Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side , Mike Love and Al J@@ ard@@ ine on the other with Brian remaining neutral .
following a confrontation on an airport tar@@ mac , Dennis declared to &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; on September 3 that he had left the band :
that was a division . ... myself and Al J@@ ard@@ ine and Bruce Johnston were not &#91; part of that lifestyle &#93; .
the band broke up for two and a half weeks , until a meeting on September 17 at Brian &apos;s house .
in light of a potential new Carib@@ ou Records contract the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian &apos;s vote in the group , allowing Love and J@@ ard@@ ine to out@@ vote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter .
Dennis started to withdraw from the group to focus on his second solo album , &quot; Bam@@ bu &quot; .
the album was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers .
Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle .
their last album for Rep@@ rise , &quot; M.@@ I.@@ U. Album &quot; , was recorded at Mahar@@ ishi International University in Iowa at the suggestion of Love .
Dennis and Carl made limited contributions ; the album was mostly produced by J@@ ard@@ ine and Ron Al@@ t@@ bach , with Brian credited as &quot; executive producer . &quot; &quot; M.@@ I.@@ U. &quot; was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Rep@@ rise , who likewise did not promote the result .
</p>
<p>
in an April 1980 interview , Carl reflected that &quot; the last two years have been the most important and difficult time of our career . we were at the ultimate crossroads . we had to decide whether what we had been involved in since we were teenagers had lost its meaning . we asked ourselves and each other the difficult questions we &apos;d often avoided in the past . &quot; by the next year , he left the touring group because of unhappiness with the band &apos;s nostalgia format and lack@@ luster live performances , subsequently pursuing a solo career .
he stated : &quot; I haven &apos;t quit the Beach Boys but I do not plan on touring with them until they decide that 1981 means as much to them as 1961 . &quot; Carl returned on May 1982 , after approximately 14 months of being away , on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies and refrain from &quot; Las Vegas @-@ type &quot; engagements .
later that year , Brian over@@ do@@ sed on a combination of alcohol , cocaine , and other psychoactive drugs .
his former therapist Eugene Lan@@ dy was once more employed , and a more radical program was undertaken to try to restore Brian to health .
this involved removing him from the group on November 5 , 1982 , at the behest of Carl , Love , and J@@ ard@@ ine , in addition to putting him on a rigorous diet and health regimen .
coupled with long , extreme counseling sessions , this therapy was successful in bringing Brian back to physical health , slim@@ ming down from to .
from 1980 through 1982 , the Beach Boys and the Grass Roo@@ ts performed Independence Day concerts at the National Mall in Washington , D.C. , attracting large crowds .
however , in April 1983 , James G. Watt , President Ronald Reagan &apos;s Secretary of the Interior , banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups .
Watt said that &quot; rock bands &quot; that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted &quot; the wrong element , &quot; who would steal from attendees .
during the ensuing uproar , which included over 40,000 complaints to the Department of the Interior , the Beach Boys stated that the Soviet Union , which had invited them to perform in Len@@ ingrad in 1978 , ... &quot; obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element . &quot; Vice President George H. W. Bush said of the Beach Boys , &quot; They &apos;re my friends and I like their music . &quot; Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan were fans .
White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it , showing that he had &quot; shot himself in the foot . &quot; in 1983 , tensions between Dennis and Love escalated so high that each obtained a restraining order against the other .
with the rest of the band fearing that he would end up like Brian , Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into re@@ hab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them .
Dennis checked into re@@ hab for his chance to get sober , but on December 28 , 1983 , he fatally drowned at the age of 39 in Marina del Re@@ y while diving from a friend &apos;s boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage .
between 1983 and 1986 , Lan@@ dy charged Brian about $ 4@@ 30,000 annually .
when he requested more money , Carl was obliged to give away a quarter of Brian &apos;s publishing royalties .
as Brian &apos;s recovery consolidated , he stopped working with the Beach Boys on a regular basis .
in 1988 , they unexpectedly claimed their first U.S. number one single in 22 years with &quot; Kok@@ omo , &quot; which topped the chart for one week .
it appeared in the movie &quot; Cock@@ tail &quot; They released the album &quot; Still Cru@@ is@@ in &quot; &apos; , which went platinum in the US .
</p>
<p>
love filed a defamation lawsuit against Brian due to how he was presented in Brian &apos;s 1992 memoir &quot; &quot; .
its publisher Har@@ per@@ Collins settled the suit for $ 1.5 million .
he said that the suit allowed his lawyer &quot; to gain access to the transcripts of Brian &apos;s interviews with his &#91; book &#93; collabor@@ ator , Todd Gold . those interviews affirmed - according to Brian - that I had been the inspiration of the group and that I had written many of the songs that &#91; would soon be &#93; in dispute . &quot; other defamation lawsuits were filed by Carl , Brother Records , and the Wil@@ sons &apos; mother Aud@@ ree .
with Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed , Love sued Brian in 1992 , winning $ 13 million in 1994 for lost royalties .
35 of the group &apos;s songs were then amended to credit Love .
he later called it &quot; almost certainly the largest case of fraud in music history . &quot; the day after California courts issued a restraining order between Brian and Lan@@ dy , Brian phoned S@@ ire Records staff producer Andy Pal@@ ey to collaborate on new material tentatively for the Beach Boys .
after losing the song@@ writing credits lawsuit with Love , Brian told &quot; MO@@ JO &quot; in February 1995 :
&quot; Mike and I are just cool . there &apos;s a lot of shit Andy and I got written for him . I just had to get through that goddamn trial ! &quot; in April , it was unclear whether the project would turn into a Wilson solo album , a Beach Boys album , or a combination of the two .
the project ultimately disintegrated .
instead , Brian and his band@@ mates recorded &quot; Stars and Stri@@ pes Vol . 1 &quot; , an album of country music stars covering Beach Boys songs , with co @-@ production hel@@ med by River North Records owner Joe Thomas .
afterward , the group discussed finishing the album &quot; S@@ mile &quot; , but Carl rejected the idea , fearing that it would cause Brian another nervous breakdown .
in early 1997 , Carl was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking .
despite his terminal condition , Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy .
during performances , he sat on a stool and needed oxygen after every song .
Carl died on February 6 , 1998 at the age of 51 , two months after the death of the Wil@@ sons &apos; mother , Aud@@ ree .

in turn , J@@ ard@@ ine left the band and began to tour regularly with his band &quot; Beach Boys : family &amp; Friends &quot; until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license .
meanwhile , J@@ ard@@ ine sued Love , claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts .
marks left the touring band in 1999 because of his health .
in 2000 , ABC @-@ TV premi@@ ered a two @-@ part television minis@@ eries , &quot; &quot; , that dram@@ atized the Beach Boys &apos; story .
it was produced by John Stam@@ os , and was criticized for historical inaccuracies .
Wilson said that he &quot; didn &apos;t like the second part . it wasn &apos;t really true to the way things were . I &apos;d like to see another movie if it was done right . &quot; in 2004 , Wilson recorded and released his solo album &quot; Brian Wilson Pres@@ ents S@@ mile &quot; , a re@@ interpretation of the unfinished &quot; S@@ mile &quot; project .
that September , Wilson issued a free CD through the &quot; Mail On Sunday &quot; that included Beach Boys songs he had recently r@@ erec@@ or@@ ded , five of which he co @-@ authored with Love .
the 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005 ; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings .
love &apos;s suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no tri@@ able issues .

on December 16 , 2011 , it was announced that Wilson , Love , J@@ ard@@ ine , Johnston and David Marks would reunite for a new album and 50th anniversary tour .
on February 12 , 2012 , the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Gram@@ my Awards , in what was billed as a &quot; special performance &quot; by organizers .
it marked the group &apos;s first live performance to include Wilson since 1996 , J@@ ard@@ ine since 1998 , and Marks since 1999 .
released on June 5 , &quot; That &apos;s Why God Made the Radio &quot; debu@@ ted at number 3 on U.S. charts , which expanding the group &apos;s span of &quot; Bill@@ board &quot; 200 top ten albums across 49 years and one week , passing the Beatles with 47 years of top ten albums .
critics generally regarded the album as an &quot; uneven &quot; collection , with most of the praise centered on its closing musical suite .
on June 1 , 2012 , Love received an e @-@ mail from Brian &apos;s wife and manager Melinda Led@@ better stating &quot; no more shows for Wilson . &quot; love , who is obligated by his license of the Beach Boys name to maintain revenue flow to Brother Records , then began accepting invitations for when the reunion was over .
on June 25 , Led@@ better sent another e @-@ mail asking to disregard her last message , but by then , Love says , &quot; it was too late . we had booked other concerts , and promoters had begun selling tickets . &quot; the next day , Love announced additional touring dates that would not feature Wilson .
Wilson then denied knowledge of these new dates .
he later wrote : &quot; I had wanted to send out a joint press release , between Brian and me , formally announcing the end of the reunion tour on September 28 . but I couldn &apos;t get Brian &apos;s management team on board . &quot; in late September , news outlets began reporting that Love had dismissed Wilson from the Beach Boys .
on October 5 , Love responded in a self @-@ written press release to the &quot; LA Times &quot; stating he &quot; did not fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys . I cannot fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys ... I do not have such authority . and even if I did , I would never fire Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys . &quot; he explained that nobody in the band &quot; wanted to do a 50th anniversary tour that lasted 10 years &quot; and that its limited run &quot; was long agreed upon . &quot; four days later , Wilson and J@@ ard@@ ine submitted a written response to the rumors stating :
&quot; I was completely blind@@ sided by his press release ... We hadn &apos;t even discussed as a band what we were going to do with all the offers that were coming in for more 50th shows . &quot; love said that Wilson &apos;s statements in this press release were falsified by his agents .
love and Johnston continued to perform under the Beach Boys brand name , while Wilson , J@@ ard@@ ine , and Marks continued to tour as a trio , Reflec@@ ting upon the band &apos;s reunion in 2013 , Love stated :
&quot; I had a wonderful experience being in the studio together . Brian has lost none of his ability to structure those melodies and chord progres@@ sions ... T@@ ouring was more for the fans . ... It was a great experience , it had a term to it , and now everyone &apos;s going on with their ways of doing things . &quot; J@@ ard@@ ine , Marks , Johnston and Love appeared together at the 2014 El@@ la Awards Ceremony , where Love was honored for his work as a singer .
in 2015 , &quot; S@@ ound@@ stage &quot; aired an episode featuring Wilson performing with J@@ ard@@ ine and former Beach Boys B@@ lon@@ die Chaplin and R@@ icky Fat@@ aar at The Venetian in Las Vegas .
in April 2015 , when asked if he was interested in making music with Love again , Wilson replied :
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , no , &quot; later adding in July that he &quot; doesn &apos;t talk to the Beach Boys &#91; or &#93; Mike Love . &quot; in 2016 , Love and Wilson published memoirs , &quot; &quot; and &quot; I Am Brian Wilson &quot; , respectively .
love was asked about negative comments that Wilson made about him in the book and said :
&quot; he &apos;s not in charge of his life , like I am mine . his every move is orchestrated and a lot of things he &apos;s purported to say , there &apos;s not tape of it . but , I don &apos;t like to put undue pressure on him , either , because I know he has a lot of issues . out of compassion , I don &apos;t respond to everything that is purportedly said by him . &quot; in an interview with &quot; Rolling Stone &quot; conducted in June 2016 , Wilson stated that he would like to try to repair his relationship with Love and collaborate with him again .
in January 2017 , Love stated &quot; If it were possible to make it just Brian and I , and have it under control and done better than what happened in 2012 , then yeah , I &apos;d be open to something . &quot; in July 2018 , Wilson , J@@ ard@@ ine , Love , Johnston , and Marks reunited for a one @-@ off Q &amp; A session moderated by director Rob Re@@ iner at the Capitol Records Tower in Los Angeles .
it was the first time the band appeared together in public since their 2012 tour .
in December 2018 , Love described his new holiday album , &quot; Reason for the Season , &quot; as a &quot; message to Brian &quot; and admitted that he &quot; would love nothing more than to get together with Brian and do some music . &quot;

in &quot; Understanding Rock : essays in Mus@@ ical Analysis &quot; , mus@@ ic@@ ologist Daniel Harrison summarizes :
even from their inception , the Beach Boys were an experimental group .
they combined , as Jim Miller has put it , &quot; the instrumental sle@@ ek@@ ness of the Ven@@ tures , the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry , and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between the Let@@ ter@@ men and Frank@@ ie L@@ ym@@ on and the Te@@ en@@ agers &quot; with lyrics whose images , idioms , and concerns were drawn from the ra@@ re@@ fied world of the middle @-@ class white male southern California teenager . ...
&#91; but &#93; it was the profound vocal virtu@@ osity of the group , coupled with the ob@@ sessional drive and com@@ positional ambitions of their leader , Brian Wilson , that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever . ...
comparison to other voc@@ ally oriented rock groups , such as the Association , shows the Beach Boys &apos; technique to be far superior , almost embarrass@@ ingly so .
they were so confident of their ability , and of Brian &apos;s skill as a producer to enhance it , that they were un@@ afraid of doing sophisticated , a cap@@ p@@ ella gle@@ e @-@ club arrangements containing multiple suspensions , passing formations , complex chords , and both chromatic and en@@ harmonic mod@@ ulations .
the Beach Boys began as a garage band playing 1950s style rock and roll , reas@@ sem@@ bling styles of music such as surf to include vocal jazz harmony , which created their unique sound .
in addition , they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the pop bal@@ lad by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll .
among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys &apos; style were the nasal quality of their singing voices , their use of a fal@@ set@@ to harmony over a driving , locomotive @-@ like melody , and the sudden chim@@ ing in of the whole group on a key line .
Brian Wilson handled most stages of the group &apos;s recording process from the beginning , even though he was not properly credited on most of the early recordings .
early on , Mike Love sang lead voc@@ als in the rock @-@ oriented songs , while Carl contributed guitar lines on the group &apos;s ball@@ ads .
Jim Miller observed , &quot; On straight roc@@ kers they sang tight harmon@@ ies behind Love &apos;s lead ... on ball@@ ads , Brian played his fal@@ set@@ to off against lush , jazz @-@ tinged voic@@ ings , often using unorthodox harmonic structures . &quot; Harrison adds that &quot; even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys &apos; early up@@ tempo rock &apos; n &apos; roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level ;
Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone . &quot; although Brian was often dubbed a perfec@@ tionist , he was an inexperienced musician , and his understanding of music was mostly self @-@ taught .
at the lyric stage , he usually worked with Love , whose assertive persona provided youthful sw@@ ag@@ ger that contrasted Brian &apos;s explorations in roman@@ ticism and sensitivity .
Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band &apos;s circle , in the examples &quot; Lon@@ ely Sea &quot; and &quot; In My Room . &quot; Brian &apos;s band@@ mates resented the notion that he was the sole creative force in the group .
in a 1966 article that asked if &quot; the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian , &quot; Carl explained that although Brian was the most responsible for their music , every member of the group contributed ideas .
Mike Love wrote , &quot; As far as I was concerned , Brian &quot; was &quot; a genius , deserving of that recognition . but the rest of us were seen as nameless components in Brian &apos;s music machine ... It didn &apos;t feel to us as if we were just riding on Brian &apos;s co@@ at@@ tails . &quot; conversely , Dennis defended Brian &apos;s stature in the band , stating &quot; Brian Wilson &quot; is &quot; the Beach Boys . he is the band . we &apos;re his fucking messengers . he is all of it . period . we &apos;re nothing . he &apos;s everything . &quot;
</p>
<p>
the band &apos;s earliest influences came primarily from the work of Chuck Berry and the Four Fresh@@ men .
performed by the Four Fresh@@ men , &quot; Their Hear@@ ts Were Full of Spring &quot; was a particular favorite of the group .
by analyzing their arrangements of pop standards , Brian educated himself on jazz harmony .
bearing this in mind , Philip Lambert noted , &quot; If Bob F@@ lan@@ igan helped teach Brian how to sing , then Ger@@ sh@@ win , K@@ ern , Porter , and the other members of this pan@@ the@@ on helped him learn how to craft a song . &quot; other general influences on the group included the Hi @-@ Los , the Pen@@ gu@@ ins , the Rob@@ ins , Bill Hal@@ ey &amp; His Com@@ ets , O@@ tis Williams , the Cad@@ ets , the Ever@@ ly Brothers , the Shi@@ rel@@ les , the Reg@@ ents , and the Cryst@@ als .
though the Beach Boys are often car@@ ic@@ at@@ ured as the ultimate white , suburban act , black R &amp; B was crucial to their sound .
the eclec@@ tic mix of white and black vocal group influences - ranging from the rock and roll of Berry , the jazz harmon@@ ies of the Four Fresh@@ men , the pop of the Four Pre@@ ps , the folk of the Kingston Tri@@ o , the R &amp; B of groups like the Co@@ asters and the Five S@@ atin@@ s , and the doo w@@ op of Di@@ on and the Bel@@ mon@@ ts - helped contribute to the Beach Boys &apos; uniqueness in American popular music .
Carl remembered : &quot; most of &#91; Mike &apos;s &#93; classmates were black . he was the only white guy on his track team . he was really immersed in doo @-@ w@@ op and that music and I think he influenced Brian to listen to it . the black artists were so much better in terms of rock records in those days that the white records almost sounded like put @-@ ons . &quot; on Jim@@ i Hend@@ ri@@ x and &quot; heavy &quot; music , Brian said he felt no pressure to go in that direction :
&quot; we never got into the heavy musical level trip . we never needed to . it &apos;s already been done . &quot; another significant influence on Brian &apos;s work was Bur@@ t Bach@@ ar@@ ach .
he said in the 1960s : &quot; Bur@@ t Bach@@ ar@@ ach and H@@ al David are more like me . they &apos;re also the best pop team - per se - today . as a producer , Bach@@ ar@@ ach has a very fresh , new approach . &quot; regarding surf rock pioneer Dick Dale , Brian said that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing .
Carl credited Chuck Berry , the Ven@@ tures , and John Walker with shaping his guitar style , and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ven@@ tures &apos; songs by ear early in their career .
in 1967 , Lou Reed wrote in &quot; As@@ pen &quot; that the Beach Boys created a &quot; hybrid sound &quot; out of old rock and the Four Fresh@@ men , explaining that such songs as &quot; Let Him Run Wild , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t Wor@@ ry Baby , &quot; &quot; I Get Around , &quot; and &quot; Fun , Fun , Fun &quot; were not unlike &quot; Pep@@ per@@ mint S@@ tick &quot; by the El@@ chords .
similarly , John Sebastian of the Lov@@ in &apos; Spo@@ on@@ ful noted , &quot; Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea . we had never paid attention to the Four Fresh@@ men or doo @-@ w@@ op com@@ bos like the Cre@@ w Cu@@ ts . look what gold he mined out of that . &quot;
</p>
<p>
Brian identified each member individually for their vocal range , once detailing the ranges for Carl , Dennis , J@@ ard@@ ine , Love , and himself .
J@@ ard@@ ine explains , &quot; We always sang the same vocal intervals . ... As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we &apos;d figure it out pretty easily . if there was a vocal move &#91; Brian &#93; envisioned , he &apos;d show that particular singer that move . we had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that &#91; was &#93; never a problem for us . &quot; striving for perfection , Brian insured that his intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group &apos;s calculated blend of intonation , attack , phrasing , and expression .
sometimes , he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi @-@ track tape .
it &apos;s not widely known , but Michael had a hand in a lot of the arrangements .
he would bring out the fun@@ k@@ ier approaches , whether to go &quot; sh@@ oo @-@ boo @-@ b@@ op &quot; or &quot; b@@ om @-@ b@@ om @-@ did @-@ di @-@ did @-@ did &quot; .
it makes a big difference , because it can change the whole rhythm , the whole color and tone of it .
&quot; Jack Good once told us , &apos; You sing like eun@@ uch@@ s in a Sis@@ tine Chap@@ el , &apos; which was a pretty good quote . &quot; writer Richard Gold@@ stein reported that , according to a fellow journalist who asked Brian about the black roots of his music , Brian &apos;s response was :
&quot; we &apos;re white and we sing white . &quot; Gold@@ stein added that when he asked where his approach to vocal harmon@@ ies had derived from , Wilson answered : &apos; bar@@ ber@@ shop &apos; . &quot;
</p>
<p>
nine months after forming , the group acquired national success , and demand for their personal appearance skyroc@@ keted .
bi@@ ographer James Murphy said , &quot; By most contemporary accounts , they were not a very good live band when they started . ... The Beach Boys learned to play as a band in front of live audiences , &quot; eventually to become &quot; one of the best and enduring live bands . &quot; for the recording of the Beach Boys &apos; instrumental tracks , Brian arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of session musicians later known as &quot; the W@@ rec@@ king Cre@@ w . &quot; their assistance was needed because of the increasingly complicated nature of the material .
afterward , the members only performed the instrumental tracks to certain recordings .
it is the belief of Ric@@ hie Un@@ ter@@ berger that , &quot; Before session musicians took over most of the parts , the Beach Boys could play respec@@ tably gut@@ sy surf rock as a self @-@ contained unit . &quot; Carl was an exception among the group in that he played alongside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions .
in archi@@ vist Craig S@@ low@@ inski &apos;s view , &quot; One should not sell short Carl &apos;s own contributions ; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the hor@@ de of high @-@ dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio . Carl &apos;s guitar playing &#91; was &#93; a key ingredient . &quot; a common misconception is that Dennis &apos; drum@@ ming in the Beach Boys &apos; recordings was filled in exclusively by studio musicians .
his drum@@ ming is documented on a number of the group &apos;s singles , including &quot; I Get Around , &quot; &quot; Fun , Fun Fun , &quot; and &quot; Don &apos;t Wor@@ ry Baby . &quot;
</p>
<p>
the band members often reflected on the spiritual nature of their music , particularly for the recording of &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; and &quot; S@@ mile &quot; .
even though the Wil@@ sons did not grow up in a particularly religious household , Carl was described as &quot; the most truly religious person I know &quot; by Brian , and Carl was forthcoming about the group &apos;s spiritual beliefs stating :
&quot; I &apos;m very religious . not in the sense of churches , going to church ; but like the essence of &quot; all &quot; religion . &quot; during the recording of &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; , Brian held prayer meetings , later reflecting that &quot; God was with us the whole time we were doing this record ... I could feel that feeling in my brain . &quot; in 1966 , he explained that he wanted to move into a white spiritual sound , and predicted that the rest of the music industry would follow suit .
in 2011 , Brian maintained the spirituality was important to his music , and that he did not follow any particular religion .
Carl said that &quot; S@@ mile &quot; was chosen as an album title because of its connection to the group &apos;s spiritual beliefs .
Brian referred to &quot; S@@ mile &quot; as his &quot; teenage symphony to God , &quot; composing a hymn , &quot; Our Pra@@ yer , &quot; as the album &apos;s opening spiritual invocation .
experimentation with psychotropic substances also proved pivotal to the group &apos;s development as artists .
he spoke of his L@@ SD trips as a &quot; religious experience , &quot; and during a session for &quot; Our Pra@@ yer , &quot; Brian can be heard asking the other Beach Boys :
&quot; do you guys feel any acid yet ? . &quot; in 1968 , Mike Love &apos;s interest in transcendental meditation led the Beach Boys to record the original song , &quot; Trans@@ cend@@ ental Med@@ itation . &quot;
</p>
<p>
the Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed , commercially successful , and influential bands of all time .
their sales estimates range from 100 to 350 million records worldwide , and have influenced artists spanning many genres and decades .
the group &apos;s early songs made them major pop stars in the US , the UK , Australia and other countries , having seven top 10 singles between April 1963 and November 1964 .
they were one of the first American groups to exhibit the definitive traits of a self @-@ contained rock band , playing their own instruments and writing their own songs , and they were one of the few American bands formed prior to the 1964 British Inv@@ asion to continue their success .
among artists of the 1960s , they are one of few central figures in the histories of rock .
Brian Wilson &apos;s artistic control over the Beach Boys &apos; records was unprecedented for the time .
Carl Wilson elaborated : &quot; record companies were used to having absolute control over their artists . it was especially nerv@@ y , because Brian was a 21 @-@ year @-@ old kid with just two albums . it was unheard of . but what could they say ? Brian made good records . &quot; this made the Beach Boys one of the first rock groups to exert studio control .
music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on Brian &apos;s influence , setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers , either autonomously , or in conjunction with other like minds .
the band routinely appears in the upper reaches of ranked lists such as &quot; The Top 1000 Alb@@ ums of All Time . &quot; many of the group &apos;s songs and albums , including &quot; The Beach Boys Today ! &quot; , &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; , &quot; Sun@@ flower &quot; , and &quot; Sur@@ f &apos;s Up &quot; - and especially &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; and &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations &quot; - are featured in numerous lists devoted to the greatest albums or singles of all time .
the latter two frequently appear on the number one spot .
on Ac@@ claimed Music , which aggregates the rankings of decades of critics &apos; lists , &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; is ranked as the greatest album of all time , while &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations &quot; is the third @-@ greatest song of all time .
the group itself is ranked number 11 in its 1000 most recommended artists of all time .
in 1988 , the core quin@@ tet of the Wilson brothers , Love , and J@@ ard@@ ine were induc@@ ted into the Rock and Roll Hall of F@@ ame .
ten years later , they were selected for the V@@ ocal Group Hall of F@@ ame .
in 2004 , &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot; culturally , historically , and aesthe@@ tically significant . &quot; their recordings of &quot; In My Room , &quot; &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations , &quot; &quot; California Girls &quot; and the entire &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; album have been induc@@ ted into the Gram@@ my Hall of F@@ ame .
in 2017 , a study of All@@ Music &apos;s catalog indicated the Beach Boys as the 6th most frequently cited artist influence in its database .
for the 50th anniversary of &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; , 26 artists contributed to a &quot; P@@ itch@@ fork &quot; retrospective on its influence , which included comments from members of Talking Heads , Yo La Teng@@ o , Chair@@ lift , and Def@@ tones .
the editor noted that the &quot; wide swa@@ th of artists assembled for this feature represent but a mo@@ dic@@ um of the album &apos;s vast measure of influence . its scope transcends just about all lines of age , race , and gender . its impact continues to broaden with each passing generation . &quot;

<p>
professor of cultural studies James M. Curtis wrote in 1987 , &quot; We can say that the Beach Boys represent the outlook and values of white Protestant Anglo @-@ Saxon teenagers in the early six@@ ties . having said that , we immediately realize that they must mean much more than this . their stability , their staying power , and their ability to attract new fans prove as much . &quot; cultural historian Kevin Star@@ r explains that the group first connected with young Americans specifically for their ly@@ rical interpretation of a myth@@ olog@@ ized landscape :
the group &apos;s surf music was not entirely of their own invention , being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale .
however , previous surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did .
the band &apos;s earlier surf music helped raise the profile of the state of California , creating its first major regional style with national significance , and establishing a musical identity for Southern California , as opposed to Hollywood .
California ultimately suppl@@ anted New York as the center of popular music thanks to the success of Brian &apos;s productions .
between 1964 and 1969 , it fueled innovation and transition , inspiring artists to tackle largely un@@ mentioned themes such as sexual freedom , black pride , drugs , op@@ positional politics , other counter@@ cultural mo@@ tif@@ s , and war .
soft pop derived in part from this movement .
sunshine pop producers widely im@@ itated the orchestr@@ al style of &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; ; however , the Beach Boys themselves were rarely representative of the genre , which was rooted in easy @-@ listening and advertising jing@@ les .
</p>
<p>
&quot; pet S@@ ounds &quot; came to inform the developments of genres such as pop , rock , jazz , electronic , experimental , punk , and hip hop .
similar to subsequent experimental rock L@@ Ps by Frank Z@@ app@@ a , the Beatles , and the Who , &quot; P@@ et S@@ ounds &quot; featured counter@@ tex@@ tural aspects that called attention to the very recor@@ dedness of the album .
professor of American history John Robert Gre@@ ene stated that the album broke new ground and took rock music away from its casual lyrics and melo@@ dic structures into what was then uncharted territory .
he furthermore called it one factor which spawned the majority of trends in post @-@ 1965 rock music , the only others being &quot; Rubber Soul &quot; , &quot; Rev@@ ol@@ ver &quot; , and the contemporary folk movement .
the album was the first piece in popular music to incorporate the Electr@@ o @-@ Ther@@ em@@ in , an easier @-@ to @-@ play version of the ther@@ em@@ in , as well as the first in rock music to feature a ther@@ em@@ in @-@ like instrument .
the Beach Boys were the first group to make an entire album that departed from the usual small @-@ ensemble electric rock band format .
academic Bill Martin states that they opened a path in rock music &quot; that went from &quot; S@@ g@@ t. Pep@@ per &apos;s &quot; to &quot; Close to the Edge &quot; and beyond . &quot; he argues that the advancing technology of multi@@ track recording and mixing boards were more influential to experimental rock than electronic instruments such as the synthe@@ siz@@ er , allowing the Beatles and the Beach Boys to become the first crop of non @-@ class@@ ically trained musicians to create extended and complex compositions .
in &quot; S@@ tran@@ ge S@@ ounds : off@@ beat Instruments and S@@ onic Experi@@ ments in Pop &quot; , Mark Br@@ end writes of the &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations &quot; single :
other artists and producers , notably the Beatles and Phil Spec@@ tor , had used varied instrumentation and multi @-@ tracking to create complex studio productions before .
and others , like Roy Or@@ b@@ ison , had written complicated pop songs before .
but &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations &quot; eclip@@ sed all that came before it , in both its complexity as a production and the liberties it took with conventional notions of how to structure a pop song .
the making of &quot; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations , &quot; according to D@@ omen@@ ic Pri@@ ore , was &quot; unlike anything previous in the realms of classical , jazz , international , sound@@ track , or any other kind of recording , &quot; while bi@@ ographer Peter A@@ mes Car@@ lin wrote that it &quot; sounded like nothing that had ever been played on the radio before . &quot; it contained previously un@@ tried mixes of instruments , and was the first successful pop song to have cel@@ los in a jud@@ dering rhythm .
mus@@ ic@@ ologist Charlie Gil@@ lett called it &quot; one of the first records to flaun@@ t studio production as a quality in its own right , rather than as a means of presenting a performance . &quot; again , Brian employed the use of Electr@@ o @-@ Ther@@ em@@ in for the track .
upon release , the single prompted an unexpected revival in ther@@ em@@ ins while increasing awareness of analog synthe@@ siz@@ ers , leading M@@ oo@@ g Music to produce their own brand of ribbon @-@ controlled instruments .
in a 1968 editorial for &quot; Jazz &amp; Pop &quot; , Gene S@@ cul@@ at@@ ti predicted that the song &quot; may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance ... In no minor way , &apos; Good Vi@@ br@@ ations &apos; is a primary influential piece for all producing rock artists ; everyone has felt its import to some degree . &quot; discussing &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; , Daniel Harrison argues that the album could &quot; almost &quot; be considered art music in the Western classical tradition , and that the group &apos;s innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced at@@ onal and other non@@ traditional techniques into that classical tradition .
he explains , &quot; The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable ... as it is in , say , Scho@@ enberg &apos;s op . 11 piano pieces . &quot; however , such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the class@@ ically minded at the time .
sunflower &quot; marked an end to the experimental song@@ writing and production phase initiated by &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; .
after &quot; Sur@@ f &apos;s Up &quot; , Harrison wrote , their albums &quot; contain a mixture of middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few od@@ dities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead , &quot; until 1974 , &quot; the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock &apos; n &apos; roll act and became an ol@@ dies act . &quot;
</p>
<p>
for the arti@@ er branches of post @-@ punk , Wilson &apos;s pained vulnerability , his uses of off@@ beat instruments and his intricate harmon@@ ies , not to mention the &quot; S@@ mile &quot; saga itself , became a touch@@ stone , from P@@ ere U@@ bu and X@@ TC to and the Pi@@ xies to U@@ 2 and My B@@ loo@@ dy Valentine .
in the 1970s , the Beach Boys served a &quot; tot@@ emic influence &quot; on punk rock that later gave way to indi@@ e rock .
Brad Shou@@ p of Stere@@ og@@ um sur@@ mis@@ ed that , thanks to the Ram@@ ones &apos; praise for the group , many punk , pop punk , or &quot; punk @-@ adjacent &quot; artists showed influence from the Beach Boys , noting cover versions of the band &apos;s songs recorded by S@@ lic@@ kee Boys , Agent Orange , Bad Religion , S@@ hon@@ en Kn@@ ife , the Que@@ ers , Hi @-@ Standard , the D@@ onn@@ as , M.@@ O.@@ D. , and the V@@ and@@ als . &quot;
the Beach Boys Love You &quot; is sometimes considered the group &apos;s &quot; punk album . &quot; in the 1990s , the Beach Boys experienced a resurgence of popularity with the alternative rock generation .
according to Sean O &apos;@@ H@@ agan , leader of the High L@@ lam@@ as and former member of Stere@@ ol@@ ab , a younger generation of record @-@ buyers &quot; stopped listening to indi@@ e records &quot; in favor of the Beach Boys .
bands who advocated for the Beach Boys included founding members of the El@@ ephant 6 Collective .
United by a shared love of the group &apos;s music , they named P@@ et S@@ ounds Studio in honor of the band . &quot;
smile &quot; became a touch@@ stone for many bands who were labelled &quot; chamber pop , &quot; a term used for artists influenced by the lush orchestr@@ ations of Brian Wilson , Lee Haz@@ le@@ wood , and Bur@@ t Bach@@ ar@@ ach . &quot;
P@@ itch@@ fork &quot; writer Mark Richardson cited &quot; S@@ mil@@ ey S@@ mile &quot; as the origin point of &quot; the kind of lo @-@ fi bedroom pop that would later propel Se@@ bad@@ oh , Animal Collective , and other characters . &quot; the &quot; Sun@@ flower &quot; track &quot; All I W@@ anna Do &quot; is also cited as one of the earliest precursors to chil@@ l@@ wave , a micro@@ genre that developed in the 2000s .
</p>
<p>
between 1965 and 1967 , the Beach Boys developed a musical and ly@@ rical sophistication that contrasted their work from before and after .
this divide was further solidified by the difference in sound between their albums and their stage performances .
when the band &apos;s studio recordings grew more complex , they were unable to effectively reproduce them in their live show .
starting in 1966 , band public@@ ist Derek Taylor was instrumental in campaigning the idea of Brian Wilson as a &quot; genius &quot; to members of the burgeoning rock press , painting him as a mastermind who stays at home composing while the rest of the band tour .
all of these elements combined to create a split fan@@ base corresponding to two distinct musical markets .
one group is the conservative audience who enjoys the band &apos;s early singles as a wholesome representation of American popular culture from before the political and social movements brought on in the mid 1960s .
the other group also appreciates the early songs for their energy and complexity , but not as much as the band &apos;s ambitious work that was created during the formative psych@@ ed@@ elic era .
initially , rock music journalists valued the Beach Boys &apos; early records over their experimental work .
real sur@@ fers were critical of the band for not being true adherents of the sport .
as authenticity became a higher concern among critics , the group &apos;s legitimacy in rock music became an oft @-@ repeated criticism , especially since their early songs appeared to celebrate a politically unconscious youth culture .
generally , the record @-@ buying public came to view the music made after &quot; S@@ mile &quot; as the point marking their artistic decline .

Bou@@ dic@@ a or Bou@@ dic@@ ca was a queen of the British Celtic I@@ cen@@ i tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61 , and died shortly after its failure , having supposedly poisoned herself .
she is considered a British folk hero .
Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s husband , Pra@@ su@@ tag@@ us , ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome , and left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and to the Roman emperor in his will .
however , when he died , his will was ignored , and the kingdom was annexed and his property taken .
according to Tac@@ itus , Bou@@ dic@@ a was f@@ logged and her daughters raped .
Cassi@@ us Di@@ o explains Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s response by saying that previous imperial donations to influential Britons were confiscated and the Roman financier and philosopher Sen@@ eca called in the loans he had forced on the reluctant Britons .
in AD 60 or 61 , when the Roman governor Gai@@ us Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us Paul@@ in@@ us was campaigning on the island of Angl@@ es@@ ey off the northwest coast of Wales , Bou@@ dic@@ a led the I@@ cen@@ i , the Trin@@ ov@@ antes , and others in revolt .
they destroyed Cam@@ ul@@ od@@ un@@ um , earlier the capital of the Trin@@ ov@@ antes but at that time a col@@ onia , a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers and site of a temple to the former Emperor Clau@@ dius .
upon hearing of the revolt , Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us hurried to Lon@@ d@@ inium , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old commercial settlement that was the rebels &apos; next target .
he lacked sufficient numbers to defend the settlement , and he evacuated and abandoned Lon@@ d@@ inium .
Bou@@ dic@@ a led a very large army of I@@ cen@@ i , Trin@@ ov@@ antes , and others to defeat a detachment of Leg@@ io IX Hispan@@ a , and they burned and destroyed Lon@@ d@@ inium and Ver@@ ul@@ am@@ ium .
an estimated 70,000 @-@ 80,000 Romans and British were then killed in the three cities by those led by Bou@@ dic@@ a , many by torture .
Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us , meanwhile , regrouped his forces , possibly in the West Mid@@ lands ; despite being heavily outnumbered , he decisively defeated the Britons .
the crisis caused N@@ ero to consider withdrawing all Roman forces from Britain , but Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us &apos; victory over Bou@@ dic@@ a confirmed Roman control of the province .
Bou@@ dic@@ a then either killed herself to avoid capture , or died of illness .
interest in these events was revived in the English Renaissance and led to Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s fame in the Victorian era .
Bou@@ dic@@ a has remained an important cultural symbol in the United Kingdom .
</p>
<p>
Bou@@ dic@@ a has been known by several versions of her name .
Rap@@ hael Hol@@ in@@ shed calls her Vo@@ ad@@ ic@@ ia , while Edmund S@@ pens@@ er calls her Bun@@ duc@@ a , a version of the name that was used in the popular Jac@@ o@@ bean play &quot; Bon@@ duc@@ a &quot; , in 1612 .
William Cow@@ per &apos;s poem , &quot; Bo@@ ad@@ ic@@ ea , an ode &quot; popul@@ ar@@ ised an alternative version of the name .
from the 19th century until the late 20th century , Bo@@ ad@@ ic@@ ea was the most common version of the name , which is probably derived from a mistr@@ ans@@ cri@@ ption when a manuscript of Tac@@ itus was copied in the Middle Ages .
her name was clearly spelled Bou@@ dic@@ ca in the best manuscripts of Tac@@ itus , but also Β@@ ο@@ υ@@ δ@@ ο@@ υ@@ ι@@ κ@@ α , Β@@ ο@@ υ@@ ν@@ δ@@ ο@@ υ@@ ι@@ κ@@ α , and Β@@ ο@@ δ@@ ο@@ υ@@ ι@@ κ@@ α in the epitome of Cassi@@ us Di@@ o .
Kenneth Jackson concludes , based on later development of Welsh and Irish , that the name derives from the Pro@@ to @-@ Celtic feminine adjective &quot; * bou@@ d@@ ī@@ k@@ ā &quot; , &quot; victorious , &quot; that in turn is derived from the Celtic word &quot; The closest English equivalent to the vowel in the first syllable is the &quot; ow &quot; in &quot; bow @-@ and @-@ arrow . &quot;
John Rh@@ ys suggested that the most comparable Latin name , in meaning only , would be &quot; Victor@@ ina . &quot;
</p>
<p>
it is agreed that Bou@@ dic@@ a was of royal descent .
Cassi@@ us Di@@ o describes her as tall , with ta@@ w@@ ny hair hanging down to below her waist , a harsh voice and a piercing glare .
he writes that she habitually wore a large golden necklace , a colourful tun@@ ic , and a thick cloak fastened by a bro@@ och .
Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s husband , Pra@@ su@@ tag@@ us , was the king of the I@@ cen@@ i , a people who inhabited roughly what is now Nor@@ folk .
during Clau@@ dius &apos;s conquest of southern Britain in AD 43 , the I@@ cen@@ i initially allied with Rome .
they were proud of their independence , and had revol@@ ted in AD 47 when the then Roman governor Publ@@ ius O@@ stor@@ ius S@@ cap@@ ula planned to disarm all the peoples in the area of Britain under Roman control following a number of local uprisings .
O@@ stor@@ ius defeated them and went on to put down other uprisings around Britain .
the I@@ cen@@ i remained independent , under Pra@@ su@@ tag@@ us .
it is unknown whether he became the king only after O@@ stor@@ ius &apos;s defeat of the I@@ cen@@ i ;
Tac@@ itus does not date the start of Pra@@ su@@ tag@@ us &apos;s reign and first mentioned him , as a long @-@ re@@ igning king who had died , when he wrote about Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s rebellion .
Tac@@ itus mentions longstanding reasons for the Trin@@ ov@@ antes to hate Rome :
&quot; it was against the veterans that their hatred was most intense . for these new settlers in the colony of Cam@@ ul@@ od@@ un@@ um drove people out of their houses , ejected them from their farms , called them captives and slaves .... &quot; The immediate cause of the rebellion was gross mistreatment by the Romans .
Tac@@ itus wrote , &quot; The I@@ cen@@ ian king Pra@@ su@@ tag@@ us , celebrated for his long prosperity , had named the emperor his heir , together with his two daughters ; an act of deference which he thought would place his kingdom and household beyond the risk of injury . the result was contrary - so much so that his kingdom was pill@@ aged by centu@@ ri@@ ons , his household by slaves ; as though they had been prizes of war . &quot; he added that Bou@@ dic@@ a was lashed , her two daughters were raped , and that the estates of the leading I@@ cen@@ i men were confiscated .
Cassi@@ us Di@@ o wrote : &quot; an excuse for the war was found in the confiscation of the sums of money that Clau@@ dius had given to the foremost Britons ; for these sums , as Deci@@ anus C@@ atus , the procurator of the island maintained , were to be paid back . &quot; he also said that another reason was &quot; the fact that Sen@@ eca , in the hope of receiving a good rate of interest , had lent to the islanders 40@@ ,000,000 se@@ ster@@ ces that they did not want , and had afterwards called in this loan all at once and had resorted to severe measures in exacting it . &quot;

in AD 60 or 61 , while the current governor , Gai@@ us Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us Paul@@ in@@ us , was leading a campaign against the island of Mona in the north of Wales , which was a refuge for British rebels and a stronghold of the dru@@ ids , the I@@ cen@@ i conspired with their neighbours the Trin@@ ov@@ antes , amongst others , to revolt .
Bou@@ dic@@ a was chosen as their leader .
Tac@@ itus records that she addressed her army with these words , &quot; It is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry , but as one of the people that I am aven@@ ging lost freedom , my scour@@ ged body , the outraged chastity of my daughters , &quot; and concluded , &quot; This is a woman &apos;s resolve ; as for men , they may live and be slaves . &quot; according to Tac@@ itus , they drew inspiration from the example of Ar@@ mini@@ us , the prince of the Cher@@ us@@ ci who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9 , and their own ancestors who had driven Julius Caesar from Britain .
Di@@ o says that at the outset Bou@@ dic@@ a employed a form of div@@ ination , releasing a hare from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction in which it ran , and invoked An@@ dra@@ ste , a British goddess of victory .
the rebels &apos; first target was Cam@@ ul@@ od@@ un@@ um , the former Trin@@ ov@@ anti@@ an capital and , at that time , a Roman col@@ onia .
the Roman veterans who had been settled there had mistreated the locals , and a temple to the former emperor Clau@@ dius had been erected there at local expense , making the city a focus for resentment .
the Roman inhabitants sought reinforcements from the procurator , C@@ atus Deci@@ anus , but he sent only two hundred auxiliary troops .
Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s army fell on the poorly defended city and destroyed it , besieg@@ ing the last defenders in the temple for two days before it fell .
archaeologists have shown that the city was metho@@ dically demolished .
the future governor Quin@@ tus Pe@@ til@@ li@@ us Cer@@ i@@ alis , then commanding the Leg@@ io IX &quot; Hispan@@ a &quot; , attempted to relieve the city , but suffered an overwhelming defeat .
the infantry with him were all killed - only the commander and some of his cavalry escaped .
&quot; the victorious enemy met Peti@@ li@@ us Cer@@ i@@ alis , commander of the ninth leg@@ ion , as he was coming to the rescue , routed his troops , and destroyed all his infantry . Cer@@ i@@ alis escaped with some cavalry into the camp , and was saved by its forti@@ fications . &quot; the location of this battle is unknown , but has been claimed by some modern localities .
after this defeat , C@@ atus Deci@@ anus fled to G@@ aul .
when news of the rebellion reached Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us , he hurried along Wat@@ ling Street through hostile territory to Lon@@ d@@ inium .
Lon@@ d@@ inium was a relatively new settlement , founded after the conquest of AD 43 , but it had grown to be a thriving commercial centre with a population of traders , and , probably , Roman officials .
Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us considered giving battle there , but considering his lack of numbers and cha@@ st@@ ened by Pe@@ til@@ li@@ us &apos;s defeat , decided to sacrifice the city to save the province .
alarmed by this disaster and by the fury of the province which he had go@@ aded into war by his rap@@ acity , the procurator C@@ atus crossed over into G@@ aul .
Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us , however , with wonderful resolution , marched amidst a hostile population to Lon@@ d@@ inium , which , though un@@ distinguished by the name of a colony , was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels .
uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war , as he looked round on his scanty force of soldiers , and remembered with what a serious warning the rash@@ ness of Pe@@ til@@ li@@ us had been punished , he resolved to save the province at the cost of a single town .
nor did the tears and weeping of the people , as they impl@@ ored his aid , deter him from giving the signal of departure and receiving into his army all who would go with him .
those who were chained to the spot by the weakness of their sex , or the infirmity of age , or the attractions of the place , were cut off by the enemy . - Tac@@ itus Lon@@ d@@ inium was abandoned to the rebels , who burnt it down , torturing and killing anyone who had not evacuated with Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us .
archaeology shows a thick red layer of burnt debris covering coins and pottery dating before AD 60 within the bounds of Roman Lon@@ d@@ inium ; while Roman @-@ era sk@@ ulls found in the Wal@@ brook in 2013 may have been victims of the rebels .
Ver@@ ul@@ am@@ ium was next to be destroyed .
in the three settlements destroyed , between seventy and eighty thousand people are said to have been killed .
Tac@@ itus says that the Britons had no interest in taking or selling prisoners , only in slaughter by gib@@ bet , fire , or cross .
Di@@ o &apos;s account gives more detail ; that the noblest women were imp@@ aled on spikes and had their breasts cut off and sewn to their mouths , &quot; to the accompaniment of sacrifices , ban@@ quets , and wanton behaviour &quot; in sacred places , particularly the groves of An@@ dra@@ ste .
</p>
<p>
while Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s army continued their assault in Ver@@ ul@@ am@@ ium , Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us regrouped his forces .
according to Tac@@ itus , he amassed a force including his own Leg@@ io XIV &quot; Gem@@ ina &quot; , some &quot; vex@@ ill@@ ation@@ es &quot; of the XX &quot; Val@@ eria Vic@@ tri@@ x &quot; , and any available auxiliaries .
the prefect of Leg@@ io II Augu@@ sta , Po@@ en@@ ius Post@@ um@@ us , ignored the call , and a fourth leg@@ ion , IX Hispan@@ a , had been routed trying to relieve Cam@@ ul@@ od@@ un@@ um , but nonetheless the governor now commanded an army of almost ten thousand men .
Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us took a stand at an unidentified location , probably in the West Mid@@ lands somewhere along the Roman road now known as Wat@@ ling Street , in a def@@ ile with a wood behind him - but his men were heavily outnumbered .
Di@@ o says that , even if they were lined up one deep , they would not have extended the length of Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s line .
by now the rebel forces were said to have numbered 230,000 @-@ 300,000 .
Bou@@ dic@@ a exhor@@ ted her troops from her chariot , her daughters beside her .
Tac@@ itus records her giving a short speech in which she presents herself not as an arist@@ ocrat aven@@ ging her lost wealth , but as an ordinary person , aven@@ ging her lost freedom , her battered body , and the abused chastity of her daughters .
she said their cause was just , and the de@@ ities were on their side ; the one leg@@ ion that had dared to face them had been destroyed .
she , a woman , was resolved to win or die ; if the men wanted to live in slavery , that was their choice .
at first , the leg@@ ion@@ aries stood motionless , keeping to the def@@ ile as a natural protection : then , when the closer advance of the enemy had enabled them to exhaust their missiles with certi@@ tude of aim , they dashed forward in a wedge @-@ like formation .
the auxiliaries charged in the same style ; and the cavalry , with lan@@ ces extended , broke a way through any parties of resolute men whom they encountered .
the remainder took to flight , although escape was difficult , as the cordon of wagons had blocked the outlets .
the troops gave no quarter even to the women : the baggage animals themselves had been spe@@ ared and added to the pile of bodies .
the glory won in the course of the day was remarkable , and equal to that of our older victories : for , by some accounts , little less than eighty thousand Britons fell , at a cost of some four hundred Romans killed and a not much greater number of wounded .
Bou@@ dic@@ a ended her days by poison ; while Po@@ en@@ ius Post@@ um@@ us , camp @-@ prefect of the second leg@@ ion , informed of the exploits of the men of the fourteenth and twentieth , and conscious that he had cheated his own corps of a share in the honours and had violated the rules of the service by ignoring the orders of his commander , ran his sword through his body .
according to Tac@@ itus in his &quot; Ann@@ als &quot; , Bou@@ dic@@ a poisoned herself , though in the Ag@@ ric@@ ola which was written almost twenty years before the &quot; Ann@@ als &quot; he mentions nothing of suicide and attributes the end of the revolt to soc@@ or@@ dia ;
Di@@ o says she fell sick and died and then was given a lavish burial .
C@@ atus Deci@@ anus , who had fled to G@@ aul , was replaced by Gai@@ us Julius Al@@ pin@@ us Class@@ ici@@ anus .
Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us conducted punitive operations , but criticism by Class@@ ici@@ anus led to an investigation headed by N@@ ero &apos;s freed@@ man Pol@@ ycl@@ itus .
fearing Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us &apos;s actions would provoke further rebellion , N@@ ero replaced the governor with the more conciliatory Publ@@ ius Petr@@ oni@@ us Tur@@ p@@ ili@@ anus .
the historian Gai@@ us Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us Tran@@ qu@@ illus tells us the crisis had almost persuaded N@@ ero to abandon Britain .
no historical records tell what had happened to Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s two daughters .
</p>
<p>
the location of Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s defeat is unknown .
many historians favour a site in the West Mid@@ lands , somewhere along the Roman road now known as Wat@@ ling Street .
Kevin K. Car@@ roll suggests a site close to High Cross , Le@@ ic@@ ester@@ shire , on the junction of Wat@@ ling Street and the Fos@@ se Way , which would have allowed the Leg@@ io II Augu@@ sta , based at Ex@@ eter , to rendezvous with the rest of Su@@ et@@ oni@@ us &apos;s forces , had they not failed to do so .
Man@@ du@@ es@@ se@@ dum , near the modern town of A@@ ther@@ stone in War@@ w@@ ick@@ shire , has also been suggested , and according to legend &quot; The Ram@@ part &quot; near M@@ essing , Es@@ sex and Amb@@ res@@ bury Banks in E@@ pping Forest .
more recently , a discovery of Roman artefacts in Kings Norton close to Met@@ ch@@ ley Camp has suggested another possibility , and a thorough examination of a stretch of Wat@@ ling Street between St. Al@@ bans , Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s last known location , and the Fos@@ se Way junction has suggested the C@@ uttle Mill area of Paul@@ er@@ sp@@ ury in North@@ amp@@ ton@@ shire , which has topography very closely matching that described by Tac@@ itus of the scene of the battle , and where large quantities of human bones of both sexes , and including children , have been found over a wide area together with fragments of Roman pottery from the 1st century .
in 2009 , it was suggested that the I@@ cen@@ i were returning to East Ang@@ lia along the I@@ ck@@ ni@@ eld Way when they encountered the Roman army in the vicinity of Ar@@ bury Banks , Her@@ t@@ ford@@ shire .
in March 2010 , evidence was published suggesting the site may be located at Church St@@ owe , North@@ amp@@ ton@@ shire .

in his 6th century work &quot; On the Ru@@ in and Con@@ quest of Britain &quot; , the monk Gil@@ das demonstrates his knowledge of a female leader who he describes as &quot; treacherous &quot; :
&quot; &quot; a treacherous lion@@ ess but@@ ch@@ ered the governors who had been left to give fuller voice and strength to the endeavors of Roman rule &quot; &quot; . &quot;
Bud@@ dug &quot; has yet to be conclusively identified within the can@@ on of medieval Welsh literature and she is not apparent in the Hist@@ oria Brit@@ ton@@ um , the Mab@@ ino@@ gi@@ on or Geoffrey of Mon@@ mouth &apos;s &quot; History of the Kings of Britain &quot; .
the area of King &apos;s Cross , London was previously a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the River Fleet .
the original name of the bridge was Broad Ford Bridge .
the name &quot; Battle Bridge &quot; led to a tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the I@@ cen@@ i tribe led by Bou@@ dic@@ a .
the tradition is not supported by any historical evidence and is rejected by modern historians .
there is a belief that she was buried between platforms 9 and 10 in King &apos;s Cross station in London , England .
there is no evidence for this and it is probably a post @-@ World War II invention .
the first English writings appear during the reign of Queen Elizabeth following the re@@ discovery of the works of Tac@@ itus .
Poly@@ d@@ ore Ver@@ g@@ il may have reintroduced her to British history as &quot; Vo@@ ad@@ ic@@ ea &quot; in 1534 .
Rap@@ hael Hol@@ in@@ shed also included her story in his &quot; Chron@@ icles &quot; , based on Tac@@ itus and Di@@ o , and inspired Shakespeare &apos;s younger contemporaries Francis Be@@ a@@ um@@ ont and John Fletcher to write a play , &quot; Bon@@ duc@@ a &quot; , in 16@@ 10 .
William Cow@@ per wrote a popular poem , &quot; Bo@@ ad@@ ic@@ ea , an ode , &quot; in 17@@ 82 .
it was in the Victorian era that Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s fame took on legendary proportions as Queen Victoria came to be seen as Bou@@ dic@@ a &apos;s &quot; names@@ ake , &quot; their names being identical in meaning .
Victoria &apos;s Po@@ et Laureate , Alfred , Lord Tenn@@ yson , wrote a poem , &quot; Bo@@ ad@@ ic@@ ea , &quot; and several ships were named after her .

<p>
&quot; Bo@@ ad@@ ic@@ ea and Her Dau@@ ghters &quot; , a statue of the queen in her war chariot was executed by Thomas Thor@@ ny@@ cro@@ ft over the 18@@ 50s and 18@@ 60s with the encouragement of Prince Albert , who lent his horses for use as models .
Thor@@ ny@@ cro@@ ft exhibited the head separately in 1864 .
it was cast in bronze in 19@@ 02 , 17 years after Thor@@ ny@@ cro@@ ft &apos;s death , by his son Sir John , who presented it to the London County Council .
they erected it on a pl@@ in@@ th on the Victoria Em@@ bank@@ ment next to Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament , inscribed with the following lines from Cow@@ per &apos;s poem : regions Caesar never knew Thy posterity shall sway .
the great anti @-@ imperialist rebel was now identified with the head of the British Empire , and her statue stood guard over the city she razed to the ground .
Bou@@ dic@@ a was chosen by the Welsh public as one of eleven statues of historical figures to be included in the Mar@@ ble Hall at Cardiff City Hall .
the statue was unveiled by David Lloyd George on 27 October 1916 .
the popularity of Bud@@ dug alongside other Welsh heroes such as Saint David and Ow@@ ain G@@ lyn@@ d@@ ŵ@@ r was surprising to many - of the statues Bud@@ dug is the most ancient , the only female , and the only antec@@ edent from outside the modern Welsh nation . , pp. 21 @-@ 6

B@@ éla Viktor J@@ á@@ nos Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k was a Hungarian composer , pianist , and ethn@@ om@@ us@@ ic@@ ologist .
he is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century ; he and Lis@@ z@@ t are regarded as Hungary &apos;s greatest composers .
through his collection and analytical study of folk music , he was one of the founders of comparative mus@@ icology , which later became ethn@@ om@@ us@@ icology .
</p>
<p>
Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k was born in the Ban@@ ati@@ an town of Nag@@ ys@@ z@@ ent@@ mi@@ kl@@ ós in the Kingdom of Hungary , Austria @-@ Hungary on 25 March 18@@ 81 .
Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k had a diverse ancestry .
on his father &apos;s side , the Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k family was a Hungarian lower noble family , originating from Bor@@ so@@ d@@ s@@ zir@@ á@@ k , Bor@@ so@@ d .
although his paternal grandmother was from a Catholic Serbian family , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k &apos;s father , also named B@@ éla , considered himself to be an ethnic @-@ born Hungarian .
B@@ éla Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k &apos;s mother , Paula , an ethnic German , spoke Hungarian fluently .
she was a native of Tur@@ ó@@ c@@ sz@@ ent@@ m@@ ár@@ ton .
Paula also had Mag@@ yar and Slav@@ ic ancestors .
B@@ éla displayed notable musical talent very early in life : according to his mother , he could distinguish between different dance rhythms that she played on the piano before he learned to speak in complete sentences .
by the age of four he was able to play 40 pieces on the piano and his mother began formally teaching him the next year .
B@@ éla was a small and sickly child and suffered from severe eczema until the age of five .
in 1888 , when he was seven , his father died suddenly .
his mother then took him and his sister , Er@@ z@@ sé@@ bet , to live in Nag@@ ys@@ z@@ ő@@ l@@ ő@@ s and then to Poz@@ s@@ ony .
he gave his first public recital aged 11 in Nag@@ ys@@ z@@ ő@@ l@@ ő@@ s , to a warm critical reception .
among the pieces he played was his own first composition , written two years previously : a short piece called &quot; The Course of the Danube &quot; .
shortly thereafter L@@ á@@ sz@@ l@@ ó Er@@ kel accepted him as a pupil .
</p>
<p>
from 1899 to 1903 , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k studied piano under Ist@@ v@@ án Thom@@ án , a former student of Franz Lis@@ z@@ t , and composition under J@@ á@@ nos Ko@@ ess@@ ler at the Royal Academy of Music in Budapest .
there he met Z@@ ol@@ t@@ án Kod@@ á@@ ly , who made a strong impression on him and became a lifelong friend and colleague .
in 1903 , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k wrote his first major orchestr@@ al work , Ko@@ s@@ su@@ th , a sym@@ ph@@ onic poem which honored La@@ jos Ko@@ s@@ su@@ th , hero of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 .
the music of Richard Strauss , whom he met in 19@@ 02 at the Budapest premiere of &quot; Also spr@@ ach Zar@@ ath@@ u@@ stra &quot; , strongly influenced his early work .
when visiting a holiday resort in the summer of 1904 , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k overheard a young nanny , Li@@ di D@@ ó@@ sa from Ki@@ b@@ é@@ d in Tran@@ sylvania , sing folk songs to the children in her care .
this sparked his lifelong dedication to folk music .
from 1907 , he also began to be influenced by the French composer Claude De@@ bus@@ sy , whose compositions Kod@@ á@@ ly had brought back from Paris .
Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k &apos;s large @-@ scale orchestr@@ al works were still in the style of Johann@@ es Brah@@ ms and Richard Strauss , but he wrote a number of small piano pieces which showed his growing interest in folk music .
the first piece to show clear signs of this new interest is the Str@@ ing Quartet No. 1 in A minor , which contains folk @-@ like elements .
in 1907 , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k began teaching as a piano professor at the Royal Academy .
this position freed him from touring Europe as a pianist and enabled him to work in Hungary .
among his notable students were F@@ ritz Re@@ iner , Sir Ge@@ org Sol@@ ti , Gy@@ ör@@ gy Sán@@ dor , Er@@ n@@ ő Balo@@ gh , and L@@ ili Kra@@ us .
after Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k moved to the United States , he taught Jack Be@@ eson and Viol@@ et Archer .
in 1908 , he and Kod@@ á@@ ly traveled into the countryside to collect and research old Mag@@ yar folk melodies .
their growing interest in folk music coincided with a contemporary social interest in traditional national culture .
they made some surprising discoveries .
Mag@@ yar folk music had previously been categor@@ ised as Gypsy music .
the classic example is Franz Lis@@ z@@ t &apos;s famous &quot; Hungarian R@@ hap@@ so@@ dies &quot; for piano , which he based on popular art songs performed by Romani bands of the time .
in contrast , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k and Kod@@ á@@ ly discovered that the old Mag@@ yar folk melodies were based on pent@@ at@@ onic scales , similar to those in Asian folk traditions , such as those of Central Asia , Anatol@@ ia and Siberia .
Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k and Kod@@ á@@ ly quickly set about incorporating elements of such Mag@@ yar peasant music into their compositions .
they both frequently quoted folk song melodies &quot; verbatim &quot; and wrote pieces derived entirely from authentic songs .
an example is his two volumes entitled &quot; For Children &quot; for solo piano , containing 80 folk tunes to which he wrote accompaniment .
Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k &apos;s style in his art music compositions was a synthesis of folk music , class@@ icism , and modernism .
his melo@@ dic and harmonic sense was profoundly influenced by the folk music of Hungary , Romania , and other nations .
he was especially fond of the asymmetrical dance rhythms and pungent harmon@@ ies found in Bulgarian music .
most of his early compositions offer a blend of nationalist and late Roman@@ ticism elements .
</p>
<p>
in 19@@ 09 , at the age of 28 , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k married M@@ ár@@ ta Ziegler , aged 16 .
their son , B@@ éla Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k III , was born on 22 August 1910 .
after nearly 15 years together , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k divorced M@@ ár@@ ta in June 1923 .
two months after his divorce , he married D@@ it@@ ta P@@ á@@ sz@@ tory , a piano student , ten days after proposing to her .
she was aged 19 , he 42 .
their son , Pé@@ ter , was born in 1924 .
</p>
<p>
in 1911 , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k wrote what was to be his only opera , &quot; Blu@@ e@@ beard &apos;s Castle &quot; , dedicated to M@@ ár@@ ta .
he entered it for a prize by the Hungarian Fine Arts Commission , but they rejected his work as not fit for the stage .
in 1917 Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k revised the score for the 1918 premi@@ ère , and re@@ wrote the ending .
following the 1919 revolution in which he actively participated , he was pressured by the Hor@@ thy regime to remove the name of the lib@@ ret@@ tist B@@ éla Bal@@ á@@ z@@ s from the opera , as he was black@@ listed and had left the country for Vienna . &quot;
Blu@@ e@@ beard &apos;s Castle &quot; received only one revival , in 1936 , before Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k emigrated .
for the remainder of his life , although he was passionately devoted to Hungary , its people and its culture , he never felt much loyalty to the government or its official establishments .
</p>
<p>
after his disappointment over the Fine Arts Commission competition , Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k wrote little for two or three years , preferring to concentrate on collecting and arranging folk music .
he collected first in the Car@@ path@@ ian Basin , where he not@@ ated Hungarian , Slovak , Romanian , and Bulgarian folk music .
he also collected in Mol@@ da@@ via , Wall@@ achi@@ a , and Algeria .
the outbreak of World War I forced him to stop the expeditions ; and he returned to composing , writing the ballet &quot; The Woo@@ den Prince &quot; and the Str@@ ing Quartet No. 2 in , both influenced by De@@ bus@@ sy .
raised as a Catholic , by his early adulthood Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k had become an athe@@ ist .
he later became attracted to Un@@ itarianism and publicly converted to the Un@@ itarian faith in 1916 .
