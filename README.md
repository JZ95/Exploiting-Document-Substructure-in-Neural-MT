# Exploiting Predictable Document Sub-structure in NMT

## Intro

## Model Architecutre

## Training strategy
1. Train baseline NMT (sent-independent)
2. Train text clf (reusing the word embedding and word-level encoder in the baseline-NMT)
3. Finetuning the context-aware NMT

## Usage
```
cd nematus
python setup.py develop  # install nematus in dev mode
```

## Nematus
This project is based on nematus v0.4, specifically the [commit 75a168d247e50a746a717be0ac514e7c314246d3](https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/nematus/tree/75a168d247e50a746a717be0ac514e7c314246d3). You are free to replace the dir `nematus` with any version of it, but only backward compatibility is guaranteed (maintained by EdinNLP Group).
